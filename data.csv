New York (CNN Business)SpaceX is ready to deploy 64 satellites in one fell swoop — a record-setting mission.Elon Musk's company is scheduled to launch a rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Monday between 1:32 pm and 2 pm ET after a series of delays triggered by bad weather and last-minute inspections for the rocket. It will be one of the largest satellite ride-sharing missions ever launched and the most crowded single mission in US history according to Spaceflight SpaceX's customer for the launch.The mission illustrates the growing demand to launch small satellites modern devices that some companies hope will empower an array of new businesses — from internet service to supply chain monitoring. For SpaceX Monday's mission called SSO-A will mark its 19th launch of 2018 surpassing its previous annual record of 18 launches last year.It will also be the first time Musk's company will attempt to send one of its rocket boosters to space for a third time. SpaceX's goal is to drastically reduce the cost of a launch by reusing the hardware a feat its competitors long thought was impossible or uneconomical.The first-stage booster lined up for the SSO-A mission has flown twice in the past six months — first on May 11 for the Bangabandhu mission and again August 7 for Merah Putih.Satellite ride sharingSpaceX's customer for this mission Spaceflight aims to be a sort of Uber service for space. The company has for years worked as a liaison between small satellite companies and launch providers looking to put small payloads onto rockets with extra room on board.  "We started off just selling the excess capacity on whatever launches were out there" Spaceflight president Curt Blake told CNN Business in a recent interview. "Then we said 'Wow demand is so big we should just buy a whole rocket ourselves.' That's how this mission came to be."SSO-A will be the first time Spaceflight has filled a rocket entirely with its small satellite customers. They come from 34 companies and organizations across 17 countries.They include Australia-based Fleet Space Technologies which aims to connect remote devices to the internet via satellite. Two companies — US-based Capella Space Corporation and Finland's ICEYE — will launch satellites that seek to use advanced radars to track airplanes or ships even in cloudy weather. A group of middle school students from Florida is sending an experimental astrobiology satellite. And an art project funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art that pays homage to the first African American astronaut Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. will also take flight.Deploying all 64 satellites safely is tricky business. The devices which span a variety of shapes and sizes will ride to space affixed to sides of a large metal structure called a payload stack that will be shielded by the Falcon 9's nose cone during launch. Once in orbit the nose cone will fall away and the satellites will pop off from the payload stack in a carefully orchestrated sequence.Crowded ridesharing missions like this one have been executed before. India's space agency last year shattered a world record by launching 104 small satellites with a single rocket. Another mission from Russia in 2014 deployed 37 satellites.Smallsats and space debrisThere is a massive backlog of small satellites waiting to get to orbit. And companies including SpaceX and OneWeb are racing to send constellations of thousands of high-speed internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.While hitching a ride with larger payloads is considered the cheapest option for getting to space many nascent rocket companies are promising lightweight rockets that can be mass produced and make cheap frequent trips to orbit.One such company US-based Rocket Lab became the first to reach orbit and has notched two missions so far. Its backlog of customers is so long that CEO Peter Beck told CNN Business the company is "not constrained by customers right now — we're only constrained by how quickly we can build rockets."The massive influx of new satellites into low-Earth orbit poses difficult questions for the space sector particularly when it comes to orbital debris.The issue took center stage last month for the US Federal Communications Commission which authorizes telecom satellites for launch. The agency is considering updating a set of 2004 rules "seeking to keep pace with technological and market changes and to incorporate improvements in debris mitigation practices" the FCC said. ,U.S.
 (CNN)A bus crash early Monday killed one child and injured 45 other people most of them children when the driver lost control of the coach on Interstate 30 west of Benton Arkansas State Police said. The charter bus was carrying a youth all-star football team  home from a championship game played over the weekend in Dallas. It was traveling to Memphis Tennessee when it left the road and rolled over police said. During questioning the driver told police she lost control of the vehicle state police said in a statement. Authorities received a call around 2:40 a.m. (3:40 ET) and found the bus on its side near the Hot Springs exit on I-30.The children were between 8 and 10 years old and had chaperones accompanying them on the bus state police spokesman Bill Sadler said."When troopers arrived at the scene many of the children were already off of the bus" Sadler said. "Some of them were stunned or had minor injuries."The injured were taken to hospitals in Saline and Pulaski counties. Two were airlifted Sadler said. Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock about 25 miles northeast of Benton treated 20 patients in its emergency room the hospital tweeted. It does not appear that weather played a role in the crash Sadler said.Scott Shuttle Service of Somerville Tennessee operated the charter police said. The child's cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner Sadler said. CNN's Tina Burnside and Robin Meade contributed to this report. ,U.S.
New York (CNN Business)The ceasefire between the United States and China has set off a celebration on Wall Street.The Dow soared more than 400 points early Monday before giving up most of those gains. It was up 150 points at midday. Investors were pleased that China and the United States reached a temporary trade truce. It's a big relief because the damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies was set to deepen in January. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 climbed more than 0.5% apiece. "A truce is definitely better than an escalation of hostilities" Kit Juckes strategist at Societe Generale wrote to clients on Monday. Juckes said that even though investors may doubt the substance of the US-China agreement "this morning's response reflects relief and a desire to pick up some last-ditch bargains."Not surprisingly investors piled back into companies that rely on China for a significant chunk of their sales. That includes tech giants like Apple (AAPL) Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) as well as industrial companies like Boeing (BA) Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE). Tiffany (TIF) jumped 4% while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) surged 9%. "The market is thrilled to get a little bit of a reprieve" said Amanda Agati co-chief investment strategist at PNC. "But it's early to say anything is done and to cross this worry off the list. There's still a long road ahead.The relief rally comes after the S&P 500 spiked nearly 5% last week its best since December 2011. That rebound was triggered by hopes of progress on the trade front and a speech by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell that investors interpreted as a signal the central bank will not rush to raise interest rates."The China trade situation is the keystone in the arch of agita" said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The progress on talks with China means "now we have a very good chance of experiencing a Santa Claus rally" said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.It wasn't just US markets celebrating. Major indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai surged 2.5%. And markets in London Frankfurt and Paris climbed 1% or more. Commodities also raced higher. Copper and soybeans rallied. US oil prices boosted by hopes of an agreement by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut output surged 4%. After meeting on Saturday US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold their fire on tariffs while they try to reach a trade deal. Trump agreed not to raise the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for now. Those tariffs had been scheduled to automatically rise to 25% on January 1. And China said it would be willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture energy and other US products. Still some analysts warned that the celebration on Wall Street could be short-lived. China and the United States now only have 90 days to sort out nagging trade issues that have been in contention for years if not decades. And the statements that emerged from the trade meeting lacked concrete details."The beefiest part of Saturday evening's meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi may well have been the local sirloin served for dinner" Nicholas Colas co-founder of DataTrek Research wrote to clients on Monday.Goldman Sachs economists said the most likely outcomes are that the truce gets extended after 90 days or that the trade war escalates. The investment bank sees just a 20% chance over the next three months of a comprehensive deal rolling back tariffs."The specter of higher and broader US tariffs remains" Goldman Sachs chief US political economist Alec Phillips wrote to clients on Sunday.In any case the progress on trade should allow investors to refocus on the fundamentals. But economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 because of the fading impact of the tax cuts the impact of existing tariffs and higher borrowing costs. Analysts are calling for S&P 500 earnings growth to decelerate from about a blockbuster pace of 21% this year to 9% next year according to FactSet.,U.S.
Mariska Hargitay is the founder and president of the Joyful Heart Foundation and the Emmy Award-winning star of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Much has been written this year about women's anger -- its power and potential its evolution and necessity. But beneath the analysis there is the feeling itself: anger pure and simple. It's what I felt when I read CNN's report about the destruction -- the outrageous careless wrongheaded uneducated ill-informed dangerous willful destruction -- of rape kits. I have been engaged in the work to bring an end to sexual violence since 2004 the year I started the Joyful Heart Foundation which aims to heal and empower sexual assault survivors. But in truth my work goes back even further -- to the moment I learned some of the statistics about sexual assault and domestic violence in preparation for my role on "Law & Order: SVU."For example in the United States one in three women and one in six men are survivors of sexual violence. One in four women and one in seven men have suffered severe violence from an intimate partner. Those numbers alone almost made my head explode. I had that feeling again when I first learned about the backlog of untested rape kits in 2009 after a report from Human Rights Watch. I couldn't wrap my mind around it: thousands of rape kits sitting in some cases rotting in police storage facilities across the country. As Polly Poskin executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault has said "If you've got stacks of physical evidence of a crime and you're not doing everything you can with the evidence then you must be making a decision that this isn't a very serious crime." Beyond the obvious threat to public safety beyond the wasted opportunities to both prosecute the guilty and exonerate the wrongly convicted the backlog sends a devastating and inexcusable message to survivors: You don't matter. What happened to you doesn't matter. And if the backlog wasn't enough the destruction of rape kits now brings our country's attitude toward sexual assault and its victims into even sharper focus. Explore CNN's investigative report and you will learn about 99 agencies in 47 states destroying rape kits. About a detective in North Carolina who authorized the trashing of a rape kit a month after it was collected from a woman who was gang raped because the investigator didn't believe her. And about records showing kits were trashed as recently as 2016 -- with one of the objectives being to "make space in the evidence room." That is an outrageous shameful level of disregard and the system that makes it possible must change. Just as the backlog is a reflection of how we regard sexual assault and its victims in this country the individual actions and decisions by law enforcement are the outcome of deeply entrenched societal attitudes that make those actions and decisions possible. Those attitudes must be dismantled. And what must change are the laws governing the handling of rape kits. As CNN reports last year the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations for best practices about the counting tracking and testing of rape kits reforms that the federal government agrees are needed. In order to be able to hold jurisdictions accountable those recommendations must become law in all 50 states. Legally requiring the testing of rape kits and prohibiting the destruction of rape kits ensures that every survivor gets the same standard of care and rights. Importantly each survivor should also have the right -- by law -- to know the status of their rape kit and have the option of having it preserved for as long as they want. It is important to note that systemic and lasting change takes effect through state-level legislation. While agency local and county-level reforms are vital we know that perpetrators do not stop at the county limits and survivors' access to justice should not be restricted by zip code. Progress has already been made to be sure. In the last two years alone we and our partners have helped pass 34 laws to change the way rape kits are handled and are already working on legislation for 2019. Through endthebacklog.org the first and only comprehensive online hub for information about the rape kit backlog in the United States we are sharing best practices progress on reform and a way for people to join this growing effort. I also had the great privilege of telling survivors' stories who have kits in the backlog in "I Am Evidence" the documentary I produced in partnership with HBO which continues to be shown in communities across the country. In the work to bring this violence to an end -- that is the vision to which we must commit -- stark reminders like this important report from CNN confront us with how much work is left to be done. While the report's content angers me deeply perhaps that anger is not pure and simple. It also contains a renewed resolve a reminder of how much is at stake in our work and a deepened determination to create the more just society we all seek. ,U.S.
 (CNN)The family of a young woman who struggled with opioid addiction and whose moving obituary went viral is suing a Massachusetts city and police department for information about the woman's medical care in the days before her death.Madelyn Linsenmeir a 30-year-old Vermont mother died after she was arrested in September by Springfield police on outstanding warrants and providing a false name according to a police arrest log. The ACLU of Massachusetts is suing the city and its police department on behalf of Linsenmeir's family asking for documents and recordings related to her arrest detention and death. "Our family is heartbroken to have lost our beloved Madelyn" the family said according to the ACLU. Springfield Police Department spokesman Ryan Walsh and city Deputy Communications Director Darryl Moss told CNN the department is investigating the matter but had no comment on the lawsuit.Ominous text messagesThe lawsuit shares text messages between Linsenmeir and her family on September 28 showing the state of her health just before her arrest. "I need to go to the hospital I am dying i weigh 90 pounds" she texted Maureen Linsenmeir. "mom I need you."Later that day she texted her sister. "I just need to get help go to the hospital." The lawsuit alleges that at the time of her arrest Linsenmeir was allowed to call her mother with a Springfield police officer on the line. The suit alleges that Madelyn Linsenmeir was distraught and told her mother that she was not receiving medical attention. "As the conversation progressed the police officer refused to provide medical attention and even made a sarcastic comment to Maureen (Madelyn's mother) after Maureen expressed concern that Madelyn was being denied care" the complaint claims. The ACLU is looking to obtain a possible recording of this conversation as well as other requested information and documents police have not turned over.Linsenmeir was arrested September 29 and transferred to a women's correctional facility the next morning Walsh confirmed to CNN.On October 4 Linsenmeir was taken by ambulance to the Baystate Medical Center where she was admitted to the intensive care unit. On October 7 Linsenmeir died at the hospital still technically in police custody and surrounded by family.The woman's correctional facility was operated by the Hampden County Sheriff's Department. Shortly after her death Hampden County Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi told CNN in a statement that he was saddened by her death and wanted to "extend my sympathies to her family." He added that she was "under the evaluation and supervision of our correctional and medical team." The department was not named in the suit and had no further comment.'What about the rest of the victims'Around the world news outlets wrote about the powerful obituary crafted by her sister Kate O'Neill.Her obituary was shared on Facebook and her sister asked supporters to donate money to the treatment center she had turned to for help. In her Vermont hometown Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo posted on Facebook in October after seeing reactions to her obituary saying Linsenmeir's addiction and death were being treated as though nothing like this had happened before."Did readers think this was the first time a beautiful young beloved mother from a pastoral state got addicted to Oxy and died from the descent it wrought?" he wrote. "And what about the rest of the victims who weren't as beautiful and lived in downtrodden cities or the rust belt? They too had mothers who cried for them and blamed themselves."Del Pozo wrote that he was tired of arguing with sheriffs at national conferences about their deputies having to carry naloxone the opioid antagonist that can save people who are overdosing. "Maddie's gone. She can't feel your sorrow. But others are next" del Pozo wrote. "They are all human beings and they need our help. Go. Get to work."One of Linsenmeir's last public posts on her Facebook page is a black and white selfie taken in the car from August. "Enjoying this beautiful day" she wrote. Below the photo are comments from across the country. Some share stories of loved ones who died after struggling with opioid addictions and others simply leave kind messages. On his Facebook page del Pozo's final line to those who were moved by Linsenmeir's obituary: "We still need to earn the feelings her obituary inspired in us. We should have felt them years ago." ,U.S.
 (CNN)A woman trying to help what she thought was a needy mother and her baby has been fatally stabbed in Baltimore. The good Samaritan was identified by police as 52-year-old Jacquelyn Smith who was riding in a car with relatives Saturday when they saw a woman carrying what appeared to be a baby.The woman was holding a sign that read "Please Help me feed my Baby."Suspect said thank you before stabbing victim Smith of Aberdeen Maryland handed money out the car window to the woman when a man approached the vehicle. Baltimore Police said in a statement he first thanked the family for the money but then tried to grab Smith's wallet."A struggle ensued" police said and the man stabbed Smith in the torso before running away with the woman who had the sign. Smith died shortly after arriving at the hospital police told CNN. 'It makes it very difficult to help'Baltimore City District 12 Councilman Robert Stokes has spent his whole life in in East Baltimore where the homicide occurred. "It makes you wonder now if you want to roll your window down and help. It makes it hard and makes it more dangerous for people who really want to help people. It's a sad day and my condolences go out to the family" he said. "With the holidays coming up people want to help in some kind of way and it makes it very difficult to help."Police are searching for both the suspect described as a man in his 30s with a goatee and the woman with the sign who was asking for money. It's not clear if they have a baby with them. "We just gotta do something about the panhandling on the corner because if it's getting to this point it's dangerous" Stokes said. "Someone's life was taken away from them when they were trying to help.",U.S.
 (CNN)Under a cloud of grief an aura of hope and unity prevailed at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Sunday night. In its first Hanukkah ceremony since 11 congregants were gunned down at the Pittsburgh synagogue a diverse crowd gathered to worship and show their support for the Jewish community.This Hanukkah will be "unforgettable" said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of the New Light Congregation which worships at the synagogue. He told those gathered for the menorah-lighting event about the "terrible tragedy that occurred here at this building." The eleven victims were killed October 27 when a gunman made anti-Semitic comments while opening fire on the congregation a law enforcement official said. Suspect Robert Bowers has pleaded not guilty to 44 federal charges. Simcha and Chaya Teich came all the way from Brooklyn New York to support the synagogue on Sunday. "It's very nice to see all the different parts of the community band together and celebrate a Jewish holiday we all have in common" Chaya Teich told CNN affiliate KDKA. Simcha Teich noted the symbolism of the branches of the synagogue's menorah. "We can take a lesson that this is the Tree of Life Synagogue and the Menorah significantly has its branches that branch outwards not inwards" he told KDKA. "And so too the light of the Tree of Life is just like the Menorah where it branches outwards and it spreads its lights onto the people that flock to it."Pittsburgh police Detective Sgt. James Glick was selected to light the candle Sunday night on behalf of Pittsburgh police. He was assisted by survivors of the mass shooting. ,U.S.
 (CNN)The number of people still unaccounted for following the devastating Camp Fire in northern California has dropped to 25 the Butte County Sheriff's Office said.The latest count is down from a one-time high of more than 1000 people. The death toll remained at 88 on Saturday with no further remains found the sheriff's office said in a tweet.The Camp Fire burned through more than 153000 acres in Butte County after it broke out November 8. It was contained November 25 after becoming the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.The blaze decimated much of the town of Paradise and destroyed nearly 14000 homes and more than 4800 other buildings.,U.S.
 (CNN)We're only a few days into December and some people are already getting fed up with Christmas music -- like a Cleveland radio station that banned the song "Baby It's Cold Outside" because of its predatory undertones. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get "5 Things You Need to Know Today" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)1. Jamal KhashoggiSome recent revelations about the killing of a Washington Post journalist in his home country of Saudi Arabia have intensified international concern over the incident. CNN has obtained access to Jamal Khashoggi's WhatsApp messages and they show the journalist was extremely critical of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Khashoggi and the Saudi exile he was messaging with believed their conversations were intercepted by the Saudi government. This all comes days after a CIA assessment was made public that concluded that bin Salman had personally ordered Khashoggi's death. Both the Saudi government and top US officials deny there is any hard evidence linking the country's crown prince with the killing of Khashoggi in October at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The slaying has become a diplomatic crisis and the Trump Administration has been hesitant to question Saudi Arabia about what really happened. 2. FranceA third week of violent protests in France has led President Emmanuel Macron to call for a solution. Macron has asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet with heads of political parties and representatives of the so-called "yellow vest" protesters after 92 people were injured and more than 200 arrested during a Saturday protest that attracted around 36000 people. The "yellow vest" movement was formed to demonstrate against rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport. Over time the unrest has transformed into a broader demonstration against Macron his government and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor. 3. QatarThe oil-rich country of Qatar is pulling out of OPEC the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The country says it wants to focus more on natural gas production. Although Qatar's contributions to OPEC have been less than say Saudi Arabia its decision to pull out of the oil cartel is significant for a few reasons. One it's been a member for nearly 60 years. Two it reflects economic tensions in the region (Qatar has been under an economic embargo by some of its neighbors including Saudi Arabia). Three the decision comes at a time when OPEC is looking to expand its membership so Qatar's withdrawal definitely stings.  4. James ComeyJames Comey will testify in a private deposition with House Republicans this week but only under the condition that a transcript of the testimony be made public. The Former FBI Director has been a subject of interest in an investigation by the House regarding the FBI and Justice Department's handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's email practices and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Comey initially pushed back on the subpoena saying he wanted to testify in a public setting. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte officially issued subpoenas for Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch in November to bring the investigation under the wire because Goodlatte is retiring soon and the investigation will end when the Democrats take control of the house in January. 5. ChinaCould the tariff tiff between the US and China be cooling? The stock markets certainly want to believe so. Stocks jumped higher Monday morning after the two countries said they would hold fire on further tariffs for the time being and try to settle differences through talks. During the G20 summit in Argentina President Trump and Chinese President  Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce on trade. Trump agreed to maintain the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and not raise them to 25% "at this time." In exchange China agreed it was willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance.Breakfast Browse The College Football Playoff teams are set!Will the title go to the Oklahoma Sooners the Notre Dame Fighting Irish the Clemson Tigers or those scrappy underdogs the Alabama Crimson Tide?

Charlottesville Virginia (CNN)Prosecutors could rest their case as early as Tuesday in Charlottesville Virginia where James Alex Fields is standing trial for a deadly car crash at a white nationalist rally that killed one counterprotester and injured others in August 2017.Fields 21 faces a possible life sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Heather Heyer. The 32-year-old paralegal's name has become synonymous with the trauma wrought by the Unite the Right rally which made international headlines and escalated America's culture wars by bringing extremist ideologies into the open.Fields faces eight more counts related to eight people who were injured and one count of failing to stop at an accident involving a death. The trial began on Thursday in a case focused on Fields' intent. Testimony resumes Monday morning.The commonwealth contends that Fields' actions were premeditated with the intention to harm the counterprotesters. Survivors of the deadly crash testified last week that the mood among counterprotesters was upbeat and celebratory before Fields slammed his Dodge Challenger into another car triggering a chain reaction that hurled people in different directions. A stream of witnesses recounted the chaotic scene and testified to a litany of injuries they suffered in the crash some of which they are still recovering from.When defense lawyers present their case -- which could happen this week -- they are expected to call some of the same witnesses to support their version of events: that Fields acted of fear of the counterprotesters and not with criminal intent. Focus turns to Fields' behavior Those who knew Fields at his Ohio high school said he held extreme views and a fascination with Nazism. To support the argument that Fields acted out of anger toward counterprotesters the commonwealth's attorneys called a police witness to provide a step-by-step tracking of Fields' actions before during and after the incident. Charlottesville Police Det. Steven Young testified on Friday that footage from the Unite the Right rally earlier in the day shows Fields chanting homophobic and anti-Semitic slurs as he marched with others.A short time later helicopter footage shows his car driving into the crowd. "Is it fair to say Mr. Fields does not stop after hitting the crowd?" Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Nina Antony asked the detective."Yes" Young said. "He took off again then stopped."The commonwealth's attorneys said they intend to introduce images that Fields shared on Instagram three months before the deadly crash. The two memes show a car running into a group of people described as protesters. One was shared in a private message and the other in a public post. Judge Richard Moore granted the commonwealth's request to show them to the jury despite objections from the defense.Image takes center stageThe commonwealth says the memes are reminiscent of images that emerged from the scene of the deadly crash. One such image showing people flying through the air became an indelible moment -- one that earned the photographer who shot it a Pulitzer Prize. The photojournalist who captured the image testified on Friday that the Unite the Right rally was set to be his last day at the Charlottesville paper The Daily Progress.While he was watching the crowd of counterprotesters he saw the Challenger slowly backing up the hill. "I thought it was trying to get out of the way" Ryan Kelly testified.Then he said he heard tires screech and saw the car speed past him on 4th Street."I saw the car accelerate the whole way into the protestors" he said. "It was going fast into the crowd."CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.,U.S.
 (CNN)Three weeks after California's deadly wildfire scorched communities Mary Ludwig's second grade students will return to class for the first time on Monday in new surroundings.The return to school for some 32000 students in Butte County including about 5000 displaced students from Paradise could provide some normalcy for children in many California communities recovering from the Camp Fire. The blaze burned for more than two weeks killing 88 people.The Camp Fire destroyed Ludwig's Ponderosa Elementary along with most schools in the Paradise Unified School District. Ponderosa's new home for the rest of the academic year will be on another campus. Students will attend classes at Durham Elementary. Ludwig and her colleagues spent much of last week getting their classrooms ready. "I miss my students. I love my students. I miss teaching them" Ludwig 50 said Sunday in a phone interview. "I'm just excited to be with them again and to be in their life every day and to inspire them."Many Paradise Unified School District students will attend classes on other campuses in Butte County. A vacant store front in the Chico Mall has been transformed into a drop-in lab for students from Paradise High School and Paradise Intermediate School for independent learning until a permanent location can be found. "It's very emotional because when we left that day we didn't know what was going to happen" Shelly Kiefer a Paradise Elementary teacher told CNN-affiliate KGO-TV last week. 'Second first day of school'Placer County Office of Education spokesperson Kindra Britt said teachers have been trained on how to recognize trauma in students and in themselves. Even though teachers are dealing with their own trauma they've come to work every day Britt said.Experts on trauma will be on hand on the campuses KGO-TV reported. Britt said Monday will be a symbol of hope for the affected communities. "We're calling it the 'second first day of school'" she said. She added: "We might not be able to give them back their homes at this time but we can give them back their schools." Others in the community have worked to bring normalcy to the lives of students. Ludwig's classmate from Paradise High School drove two hours to drop off the backpacks of supplies for students Ludwig said. Ludwig said schools in the county have welcomed the displaced students teachers and staff.Last week a Durham staff member stood outside the school to greet Ponderosa staff members when they pulled up to the school to begin planning for Monday."That just really made the transition joyful" said Ludwig who along with a fellow teacher and bus driver helped ferry 22 Ponderosa students to safety on November 8 as the Camp Fire scorched everything in their path. Ludwig said second grade Durham teachers also brought clothes for Ponderosa teachers to pick out.She hopes to start the day slowly with art work. And they will sit together on a green rug in the middle of the classroom to read out loud. It's been a hard month she said. "It's going to be different but I think it's also going to be wonderful" she said. CNN's Silvio Carrillo contributed to this report. ,U.S.
 (CNN)Diane and Bill Kuhlmann were still on edge Sunday days after riding out an earthquake in their home of 47 years. "I didn't want to go to sleep last night. I was afraid it was gonna happen again" Diane said referring to the more than 1000 aftershocks that have shaken Alaska since Friday's big quake. In 40 years of living in Alaska the couple has lived through many earthquakes Bill Kuhlmann said. But this one was different."This one was a shaker" he said. "It just shook the heck out of everything."The couple now has the unfortunate task of cleaning up after everything in their home was tossed about including irreplaceable antiques."We had to put some lights up to make it a little brighter and cheery in here. It makes it easier to work otherwise you cry" Bill Kuhlmann said. The 7.0-magnitude earthquake sent residents scurrying for cover when it hit at about 8:30 a.m. Friday. The quake was centered 10 miles northeast of Anchorage.The majority of the aftershocks were of a magnitude 2.5 or weaker meaning they weren't likely felt. But more than 350 of the aftershocks were higher than 2.5 according to US Geological Survey data."It is about two and a half days since the 7.0 earthquake came through Anchorage and it's astounding the kind of progress that's been made" said Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz. "We've shown the rest of the country and the rest of the world that there's an Anchorage way of getting things done and we're going to continue to make progress." Alaskans resilient to damageNo fatalities or serious injuries were reported officials said. In Alaska's largest city -- with a population of about 300000 -- airports hospitals emergency services and most businesses were operating."The power is up. The heat is on. The communication lines are opening" said Anchorage Municipal Manager Bill Falsey.At this point the city doesn't have any updates or reports on condemned municipal commercial or residential buildings Falsey said.The earthquake was felt up to 400 miles away said state seismologist Michael West. He called it the most significant earthquake in Anchorage since 1964."The most striking thing about this event was that it was so close to Anchorage" said Gavin Hayes a research geophysicist with the USGS. "That's why it has caused the damage that we're seeing."'The bottom line is that everything is working'The Anchorage Water and Waste Water Utility on Sunday lifted the precautionary boil water advisory put in place Saturday making water now safe to drink Falsey said."The bottom line is that everything is working we expect it to remain working. The water from your tap is safe for all uses" he saidHe also said during a Sunday press conference that the city has gone through stages of recovery over the last three days. The first day he said was mostly focused on assessing damages arranging the necessary resources prioritizing the restoration of utilities and sheltering for life and safety. The second day was a pivot to critical infrastructure and making sure the city could run efficiently. Day three is about returning to normalcy Falsey said. "I'm very happy to report that the day one and day two tasks are a success and largely complete. The electricity is on the heat is on communication lines are up water and sewer are returning to their normal operating posture and we expect that to remain the case" he said. Meanwhile Falsey said roads are generally passable. Road crews are working 40 sites. One of the most damaged roads Glenn Highway also happens to be the most traveled road in Alaska and looked like a massive machine clawed through it on Saturday. By Sunday some progress had been made on the heavily traveled highway. The Alaska Department of Transportation requested state agencies keep employees at home because of the extensive damage on the highway. Anchorage schools are expected to open to students December 10 Superintendent Deena Bishop told CNN affiliate KTUU.A  full assessment is being conducted on the division's 92 buildings -- 82 of which are schools. Each of the 4000 classrooms are being assessed for safety precautions as well."We are doing full-scale assessments of water heating electricity as well as structural analysis with engineers" Bishop said. While Anchorage may be getting over the earthquake more weather is on the horizon. Louise Fode with the National Weather Service said Sunday the city should expect 3 to 6 inches of snow overnight into Monday. As of Sunday evening the city was seeing light rain but Fode said that's expected to change to snow between 9 and 10 p.m. Sunday and then stop by morning rush hour Monday.,U.S.
 (CNN)The federal government is headed toward a partial shutdown if Republicans and Democrats in Congress can't resolve a standoff over President Donald Trump's demands to fund the border wall. Many government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funding on December 7 if Congress does not act soon. There will almost certainly not be a shutdown this week on account of the death of former President George H.W. Bush. But according to multiple people involved consider this a brief respite from what looms ahead. The fight is still happening behind the scenes -- and will spill back into public next week. Talks between Republican and Democratic negotiators had more or less fallen apart on Friday and this weekend things haven't progressed toward a resolution at all according to several sources with direct knowledge of the talks. There now will likely be more time -- and with more time more opportunities to find a path forward. But as of Monday morning nobody in either party has a good sense of how -- or when -- this will end.As a practical matter with Bush to lie in state in the US Capitol Rotunda the bandwidth (and floor time) to move forward on a year-end funding package is limited. As a symbolic matter lawmakers wandering into yet another government shutdown this Congress is a fairly bad look given Bush's legacy as a man and president which will be remembered in detail after detail tribute after tribute all week.What to watch this weekWhen lawmakers act on a short-term stop-gap bill to give them more time before the funding deadline -- and for how long that bill extends the deadline.Days until the government shuts down: 5* (*Expect this to be extended.) The preferenceCongressional leadership spent the last 24 hours gauging the support for one- and two-week stopgap funding bills but even that has run into some issues sources say. Republicans are angling for a two-week extension while Democrats have signaled they would prefer a one-week extension.  The play for the two-week version per Republicans comes down to three fundamental reasons: More time to negotiate Opens up floor space for the raft of other must-pass legislative items that need to be cleared before year-endPuts the deadline right up against Christmas. Few things help beat back dug-in opposition than missing the holidays/vacation plans. Trump told reporters this weekend he was open to as much as a two-week extension so we'll see where this ends up in the next 24 hours.  As one GOP aide put it on Sunday: "Not sure what two more weeks gives us at this point except for more time to disagree. Something else needs to change the dynamic." The point here is this: things at this moment are headed towards a shutdown and the broader concern is if a shutdown occurs nobody is exactly sure how anyone would get out of it before the new Congress. Yes people involved in these talks say they are actively considering the possibility that this doesn't get solved until after the New Year. Senate Republican chiefs of staff were informed by leadership Friday before Bush's death that they should prepare their bosses to stay in Washington well into December several told CNN.For perspectiveKeep in mind nearly 75% of the government is funded through September 2019 including key priority agencies like the Pentagon Health Labor and Education. This will not be a massively disruptive shutdown.But keep in mind just because a shutdown wouldn't be as disruptive as those in the past doesn't mean lawmakers on the Hill want to do it. In fact even hardline House Republicans have floated to leaders pushing off the funding fight until early next year according to sources. Lawmakers don't want to spend Christmas at work with one another away from their families. Now if they can just get the President to agree to that...The tried-and-true escape hatchWhen in doubt lawmakers can always just pass a stop-gap bill to get them beyond the holidays or beyond the first few months of the year. Democrats are opposed to anything that doesn't reach until the end of the fiscal year -- they want the decks clear for the new House majority. And nobody thinks the President would sign one either. But when things get particularly bad never forget that this is the escape hatch that has worked for years -- so long as everyone agrees (or has just gotten too tired of one another). Where the players standTrumpPeople who have spoken to the President in recent days about this say they have picked up no hint that he's willing to back down on his request for $5 billion in border wall money. His view as repeatedly stated publicly and on Twitter is that the fight is beneficial for him -- even if his allies on Capitol Hill don't really want it to a lead to a government shutdown. In other words if Trump is going to come off his position he hasn't signaled it yet the people said. Senate RepublicansRepublicans have to some degree found themselves playing middle man between the White House and Democrats attempting to find some way to thread the needle between the two sides who are currently separated by about $3.4 billion. Republicans pitched -- and sources say the President reluctantly signed off to Senate Majority Leader McConnell -- on advanced appropriations or guaranteed border funding spread over a two-year period. But that hasn't brought them closer to a deal. Senate Democrats: Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took to the floor last week to offer Trump two options: 1. The bipartisan Senate-passed Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill which includes $1.6 billion for border security.2. Fund DHS with a continuing resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year. Neither of those will fly Republican aides say and Democrats generally know that so don't consider it a final offer.But the position is based on this: The $1.6 billion number was what the White House originally requested. It was agreed upon -- and passed -- by the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Add that to the fact that a good portion of the $1.3 billion in border security approved earlier this year has not been spent and Democrats say they don't understand why they should be the ones moving anywhere in this negotiation.House Republicans: The House GOP position has remained the same -- even in the wake of the midterm shellacking they passed a DHS funding bill with $5 billion for border security. That's their number and they are sticking to it. Here's the reality there: the House Republican conference is Trump's conference. Leaders have made clear their rank and file have no desire to split with the President on the topline number. And some have acknowledged it wouldn't be a bad thing if this all didn't get resolved until Democrats were back in control in the House.House Democrats  Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi repeatedly told CNN's Ashley Killough on Friday that there could not be a shutdown and that Democrats "don't believe in shutdowns." Pelosi's caucus and her place atop it remains somewhat of an open question as they pertain to the spending negotiations people involved say. Democrats as they often have while they've been in the minority will be needed to get any final spending package over the finish line. How many can be delivered for border funding of any kind? ,U.S.
 (CNN)The top admiral overseeing US Naval forces in the Middle East Vice Adm. Scott Stearney was found dead in his residence in Bahrain on Saturday the Navy said in a statement.While his death is being investigated officials say there is no evidence of foul play at this time."This is devastating news for the Stearney family for the team at Fifth Fleet and for the entire Navy" Adm. John Richardson the chief of naval operations told CNN Saturday. "Adm. Stearney was a decorated professional and a devoted father a devoted husband and a good friend.""I'd just ask that everybody keep the Stearney family in their thoughts and prayers as they move through this and also maybe to respect their privacy as they navigate these very very difficult waters" he added.Richardson said the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Bahraini Ministry of Interior are cooperating in the investigation. He added that he was unaware of any investigations into Stearney.The US Navy's Bahrain-based Naval Forces Central Command which the Fifth Fleet is part of oversees operations in areas like the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The command is seen as critical to US security interests given the challenges of Iran and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen both of which the US sees as potential threats to shipping in the region.A tremendous amount of commercial shipping including large amounts of oil and gas travels through the waters overseen by Fifth Fleet.The deputy commander of the Fifth Fleet Rear Adm. Paul Schlise has assumed acting command Richardson said adding that the Navy's "operations and responsibilities" in the region will continue uninterrupted.Richardson announced that Vice Adm. Jim Malloy the deputy chief of naval operations for operations plans and strategy will fly out to the region Saturday to take interim command until a permanent successor is chosen a clear signal as to how critical the Navy views the region.Stearney a native of Chicago graduated from Notre Dame in 1982 before being commissioned as an officer in the Navy and later served as an F/A-18 strike fighter pilot.Prior to taking command of Fifth Fleet in May he held several senior posts including commanding a carrier strike group and serving as director of operations for US Central Command.,U.S.
 (CNN)When Bill Clinton entered the White House he found a letter from the man he beat: George H.W. Bush. Notes from outgoing presidents to incoming ones are a tradition but Bush's letter on January 20 1993 is a lesson on grace in defeat. "He made us feel at home as much as he could. Total class" Clinton said of the letter.  Here's the full text of the letter:Dear BillWhen I walked into this office just now I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that too.I wish you great happiness here. I never felt the loneliness some Presidents have described.There will be very tough times made even more difficult by criticism you may not think is fair. I'm not a very good one to give advice; but just don't let the critics discourage you or push you off course.You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well.Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you.Good luck—GeorgeOnce political rivals Presidents Bush and Clinton ended up forming an unlikely friendship."Just because you run against someone does not mean you have to be enemies" Bush once said. "Politics does not have to be mean and ugly."Bush lived by that quote former Secretary of State Colin Powell told CNN. "I wish we could get some of that back in our system now" said Powell.In his statement after Bush's death Clinton recounted the friendship between the two. "I will be forever grateful for the friendship we formed" Clinton wrote. "From the moment I met him as a young governor invited to his home in Kennebunkport I was struck by the kindness he showed to Chelsea by his innate and genuine decency and by his devotion to Barbara his children and their growing brood."

New York (CNN Business)If you've stayed at a Starwood hotel in recent years there's a good chance you've been impacted by a massive data breach that potentially exposed the personal data of about 500 million guests. Marriott — which owns Starwood hotels such as the St. Regis and the Westin — on Friday disclosed that the Starwood guest reservation system had been hacked in a breach dating back to 2014. For 327 million people Marriott says the exposed information includes names phone numbers email addresses passport numbers and dates of birth. For millions of others credit card numbers and card expiration dates were potentially compromised. This kind of information could be used to steal your identity and open bank accounts credit cards or loans in your name.It's the second biggest corporate data breach in history behind one involving Yahoo which said last year that 3 billion accounts among several of its brands were compromised.Marriott said it will start emailing users who were impacted and it has set up a website with information about the breach. In the meantime here's what you can do to protect yourself:Change your passwordMarriott says guests should change their passwords regularly and pick ones that aren't easily guessed. For example instead of a common phrase choose a combination of four or more unrelated words with numbers characters and a mix of upper and lower-case letters. You should also have different passwords for all the services you use. "Changing your password will just add one more roadblock to a potential hacker getting into your system" said Aaron Brantly a cybersecurity expert at Virginia Tech.Many websites including social media and financial accounts offer two-factor authentication for an added layer of security. Even if someone obtains your password you can't access your accounts without a second piece of information like a code texted to your phone.Monitor your accounts for suspicious activityMarriott recommends customers keep an eye on their Starwood Preferred Guest account for any suspicious activity. Guests should also check their bank retirement and brokerage accounts as well as credit card statements to look for any unauthorized transactions. Some experts recommend signing up for credit monitoring services or identity theft protection. A more extreme step is putting a freeze on your credit which blocks anyone from accessing your credit reports without permission."Unfortunately the reality is [these consumers] have to monitor continuously for generally the rest of their lives" said Brantly. "These types of accounts are sold regularly on the dark web. ... You can usually buy credit card information for a couple dollars per credit card online."Vivek Lakshman VP of innovation at cybersecurity firm ThumbSignIn says consumers can also enroll in services like WebWatcher -- which Marriott is providing for free for a year --  to track their exposure. These sites monitor websites where personal information is shared and alerts consumers if there's evidence of their information exposed online. Open a separate credit card for online transactionsYair Levy a cybersecurity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University recommends having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track transactions and spot fraudulent activity.If that credit card is compromised you also won't have to update automatic payments for things like bills. Limit the information you shareExperts say not to provide information unless it's absolutely required to buy a product or service. "Consumers should limit what they provide companies based on their need to know. Often companies gather data that they may not need but take if volunteered" said Marty Puranik the CEO of Atlantic.Net a cloud computing and hosting services provider.For example a travel company may ask for passport information but it may not be required. If it is you can ask what other forms of identification you can provide instead."If you give lower level information or information that can be changed -- for example a second credit card to verify your identity -- it is easier to change and protect that than a social security number or passport ID" he said. But this isn't always possible. If you are traveling internationally a company like Marriott may require a passport number. Avoid saving credit card information on websitesExperts recommend minimizing the number of places where you store credit card information. However this doesn't mean your data will be safe or protected -- it just helps cut down on the risk.Another option is to use services such as PayPal Google Pay or Apple Pay which let you pay for goods and services without divulging your credit card to the company you're buying from.Be vigilant Consumers should work under the assumption cyber criminals already have access to their information as breaches become increasingly common. "Having a very healthy dose of skepticism moving forward is probably the best way to safeguard yourself in an era where all your information has been divulged unfortunately" said Brantly.Experts caution internet users to be wary of "phishing" attempts by bad actors looking to steal your data including through bogus emails fake links and fraudulent websites. On its informational website about the hack Marriott reminded members the company will not ask you to provide your password by phone or email. "Know you are consistently being exposed [and] consistently under threat -- not necessarily through any fault of your own but accidental disclosures by companies or carelessness by companies. It requires us in the modern era to be vigilant consistently" said Brantly. CNN's Jordan Valinsky contributed reporting,U.S.
When Jonathan Neman Nathaniel Ru and Nicolas Jammet met as freshman at Georgetown University 15 years ago they bonded over food.But it wasn't about their favorite pizza or cereal. They yearned for healthy affordable meals they could get on the go."It was this nagging question that we constantly had 'Where do we eat where do we eat?'" recalls Neman. "We wanted a place that was healthy delicious affordable convenient and fit our lifestyle and our values. [We] couldn't find it."In August 2007 a few months after they graduated the three decided to fill that void by opening Sweetgreen a quick-service restaurant serving healthy salads and meals in a bowl. Rethinking fast foodThe young entrepreneurs had a very specific vision for their restaurant: while they liked the "fast" and "cheap" attributes of fast food they didn't want to compromise on quality or the in-store experience."We wanted to create a fast food restaurant that kind of rejected all of the norms of fast food" says Neman.Sweetgreen for example sources ingredients directly from farmers."We now have over 300 farms that we work directly with" says Neman. "We have a different supply chain in every market that we're in."And all of the food is prepared "from scratch" every day in every restaurant he says. "From all of our lettuce that is brought in washed chopped all of our dressings that are made from scratch. Our falafel is made from scratch with whole chickpeas" said Neman. "I mean every single thing. We're grating fresh ginger all of those things. And you can taste it."Tying it all together is the service."Most fast casual restaurants use an assembly line process where you kind of come in and you go down an assembly line talking to probably four or five different employees along the way" says Neman. "We made it one-to-one where one team member is making your meal."  While the restaurants have proven to be wildly popular finding the money to get Sweetgreen off the ground was a struggle at first."We met with over 100 potential investors and ended up finding 40 people who agreed to invest in us" says Neman. But the average investment was less than $10000. "It was really people that believed in our mission and took a bet on us. Sweetgreen's first location in Washington DC was a small 600-square-foot space across the street from campus that was formerly a tavern. Now 11 years later Sweetgreen boasts 90 restaurants and employs 4000 workers across the United States.Earlier this month Sweetgreen scored $200 million in funding from Fidelity Investments bringing the total amount of outside funding it has raised to $365 million. With this latest round the company says Sweetgreen's valuation is now more than $1 billion. Starting Sweetgreen was in their genesFor the three men choosing to start their own business was almost a foregone conclusion."All of our parents are entrepreneurs so it was really in our DNA from the beginning to start something" says Ru who serves as Sweetgreen's chief brand officer."I think it really gave me and all of us the permission and freedom to take a risk" he says. It also gave them access to immediate feedback and in-house advisers. Ru's father had a distinct reaction to their business plan for instance. "I pitched him the idea and there's just silence" says Ru. "All I hear on the other end of the phone is 'Nathan that salad dressing better be damn good."Jammet's parents were in the food business and operated a few restaurants. "Nick's mom has been a huge inspiration and mentor to us really teaching us a lot about hospitality service culture and really creating community around that" says Neman.The founders want to keep investing in the company in order to improve their supply chain and enhance the customer experience with better technology (almost 50% of customer orders come through its app or online platforms). As part of those efforts the company launched a pilot program in September to test food delivery at offices.They also want to contribute to the community. One way Sweetgreen is doing this is by helping schools reimagine the quality of food served in their cafeterias. The company runs a series of wellness workshops each year involving more than 1000 students across DC Maryland Virginia and New York City. "For us as founders success is making an impact. We want to continue to build a business that can do that" says Ru. "We want to be the food brand of the next generation. We want to be synonymous with real food and making fast food and demystifying fast food.",U.S.
 (CNN)The family of a young woman who struggled with opioid addiction and whose moving obituary went viral is suing a Massachusetts city and police department for information about the woman's medical care in the days before her death.Madelyn Linsenmeir a 30-year-old Vermont mother died after she was arrested in September by Springfield police on outstanding warrants and providing a false name according to a police arrest log. The ACLU of Massachusetts is suing the city and its police department on behalf of Linsenmeir's family asking for documents and recordings related to her arrest detention and death. "Our family is heartbroken to have lost our beloved Madelyn" the family said according to the ACLU. Springfield Police Department spokesman Ryan Walsh and city Deputy Communications Director Darryl Moss told CNN the department is investigating the matter but had no comment on the lawsuit.Ominous text messagesThe lawsuit shares text messages between Linsenmeir and her family on September 28 showing the state of her health just before her arrest. "I need to go to the hospital I am dying i weigh 90 pounds" she texted Maureen Linsenmeir. "mom I need you."Later that day she texted her sister. "I just need to get help go to the hospital." The lawsuit alleges that at the time of her arrest Linsenmeir was allowed to call her mother with a Springfield police officer on the line. The suit alleges that Madelyn Linsenmeir was distraught and told her mother that she was not receiving medical attention. "As the conversation progressed the police officer refused to provide medical attention and even made a sarcastic comment to Maureen (Madelyn's mother) after Maureen expressed concern that Madelyn was being denied care" the complaint claims. The ACLU is looking to obtain a possible recording of this conversation as well as other requested information and documents police have not turned over.Linsenmeir was arrested September 29 and transferred to a women's correctional facility the next morning Walsh confirmed to CNN.On October 4 Linsenmeir was taken by ambulance to the Baystate Medical Center where she was admitted to the intensive care unit. On October 7 Linsenmeir died at the hospital still technically in police custody and surrounded by family.The woman's correctional facility was operated by the Hampden County Sheriff's Department. Shortly after her death Hampden County Sheriff Nicholas Cocchi told CNN in a statement that he was saddened by her death and wanted to "extend my sympathies to her family." He added that she was "under the evaluation and supervision of our correctional and medical team." The department was not named in the suit and had no further comment.'What about the rest of the victims'Around the world news outlets wrote about the powerful obituary crafted by her sister Kate O'Neill.Her obituary was shared on Facebook and her sister asked supporters to donate money to the treatment center she had turned to for help. In her Vermont hometown Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo posted on Facebook in October after seeing reactions to her obituary saying Linsenmeir's addiction and death were being treated as though nothing like this had happened before."Did readers think this was the first time a beautiful young beloved mother from a pastoral state got addicted to Oxy and died from the descent it wrought?" he wrote. "And what about the rest of the victims who weren't as beautiful and lived in downtrodden cities or the rust belt? They too had mothers who cried for them and blamed themselves."Del Pozo wrote that he was tired of arguing with sheriffs at national conferences about their deputies having to carry naloxone the opioid antagonist that can save people who are overdosing. "Maddie's gone. She can't feel your sorrow. But others are next" del Pozo wrote. "They are all human beings and they need our help. Go. Get to work."One of Linsenmeir's last public posts on her Facebook page is a black and white selfie taken in the car from August. "Enjoying this beautiful day" she wrote. Below the photo are comments from across the country. Some share stories of loved ones who died after struggling with opioid addictions and others simply leave kind messages. On his Facebook page del Pozo's final line to those who were moved by Linsenmeir's obituary: "We still need to earn the feelings her obituary inspired in us. We should have felt them years ago." ,U.S.
 (CNN)A woman trying to help what she thought was a needy mother and her baby has been fatally stabbed in Baltimore. The good Samaritan was identified by police as 52-year-old Jacquelyn Smith who was riding in a car with relatives Saturday when they saw a woman carrying what appeared to be a baby.The woman was holding a sign that read "Please Help me feed my Baby."Suspect said thank you before stabbing victim Smith of Aberdeen Maryland handed money out the car window to the woman when a man approached the vehicle. Baltimore Police said in a statement he first thanked the family for the money but then tried to grab Smith's wallet."A struggle ensued" police said and the man stabbed Smith in the torso before running away with the woman who had the sign. Smith died shortly after arriving at the hospital police told CNN. 'It makes it very difficult to help'Baltimore City District 12 Councilman Robert Stokes has spent his whole life in in East Baltimore where the homicide occurred. "It makes you wonder now if you want to roll your window down and help. It makes it hard and makes it more dangerous for people who really want to help people. It's a sad day and my condolences go out to the family" he said. "With the holidays coming up people want to help in some kind of way and it makes it very difficult to help."Police are searching for both the suspect described as a man in his 30s with a goatee and the woman with the sign who was asking for money. It's not clear if they have a baby with them. "We just gotta do something about the panhandling on the corner because if it's getting to this point it's dangerous" Stokes said. "Someone's life was taken away from them when they were trying to help.",U.S.
Washington (CNN)Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday made clear there's only one person leading trade negotiations with China: President Donald Trump. "It's clear that President Trump is going to be the one who leads the negotiations and the team will be an inclusive team" said Mnuchin during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box." Mnuchin's message was echoed by the President himself who boasted on Twitter about his relationship with his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping while his Treasury secretary was still speaking on television."He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!" Trump tweeted. Over the weekend the leaders of the world's largest trading partners struck a temporary truce with Trump agreeing to maintain the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and not raise them to 25% "at this time" ahead of a January 1 deadline.In exchange China agreed it was willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance -- an achievement Trump also touted on Twitter saying "Farmers I LOVE YOU!" It will now be up to US and Chinese negotiators to craft a deal with "real agreement" on "specific action items and deliverables and timeframes" said Mnuchin in the interview.Trump has fostered rivalries among his closest advisers on China pitting former Wall Streeters such as Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow against China hawks such as Robert Lighthizer the US trade representative and Peter Navarro a former economics professor who is now Trump's China trade adviser.In an early morning interview on National Public Radio Navarro -- who has clashed with his White House colleagues on how the US should proceed in its negotiations with China -- suggested that Lighthizer would be overseeing negotiations. The internal divisions among top White House aides have complicated negotiations with the Chinese. Yet Mnuchin reiterated that the Trump administration was committed to reaching a resolution."This is not going to be something where there is soft commitments that get kicked down the road" Mnuchin said on CNBC. He described the President's discussion with Xi as "very very specific." Mnuchin told reporters at the White House that both leaders -- Trump and Xi -- have extended invitations to their respective countries but no specific time or date has been set for the next round of talks. "My expectation is that with all these issues they will be meeting in the near future" he said. Mnuchin added that there would be changes to the US agricultural sector "right away" a signal to US soybean farmers who have been the first to feel pain from Chinese retaliation. The Treasury secretary said on CNBC that the Chinese government had made $1.2 trillion in additional commitments to buy US goods including on agriculture. He also said there would be an "immediate focus on reducing auto tariffs" after the President announced China would be willing to "reduce and remove" levies on US automakers from 40%. Trump didn't specify when the change would happen or what the new tariff level would be.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to comment Monday on Trump's statement referring questions to "the relevant authorities."Ahead of this weekend's meeting the President had directed his top trade negotiator to "examine all tools" available to address significantly higher tariffs imposed by China on US automakers. The secretary said there were several meetings in advance of the leaders' meeting in Buenos Aires and no decisions were made until the two presidents met over a steak dinner. Mnuchin signaled there was a big difference in tone on Saturday with a "very genuine offer" by Xi to Trump. The President described the meeting as "extraordinary" and as a "BIG leap forward" in US-China relations in another tweet earlier Monday morning. The Treasury secretary also added pressure on Chinese negotiators to keep their promises to the American President noting that Trump has ample "tools in the toolbox" to escalate tariffs on Beijing if talks don't proceed as planned.  "I'm taking President Xi at his word on his commitment to President Trump but they have to deliver on this" Mnuchin told reporters. "The President has been clear he expects to move forward but he has reserved the ability to do additional tariffs if they're not successful." The secretary offered some buffer for negotiators on what could be achievable over the next 90 days saying not every single one of the 142 items on the list would need to be completed noting there could be a "phased-in approach."

 (CNN)Former President George H.W. Bush will be eulogized by his son former President George W. Bush along with a mix of family and friends on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral the most high-profile event in a week of proceedings that will remember the remarkable life of the president who died on Friday at 94.Along with his son George H.W. Bush will be eulogized by former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney whose time in power overlapped with Bush former US Sen. Alan Simpson who became a close friend to Bush and presidential historian Jon Meacham the late president's biographer.President Donald Trump will not speak at the funeral sources with knowledge of the plans tell CNN but has said that he will attend Wednesday's memorial. Despite the fact that Trump's rise to power included lambasting past presidents including both Bushes the President has responded to Bush's death with repeated laudatory comments.The plans for Bush's funeral were all put into place before Trump was ever elected sources tell CNN. Presidents are traditionally asked to eulogize presidents who have died -- and in past state events like this that has been the case -- but the Bush family is unlike any other and has another president in the family who will fill that role. Trump will pay a condolence call to the Bush family on Tuesday at Blair House according to the sources a government house across the street from the White House.As of Monday morning all living Presidents are expected to attend Bush's funeral on Wednesday at the Washington National Cathedral.Presidents Donald Trump Barack Obama George W. Bush Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are all expected to attend the service according to sources familiar with the planning of the funeral. The current and all former first ladies are also expected to attend except for Rosalynn Carter according to the sources.Former Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will also attend the funeral an aide to Biden confirms.Bush's passing has led to an outpouring of remembrances for the humble and gentlemanly statesman whose life and service was seen to stand in direct contrast to the vitriol and partisanship that has enveloped elected politics in recent years. Many have also heralded Bush's 73-year marriage to his wife Barbara Bush who died months before her husband in April 2018.Those reflections will continue throughout the week when Bush's casket travels from Houston Bush's hometown to Washington DC to lie in state in the United States Capitol. Trump directed the presidential plane -- called Air Force One when the sitting President is aboard -- to pick up Bush's casket and transport it to Washington."We'll be spending three days of mourning and three days of celebrating a really great man's life" Trump said in Argentina where he was attending the G20 summit. "So we look forward to doing that and he certainly deserves it. He really does. He was a very special person."Bush will lie in state until Wednesday morning when his casket will then be transported to the National Cathedral for the first of two funeral services for the former president.Vice President Mike Pence will offer brief remarks Monday at the evening ceremony at the Capitol before the public can visit the president lying in state. It is anticipated that foreign leaders will also be paying condolence calls to the family on Tuesday.The German government press service announced Monday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will fly to Washington DC to take part in the memorial service for the late president who oversaw the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany.On Thursday Bush's casket will travel back to Houston where he will be memorialized at St. Martin's Episcopal Church and eulogized by his grandson Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush and former Secretary of State James Baker a man who has been by Bush's side since the former president's failed 1970 Senate campaign in Texas.Members of the family including children and grandchildren will be taking part in each service. Bush's personal relationship with his Secret Service details will also be on full display throughout the week of events. The detail made up of agents who enjoyed a close relationship with the former President will be with him until he is interred and in the second vehicle in the motorcades that will lead to all the ceremonies.Some of the agents will also act as honorary pallbearers in Texas at the funeral home and Ellington Field where Bush will begin his final flight back to Washington DC.The honorary pallbearers in Washington -- for both Bush's entry into the Rotunda and the National Cathedral -- will be Navy captains and admirals who have commanded the USS George H.W. Bush and members of the carrier strike group.Bush's death has also led to a series of symbolic moments.Bush had come to be known in recent years for his colorful and symbolic use of socks wearing different pairs to express his mood or mark occasions. Jim McGrath Bush's spokesman tweeted on Monday that the 41st President "will be carried to his final rest wearing socks that pay tribute to his lifetime of service starting as an 18 year-old naval aviator in war."McGrath also tweeted a photo of Sully Bush's service dog laying in front of the late President's casket on Sunday night with the caption "Mission Complete."Sully is named after former airline pilot Chesley B. "Sully" Sullenberger III who became famous for landing a damaged passenger jet on the Hudson River and saving all 155 passengers and crew in 2009. Following the week of services Bush will be laid to rest on his presidential library grounds at Texas A&M University where his wife and Robin his daughter who died of leukemia in 1953 are buried.,U.S.
 (CNN)Bruce Springsteen isn't a big fan of President Donald Trump."He's deeply damaged at his core" the New Jersey-born rocker recently told Esquire magazine. "Anyone in that position who doesn't deeply feel those ties that bind is a dangerous man and it's very pitiful."That's no big surprise. Springsteen is an outspoken liberal; he campaigned for John Kerry in 2004 and performed at Barack Obama's second inauguration. What IS a big surprise is what Springsteen told the Sunday Times in an interview in advance of the release later this month of his long-running Broadway show on Netflix."I don't see anyone out there at the moment ... the man who can beat Trump or the woman who can beat Trump" Springsteen said of the potential 2020 Democratic field. "You need someone who can speak some of the same language [as Trump] ... and the Democrats don't have an obvious effective presidential candidate."Which is an interesting analysis -- particularly when you consider that the Democratic field is likely to be the largest in modern American history with two dozen (or more) candidates expected to run. One would think that given the expected size of the field there would be at least one candidate -- and maybe a few -- who Springsteen believes can take on and beat Trump.And Springsteen's specific doubt about the Democratic field -- "you need someone who can speak some of the same language" as the President -- is a very important one. Dismiss Springsteen as just another liberal rock star if you will (and he is!) but also remember that Springsteen's roots are in a working-class blue-collar community -- and that he has spent his entire life writing about and trying to explain the hopes fears and anxieties of those communities to the country and the world.Trump spoke to those fears and hopes in a very direct and real way during the 2016 campaign. He won the White House thanks to victories in the industrial Midwest -- Michigan Wisconsin and Ohio -- that was hit the hardest by the rapidly changing 21st-century economy and the crushing blows it dealt to the manufacturing sector. "Donald J. Trump won the presidency by riding an enormous wave of support among white working-class voters" concluded The New York Times' Nate Cohen the day after the 2016 election. Trump won white non-college educated males 71%-23% over Hillary Clinton and white non-college educated women 61% to 34% according to exit polling. Those white non-college educated voters comprised one-third of the overall electorate. ("Non-college educated" of course doesn't equal "blue-collar" but history has shown there are strong similarities among those groups and their voting preferences.)There is zero question -- particularly when you consider the crushing blow Democrats delivered to Republicans in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms -- that Trump's path to a second term relies heavily on these same blue collar whites who got him elected President in the first place. And like it or not Trump does as Springsteen notes understand how to not only talk to this group but convince them that he is their champion that he is a voice for the previously voiceless. This from Trump's inauguration speech captures that sentiment nicely:"January 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again."The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer."Everyone is listening to you now."You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before."Trump makes this appeal by casting himself as a man of the people -- fighting against elite snobbery and political correctness. (Yes I am well aware of the irony of a man born into wealth and raised in New York City emerging as the voice of the working class.)"Why are they elite?" Trump asked a crowd at a rally in Minnesota over the summer. "I have a much better apartment than they do. I'm smarter than they are. I became president and they didn't. And I'm representing the best people on earth the deplorables."Looking through that lens -- as Springsteen is doing -- you can understand the rocker's concerns. Kamala Harris the current frontrunner in the 2020 rankings I do with Harry Enten is a senator from California. Elizabeth Warren is an unapologetic liberal from Massachusetts. Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist from Vermont. None of that group has an obvious appeal to blue-collar white workers that would trump Trump's -- at least at first glance.That said I do think there are candidates in the field -- or potential field -- who would fit more of what Springsteen is looking for. Former Vice President Joe Biden has practically changed his middle name to "Hardscrabble roots in Scranton." And Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is the sort of gravel-voiced populist that might appeal to Bruce. Pete Buttigieg the former mayor of South Bend Indiana is not nearly as well known as Biden and Brown but has a similar pitch -- that Democrats need to start reaching Midwesterner voters especially white working class ones again.The question before Democrats to my mind is not whether they have a candidate -- or candidates -- who can fight Trump for white blue-collar voters in the Midwest by speaking some of the "same language" as Trump to borrow Springsteen's phrasing. The question is whether the party's base which is increasingly coastal non-white and liberal wants to even consider a candidate like that as the party's standard-bearer against Trump.If 2018 is any indication they don't. No matter what Springsteen thinks.,U.S.
 (CNN)North Carolina's election board voted again Friday to delay certification of the election results in the 9th Congressional District amid allegations of irregularities and possible criminal activity with absentee ballots a move that could potentially lead to a call for a new election.The 7-2 vote from the bipartisan board gives its lawyers and investigators less than a month to further examine allegations of improper activities that have been filed with the board at least one of which claims an unidentified woman filled out an absentee ballot for a voter.Should evidence be found of voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 905-vote margin between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready the board could potentially call for a new election.McCready conceded the race to Harris the day after the election earlier in November but the state Democratic Party has filed affidavits with the board of voters purporting there were potential illegal activities.One affidavit filed by the Democratic Party alleges Republican McCrae Dowless who has a history of being accused of improper voter activity in Bladen County could financially benefit from handling absentee ballots for the Harris campaign. Dowless is also alleged to have claimed he had 80 people working for him on two races including the 9th District. Another affidavit alleged Dowless said he'd receive a $40000 bonus if Harris won the election.CNN's attempts to reach Dowless for comment Friday were unsuccessful."I move that in light of claims of numerous irregularities and concerted fraudulent activities related to absentee by mail ballots and potentially other matters in Congressional District 9 the state board hold as then constituted an evidentiary hearing on or before December 21" Vice Chairman Joshua Malcolm proposed in the vote. "... To assure that the election is determined without taint or fraud or corruption and without irregularities that may have changed the result of the election."The board met Tuesday to certify results from the November 6 election. The 9th Congressional District was among the races the board unanimously voted not to certify then. As the board reconvened its open session Friday morning it immediately voted to adjourn to a closed session to consult with its legal counsel about potential criminal activities.The board reconvened publicly hours later and voted to withhold certification.Harris was one of two Republicans to beat incumbents during the GOP primaries this year. He beat three-term Rep. Robert Pittenger by 828 votes. Election watchers pointed to his substantial absentee lead back then in Bladen County where the investigation is currently focused.  "We applaud the board's bipartisan decision to delay certification and fully investigate the concerning allegations in the 9th Congressional District" said Wayne Goodwin chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. "North Carolina voters deserve to know the truth and their voices deserve to be heard."The state Republican Party called for the board chairman to be removed."The lack of information from shameless Democrat partisan NCSBE Chairman Andy Penry makes this entire debacle difficult to grasp" said Robin Hayes chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. Hayes pointed to an editorial in The Charlotte Observer and said "Every once in a blue moon we agree with The News & Observer's editorial board: Penry should resign.",U.S.

 (CNN)Administrators at the University of North Carolina are proposing a new $5.3 million building to safely house a controversial Confederate monument that was toppled by protesters in August.UNC Chancellor Carol Folt said that experts concluded that the rifle-carrying statue known as "Silent Sam" could not be returned to its previous home on campus because of public safety concerns. However the statue also cannot legally be moved to a museum mausoleum or cemetery because of a state law that prevents the removal of state monuments without the approval of the North Carolina Historical Commission.So the university plans to build a new indoor facility on campus to house Silent Sam Folt said on Monday. The new building at a proposed cost of $5.3 million will provide historical context for the statue and for the university's broader history."(We plan to) make it a truly strong interactive center that tells our full history of this university from before settlement to its emergence this day as one of the leading public state research universities in America" Folt said.The proposed solution takes a middle course in trying to appeal to the statue's opponents who say it glorified the Confederacy's support of  slavery while also accommodating those who see the statue as remembering a key part of the university's history.The facility and statue would be available to the public but with buffers and security around it to protect public safety Folt said. Several UNC officials said their first preference was to move the statue off campus but they were limited by state law.A summary of the proposal was sent to the Board of Governors and a report with more specifics will be made public Folt said.Statue honored the ConfederacyIn August on the eve of the first day of classes a group of protesters knocked over the controversial statue. Chancellor Folt called the protest "unlawful and dangerous" but acknowledged that the statue was a longstanding source of division for students staff and alumni alike."The monument has been divisive for years and its presence has been a source of frustration for many people not only on our campus but throughout the community" she said.Silent Sam was dedicated in 1913 -- its construction at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy -- to remember the "sons of the University who died for their beloved Southland 1861-1865" says UNC's website.At its dedication Confederate veteran Julian Shakespeare Carr praised the Confederate army for "sav[ing] the very life of the Anglo Saxon race in the South" according to the university's archives.The monument which was first called "Silent Sam" in 1954 by campus newspaper The Daily Tar Heel faced only occasional protests and defacing over the years. In an attempt to add context a monument to slaves -- called the Unsung Founders Memorial -- was dedicated 100 feet away in 2005.Campaigns to remove Confederate monuments from public property gained traction after the 2015 murder of nine African-Americans by a self-described white supremacist at a church in Charleston South Carolina.Since then Confederate statues monuments and flags have come down in North Carolina Tennessee Louisiana Maryland and elsewhere."This is part of a much bigger cultural reckoning but one much rooted in the American South. We live in a culture and country that hasn't sufficiently reckoned with its darker history" said Cary Levine of the UNC faculty executive committee which moderated a dozen workshops on the statue's future.Intense debate over its place on campusThe future of Silent Sam had been a topic of discussion for months among the university's students staff faculty and the wider Chapel Hill community.The university's Student Government Association has called for the statue to be moved to another site on campus. The SGA said it should be put "in a museum or library collection while making it clear that we do not glorify our violent past."Students also had suggested adding "contextualization" -- or proper historical perspective -- or putting up another sculpture to replace Silent Sam said Emily Blackburn undergraduate student body vice president and chair of a student advisory committee."Those most outspoken about the issue I would say they're in favor of contextualization" Blackburn said. "I think that's what it all boils down to no matter your thoughts on the statue itself."A letter in The Daily Tar Heel signed by 54 African-American members of UNC's faculty took a harder line."There is no way to re-erect the statue without valorizing an incomplete version of history" the letter read. "A symbol of racism violence and white supremacy has no place on our 21st century campus often called the 'University of the People.'",U.S.
Washington  (CNN)Former first lady Michelle Obama reportedly offered a pointed opinion of work-life balance and marriage equality for women saying that the idea that women can have it all is untrue because "that s--- doesn't work all the time.""Marriage still ain't equal y'all" Obama said to a crowd gathered in Brooklyn on Saturday for a leg of her international book tour several news outlets reported. "It ain't equal. I tell women that whole 'you can have it all' -- mmm nope not at the same time that's a lie. It's not always enough to lean in because that s--- doesn't work all the time."The former first lady appears to have been disagreeing with a feminist philosophy shared by Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg in her book "Lean In: Women Work and the Will to Lead" which encourages women to be more ambitious.According to reports Obama quickly apologized for using the expletive telling the crowd: "I thought we were at home y'all. I was getting real comfortable up in here. All right I'm back now. Sometimes that stuff doesn't work.",U.S.
Washington (CNN)Speaking at a "Becoming" tour stop for her best-selling memoir at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Saturday Michelle Obama used language we're not used to hearing from a former first lady.Obama said the idea that "you can have it all" is "a lie." "It's not always enough to lean in" she said referencing Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's book of the same name. "Because that s--- doesn't work all the time." She then apologized for her language. "I forgot where I was for a moment."Obama's not alone. If it seems like politicians' language has become more salty lately well dagnabbit you're right.The rate at which politicians in Congress and state legislatures use expletives on social media has risen dramatically according to data from GovPredict an analytics firm. In 2014  the firm tracked 83 instances of lawmakers using profane words. Over the next two years usage rose slowly but in 2017 -- the year President Donald Trump took office -- it exploded with 1571 instances. So far this year there have been 2409 instances.The firm tracked 10 words ranging in levels of offensiveness from "crap" to words that are not fit to print in a family newspaper. The word "sh*t" or a variation of it is the most-used expletive and it saw its biggest spike after Trump used the phrase "sh*thole countries" to describe Haiti and countries in Africa.Before Trump's comment made in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers to describe countries immigrants came from it had been used seven times. Since it's been used 480 times. The word has seen a 117% spike in usage in 2018 compared with 2017 the largest jump of any word on GovPredict's list.Expletives are sometimes used for emphasis. In his Senate concession speech in El Paso Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke dropped an f-bomb to describe how proud he was of the people who worked on his campaign.Politicians also use profanity to express a heightened level of outrage and draw attention to something. That's what happened after Trump said the US stood with Saudi Arabia despite the fact US intelligence found Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a columnist for The Washington Post. "Hey @realdonaldtrump: being Saudi Arabia's bitch is not 'America First' " Rep. Tulsi Gabbard a Hawaii Democrat and Iraq War veteran tweeted last week. It's been retweeted more than 38000 times and liked more than 134000 times far more than any of her other tweets this month.Federal legislators are more likely to have used profanity online with 34% of senators or House members using it compared with 16% of state lawmakers.Sen. Bernie Sanders a Vermont independent leads Congress with 41 uses of profanity. He's followed in the Senate by Montana Democrat Jon Tester with seven; Kentucky Republican Rand Paul with six; and New Jersey Democrat Bob Menendez with six. In the House Missouri Democrat Lacy Clay leads with 37.But the politician with the most colorful Twitter feed is Sherry Frost a Democrat in New Hampshire's state House who has used words from the list 415 times since 2014."I'm an English teacher and my philosophy is these words exist for a reason" Frost told Cover/Line. "Invective is a way we make important points."She's dropped the f-bomb when telling her followers to vote and added "Damn" when she retweeted a statistic about how slowly the minimum wage in Texas had grown compared with the cost of college.Frost said she has some constituents who appreciate her language. And to those who don't she said if they're more offended by the language she uses than what she's using it to draw attention to "then you're part of the problem.""I have a lot of people who are grateful for me for not being polite" she said.,U.S.
Washington (CNN)A fourth US service member has died from wounds sustained in an attack with an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan last week the Pentagon announced Monday. Army Sgt. Jason Mitchell McClary 24 from Export Pennsylvania died December 2 in Landstuhl Germany where he was being treated following the attack on November 27. Three others Army Capt. Andrew Patrick Ross Army Sgt. 1st Class Eric Michael Emond and Air Force Staff Sgt. Dylan J. Elchin were killed when their vehicle was struck by the improvised explosive device near the city of Ghazni Afghanistan.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack the deadliest against US service members in Afghanistan in years.McClary was assigned to 1st Battalion 38th Infantry Regiment 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team 4th Infantry Division Fort Carson Colorado.  The incident is still under investigation.In recent weeks the Taliban have been resurgent near Ghazni prompting the US to send additional troops into the region to help Afghan forces. US Gen. Scott Miller the head of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan was photographed earlier this month carrying a fully loaded M4 carbine assault rifle while visiting the Ghazni area.On Saturday the US military announced that a US airstrike killed a senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan's Helmand province."We can confirm a US airstrike conducted yesterday resulted in the death of Taliban shadow governor Mullah Manan" US Army Col.

Hong Kong (CNN)Stock markets across the world rose Monday after the United States and China agreed to a temporary truce in their trade war negotiated over dinner in Argentina on Saturday.But stark differences in the language used by Washington and Beijing in announcing the deal could spell trouble as both countries begin negotiations aimed at striking a permanent end to trade tensions.US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met for more than two hours on the sidelines of the G20 meeting after months of tough talk on trade and tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.Following the meeting both sides proclaimed the meeting a success with Trump pledging to pause the introduction of stricter trade measures ahead of further negotiations.But the language used in the Trump administration's announcement of the deal was very different to that in Chinese government statements especially on Beijing's promises to buy more US goods and the possibility of removing existing tariffs.Even the 90-day deadline set by the Trump administration was nowhere to be found in Chinese media coverage. Bonnie Glaser director of the CSIS China Power Project in Washington told CNN the disparity showed there was "a lot of room for misunderstanding" in the deal between Trump and Xi."I think that there's still enormous uncertainty about what the outcome of these negotiations will be" she said.90 day deadline?Before the meeting with Xi Trump had set a January 1 deadline for increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.Although talks appear to have gone well it wasn't clear from the resulting statements whether Beijing realized Trump's ultimatum wasn't canceled -- only postponed.According to a readout from the White House the two leaders agreed "that they will endeavor to have this transaction completed within the next 90 days.""If at the end of this period of time the parties are unable to reach an agreement the 10% tariffs will be raised to 25%" the White House statement said.But in Chinese coverage there was no mention of a deadline instead painting the news as a indefinite halt while negotiations continued."(Parties) agreed not to impose new additional tariffs" the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.'Substantial' new purchases?The actual substance of the deal was also very different depending on whose assessment you read. According to the US statement part of the deal to halt stricter tariffs was that the Chinese side would make unspecified but "very substantial" purchases of US goods immediately."(China will purchase) agricultural energy industrial and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between the two countries" Washington said. "China has agreed to start purchasing agricultural product from our farmers immediately."But again there was no reference to new purchases in Chinese statements which only reported that parties wanted to reach a "concrete deal that is mutually beneficial."Glaser said this omission was understandable in that "it's unlikely that Xi Jinping would want to tell his domestic audience that he was making concessions to the US." Qualcomm-NXP deal back on?It was the multibillion-dollar deal that Beijing kept in limbo before it finally fell apart in July.American chip maker Qualcomm wanted a merger with Dutch counterpart NXP an agreement worth $44 billion first announced in October 2016. But before it could go ahead there needed to be regulatory approval in nine jurisdictions including the European Union South Korea and critically China.Amid growing trade tensions Beijing allowed the clock to run out and Qualcomm announced the deal was off paying a $2 billion penalty.After the meeting between Trump and Xi however the White House said the deal could be back on. "President Xi also stated that he is open to approving the previously unapproved Qualcomm-NXP deal should it again be presented to him" the readout said.There was no mention of the promise in Chinese state media though. Qualcomm has yet to comment on the news.No end in sight?If Chinese statements are anything to go by Beijing is hoping this will be the beginning of the end for the Trump trade war."(Both leaders) instructed the economic teams of both sides to step up negotiations toward the removal of all additional tariffs and reach a concrete deal that is mutually beneficial and win-win" Xinhua said.Xi and his team were likely pushing hard for an end to the tariffs that some analysts have said are partly responsible for slowing China's economic growth and leading international businesses to consider pulling manufacturing out of the country."I think the Chinese are hoping that political and economic factors will converge to convince the Trump administration to lower the bar somewhat so that China can meet some of the requirements" Glaser said.But whether or not a complete end to tariffs was discussed in Argentina there was no hint of it in the White House statement.While he praised the meeting as "highly successful" and a "great honor" to be working with Xi Trump would only say that tariff increases are on hold for now.

 (CNN)Under a cloud of grief an aura of hope and unity prevailed at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Sunday night. In its first Hanukkah ceremony since 11 congregants were gunned down at the Pittsburgh synagogue a diverse crowd gathered to worship and show their support for the Jewish community.This Hanukkah will be "unforgettable" said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman of the New Light Congregation which worships at the synagogue. He told those gathered for the menorah-lighting event about the "terrible tragedy that occurred here at this building." The eleven victims were killed October 27 when a gunman made anti-Semitic comments while opening fire on the congregation a law enforcement official said. Suspect Robert Bowers has pleaded not guilty to 44 federal charges. Simcha and Chaya Teich came all the way from Brooklyn New York to support the synagogue on Sunday. "It's very nice to see all the different parts of the community band together and celebrate a Jewish holiday we all have in common" Chaya Teich told CNN affiliate KDKA. Simcha Teich noted the symbolism of the branches of the synagogue's menorah. "We can take a lesson that this is the Tree of Life Synagogue and the Menorah significantly has its branches that branch outwards not inwards" he told KDKA. "And so too the light of the Tree of Life is just like the Menorah where it branches outwards and it spreads its lights onto the people that flock to it."Pittsburgh police Detective Sgt. James Glick was selected to light the candle Sunday night on behalf of Pittsburgh police. He was assisted by survivors of the mass shooting. ,U.S.

 (CNN)The federal government is headed toward a partial shutdown if Republicans and Democrats in Congress can't resolve a standoff over President Donald Trump's demands to fund the border wall. Many government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security will run out of funding on December 7 if Congress does not act soon. There will almost certainly not be a shutdown this week on account of the death of former President George H.W. Bush. But according to multiple people involved consider this a brief respite from what looms ahead. The fight is still happening behind the scenes -- and will spill back into public next week. Talks between Republican and Democratic negotiators had more or less fallen apart on Friday and this weekend things haven't progressed toward a resolution at all according to several sources with direct knowledge of the talks. There now will likely be more time -- and with more time more opportunities to find a path forward. But as of Monday morning nobody in either party has a good sense of how -- or when -- this will end.As a practical matter with Bush to lie in state in the US Capitol Rotunda the bandwidth (and floor time) to move forward on a year-end funding package is limited. As a symbolic matter lawmakers wandering into yet another government shutdown this Congress is a fairly bad look given Bush's legacy as a man and president which will be remembered in detail after detail tribute after tribute all week.What to watch this weekWhen lawmakers act on a short-term stop-gap bill to give them more time before the funding deadline -- and for how long that bill extends the deadline.Days until the government shuts down: 5* (*Expect this to be extended.) The preferenceCongressional leadership spent the last 24 hours gauging the support for one- and two-week stopgap funding bills but even that has run into some issues sources say. Republicans are angling for a two-week extension while Democrats have signaled they would prefer a one-week extension.  The play for the two-week version per Republicans comes down to three fundamental reasons: More time to negotiate Opens up floor space for the raft of other must-pass legislative items that need to be cleared before year-endPuts the deadline right up against Christmas. Few things help beat back dug-in opposition than missing the holidays/vacation plans. Trump told reporters this weekend he was open to as much as a two-week extension so we'll see where this ends up in the next 24 hours.  As one GOP aide put it on Sunday: "Not sure what two more weeks gives us at this point except for more time to disagree. Something else needs to change the dynamic." The point here is this: things at this moment are headed towards a shutdown and the broader concern is if a shutdown occurs nobody is exactly sure how anyone would get out of it before the new Congress. Yes people involved in these talks say they are actively considering the possibility that this doesn't get solved until after the New Year. Senate Republican chiefs of staff were informed by leadership Friday before Bush's death that they should prepare their bosses to stay in Washington well into December several told CNN.For perspectiveKeep in mind nearly 75% of the government is funded through September 2019 including key priority agencies like the Pentagon Health Labor and Education. This will not be a massively disruptive shutdown.But keep in mind just because a shutdown wouldn't be as disruptive as those in the past doesn't mean lawmakers on the Hill want to do it. In fact even hardline House Republicans have floated to leaders pushing off the funding fight until early next year according to sources. Lawmakers don't want to spend Christmas at work with one another away from their families. Now if they can just get the President to agree to that...The tried-and-true escape hatchWhen in doubt lawmakers can always just pass a stop-gap bill to get them beyond the holidays or beyond the first few months of the year. Democrats are opposed to anything that doesn't reach until the end of the fiscal year -- they want the decks clear for the new House majority. And nobody thinks the President would sign one either. But when things get particularly bad never forget that this is the escape hatch that has worked for years -- so long as everyone agrees (or has just gotten too tired of one another). Where the players standTrumpPeople who have spoken to the President in recent days about this say they have picked up no hint that he's willing to back down on his request for $5 billion in border wall money. His view as repeatedly stated publicly and on Twitter is that the fight is beneficial for him -- even if his allies on Capitol Hill don't really want it to a lead to a government shutdown. In other words if Trump is going to come off his position he hasn't signaled it yet the people said. Senate RepublicansRepublicans have to some degree found themselves playing middle man between the White House and Democrats attempting to find some way to thread the needle between the two sides who are currently separated by about $3.4 billion. Republicans pitched -- and sources say the President reluctantly signed off to Senate Majority Leader McConnell -- on advanced appropriations or guaranteed border funding spread over a two-year period. But that hasn't brought them closer to a deal. Senate Democrats: Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer took to the floor last week to offer Trump two options: 1. The bipartisan Senate-passed Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill which includes $1.6 billion for border security.2. Fund DHS with a continuing resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year. Neither of those will fly Republican aides say and Democrats generally know that so don't consider it a final offer.But the position is based on this: The $1.6 billion number was what the White House originally requested. It was agreed upon -- and passed -- by the Senate on a bipartisan basis. Add that to the fact that a good portion of the $1.3 billion in border security approved earlier this year has not been spent and Democrats say they don't understand why they should be the ones moving anywhere in this negotiation.House Republicans: The House GOP position has remained the same -- even in the wake of the midterm shellacking they passed a DHS funding bill with $5 billion for border security. That's their number and they are sticking to it. Here's the reality there: the House Republican conference is Trump's conference. Leaders have made clear their rank and file have no desire to split with the President on the topline number. And some have acknowledged it wouldn't be a bad thing if this all didn't get resolved until Democrats were back in control in the House.House Democrats  Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi repeatedly told CNN's Ashley Killough on Friday that there could not be a shutdown and that Democrats "don't believe in shutdowns." Pelosi's caucus and her place atop it remains somewhat of an open question as they pertain to the spending negotiations people involved say. Democrats as they often have while they've been in the minority will be needed to get any final spending package over the finish line. How many can be delivered for border funding of any kind? ,U.S.

 (CNN)Instead of apple juice children at a Hawaii preschool were served Pine-Sol by mistake according to a Hawaii Department of Health report.A classroom assistant at Kilohana United Methodist Church in East Oahu was preparing a snack for the children and grabbed a bottle of the cleaning liquid from a clean-up cart in the kitchen on November 27. The assistant apparently mistook it for apple juice because of its similar color the school's director told the health department inspector.The teacher was helping students in the restroom when the assistant poured the Pine-Sol into cups in the classroom. The teacher  "smelled that it was not apple juice and stopped the students from drinking it" according to the report.The cleaning liquid was in the original Pine-Sol bottle with its label. The inspector noted that a rubbish can and other cleaning supplies were on the cart and no food items. CNN affiliate KHON reports that emergency medical services evaluated three students who took small sips of the cleaning liquid but none needed treatment.The assistant no longer works at the school KHON reports.CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report. ,U.S.

London (CNN)In his public writings Jamal Khashoggi's criticism of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was measured. In private the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back.In more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a "beast" a "pac-man" who would devour all in his path even his supporters.CNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz which include voice recordings photos and videos paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince."The more victims he eats the more he wants" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up. "I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on."The exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. "[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.But in August when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. "God help us" he wrote.Two months later he was dead.Abdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone. "The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal I am really sorry to say" Abdelaziz told CNN. "The guilt is killing me." SIM cards and financial supportAbdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.In almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018 Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340000-strong Twitter following.The digital offensive dubbed the "cyber bees" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution.  "We have no parliament; we just have Twitter" said Abdulaziz adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. "Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked we've been insulted we'd been threatened so many times and we decided to do something."The pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz Khashoggi pledged an initial $30000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.In one exchange dated May this year Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. "I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.""Brilliant report" Khashoggi replies. "I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something."A month later another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first $5000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up. But in early August he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi."How did they know?" asks Khashoggi in a message."There must have been a gap" says Abdulaziz. Three minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: "God help us."The 'hack'Abdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware.According to Bill Marczak a research fellow at the Citizen Lab the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government.Marczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia.Danna Ingleton an Amnesty deputy program director said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license Ingleton said.On Sunday Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. "NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents journalists and human rights activists" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna who is acting for Abdulaziz.The lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar.In a statement NSO Group says its technology helps governments fight crime and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government. "Our products have a long track record of assisting governments in preventing suicide bombers stopping drug lords and sex traffickers and helping safely return victims of kidnapping" the statement said."If there is suspicion of misuse we investigate it and take the appropriate actions including suspending or terminating a contract" it adds.  'Tyranny has no logic'The fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.The messages portray Khashoggi a Saudi former establishment figure becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power."He loves force oppression and needs to show them off" Khashoggi says of bin Salman "but tyranny has no logic."Such discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile they flitted back and forth between phone calls voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal.As Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top.'Message from MBS'Last May Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN.Speaking in Arabic the men referred to only as Abdullah and Malek tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed they say and wants to offer him a job."We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you" one of them says.Abdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff.Chillingly the men mention also Saud al Qathani bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder."If Saud al Qathani himself hears your name he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly" says one other man.Then they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork.Poignantly Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life."He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places."On October 2 Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages.,World
Madrid (CNN)A far-right party in Spain broke new political ground Sunday after winning 12 seats in a regional election for the first time since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.In another sign that the far-right is gaining momentum in Europe the Vox party gained its success in Andalucia an area in the south of the country which has suffered with high unemployment and is one of the flashpoints for the country's battle with illegal immigration.Its success was lauded by French far-right politician Marine Le Pen who tweeted: "Strong and warm congratulations to my friends from Vox who tonight in Spain scored a meaningful result for such a young and dynamic movement."Vox has attracted voters with its hard line stance on illegal immigration its opposition to Catalan independence and its calls for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain. It could now find itself in a position as kingmaker with the ruling Socialist party failing to secure enough seats to command a majority."We are the ones who will bring about change progress and the reconquest" Francisco Serrano Vox's candidate in Andalusia told a loud crowd gathered in Seville Reuters reported Sunday.The Socialists who won 33 seats said Vox's success should be viewed as "very serious.""This phenomenon we have seen in the rest of Europe and the world has now reached Spain and is entering the Andalusia parliament" Susana Diaz the Socialist candidate in the region told supporters according to Reuters.The results in Andalucia a region where the Socialist party has governed since the first post-Franco elections in 1982 are likely to spark fears that the far-right could gain further influence in a series of local and European elections in May 2019.Vox will now have to wait to find out whether it will be approached to be part of rightwing coalition that would be led by the conservative People's Party which came second.Its national leader Pablo Casado said it will hold talks with all the parties to the right of the Socialists Reuters reported.The result is also a setback for Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez who took office in June following a corruption scandal."My government will continue to push ahead with a pro-reform pro- European project" he tweeted on Monday."The results in Andalucía strengthen our compromise to defend the constitution and democracy against fear."Spain is not scheduled to hold a general election until 2020 though there is speculation the vote could be brought forward if Sanchez's minority government fail to pass a budget.CNN's James Masters wrote from London.

Dubai (CNN Business)OPEC is losing one of its oldest members.The small gas-rich state of Qatar said Monday that it will leave the oil cartel on January 1 after nearly 60 years. The country's state oil company Qatar Petroleum made the announcement in a series of tweets. "The withdrawal decision reflects Qatar's desire to focus its efforts on plans to develop and increase its natural gas production" Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi the country's newly-appointed minister of state for energy affairs was cited as saying in one of the tweets.Qatar has been under a diplomatic and economic embargo by its Arab neighbors including OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for the past 18 months. In response Qatar has been increasing gas production the mainstay of its economy. OPEC has no role in the global market for natural gas. And Qatar made no reference to the dispute with other Gulf states in its announcement emphasizing plans to cement its position as the world's leading supplier of gas. Its exports currently account for about 30% of global demand. "Achieving our ambitious growth strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar's position as the leading natural gas producer" Al-Kaabi said.Marginal OPEC producerQatar is a marginal player in OPEC when compared to some of the cartel's biggest producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq. It pumps about 600000 barrels of oil a day out of more than 27 million from all OPEC members.But the surprise move comes at a critical time for OPEC. Its members and other major producers are due to meet in Vienna this week to discuss cutting production to boost oil prices. Concerns about oversupply have sent oil prices plunging. US crude futures hit a four-year high above $76 a barrel in early October. They are now trading at around $53 a barrel."The decision by Qatar to withdraw from OPEC does come as a surprise but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the oil market" Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Peter Kierna said.A setback for OPECQatar is the first Middle Eastern country to pull out of OPEC which was founded in 1960. Other countries have come and gone — Indonesia left in 2009 before rejoining for less than a year in 2016. Gabon rejoined in 2016 after an absence of more than 20 years. "It's a disappointment for OPEC because they've been trying to attract members" said Robin Mills CEO of Qamar Energy a consultancy firm based in Dubai. OPEC has recently been expanding in Africa with Congo and Equatorial Guinea signing up. "If you add those up [the production] is equal to Qatar's so it's kind of lost the equivalent [output] of those new members" Mills added.The 15 OPEC members collectively supply about 44% of the world's crude oil. The cartel aims to monitor the market and decide to raise or lower oil production in order to maintain stable prices and supply.Qatar has been a member of OPEC since 1961. It said the organization was aware of its decision to withdraw.,World
 (CNN)The UK's main opposition party will likely seek to topple Prime Minister Theresa May's government and force a general election if she loses a key Brexit vote early next week. If the government survives a vote of no confidence Labour could begin campaigning for a second referendum on remaining in the European Union the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Sunday. "It seems to me that if the Prime Minister has lost a vote of that sort of significance then there has to be a question of confidence in her government" Starmer told Sky News referring to the December 11 vote scheduled in the House of Commons for May's Brexit bill. Now back from G20 talks May has just one week to convince dissenting members of Parliament to pass the bill a feat the country's pro-Brexit Environment Secretary Michael Gove concedes will be "challenging."Gove told the BBC Sunday that if ministers don't pass the bill "the alternatives are no deal or no Brexit."The likelihood of rejection could increase Monday if Labour is successful in forcing May to reveal the full legal advice she sought before agreeing the deal with European leaders last month.The UK's attorney general Geoffrey Cox is due to brief lawmakers on the matter Monday but Downing Street is seeking to avoid publishing the full advice in defiance of a Commons vote last month obliging it to do so. The government argues Cox's briefing will be sufficient but Starmer said "if they don't produce it tomorrow then we will start contempt proceedings and this will be a collision course between the government and Parliament." "I accept that it's exceptional to have that disclosed. It has happened in the past but it is exceptional" he added. "That's why we had a debate in parliament to say: is this the sort of case where it's so exceptional that it should be disclosed?"This will put May in a difficult position as she attempts to lobby Conservative Party votes for her bill while potentially having to reveal compromises over the so-called Northern Ireland "backstop" position which could doom it in the eyes of pro-Brexit MPs. The backstop is designed to prevent a hard border between EU member the Republic of Ireland and Brexiting Northern Ireland -- which many fear could lead to a return to violence in the region. Under the agreement reached with Brussels failure to reach an alternate deal defaults to a backstop in the form of a "single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom." Such a situation would essentially leave the UK both in and out of the EU in line with all EU regulations and rules but unable to influence them. It would also block the most ambitious post-Brexit policies of hardliners in May's Party many of whom see such a deal as anathema to the 2016 vote on leaving the EU. As if the Northern Ireland issue wasn't bad enough for May's chances the government was also forced to admit last week that the deal will be bad for the UK's economy. According to assessments by Downing Street and the Bank of England under any scenario leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer than staying in.In the increasingly likely event therefore that May loses next week's vote Labour will almost certainly seize on it as an opportunity to bring down her government -- which is currently propped up by an unsteady alliance with the right-wing Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that is itself expected to vote against the deal. "Obviously it'll depend on what actually happens in nine days. It depends on what the response is. But if she's lost a vote of this significance after two years of negotiation then it is right that there should be a general election because but for the Fixed-term Parliaments Act the convention was always if a government loses what's called a confidence vote -- something of such significance -- then that government has to go" Starmer said. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 the government in theory has a five-year term but a vote of no confidence or a vote by two thirds of the Commons can still trigger a general election at any time making it exceedingly difficult for the government of the day to stave off an election should lawmakers wish to go to the voters. "Obviously if that doesn't happen we need to press on to other options such as a public vote because having gone through the first two options we would need to look at what happens then" Starmer said. Such a situation while it would ramp up pressure on May's government would likely be preferable to the Prime Minister who has previously attempted to paint Labour as untrustworthy on Brexit and allow her to shore up support among Euroskeptic voters across the political spectrum. While Labour has previously committed to following through on Brexit support for a second referendum has been growing inside the party and last month shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was "inevitable" that if a general election was not possible "then the other option which we've kept on the table is a people's vote."Environment secretary Gove said on Sunday that a second referendum "would undermine our democracy" and predicted that if it were held people would vote to leave "in even greater numbers." ,World
 (CNN)A Tottenham fan has been arrested for throwing a banana skin onto the pitch as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrated Arsenal's opening goal in Sunday's bad-tempered North London derby.The 29-year-old from Gabon scored Arsenal's first from the penalty spot in the 10th minute before celebrating in front of the traveling Spurs fans at the Emirates Stadium.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and videosSeveral objects were thrown in Aubameyang's direction including the banana skin."Behavior such as this is completely unacceptable and the supporter in question will be issued with a ban" a Tottenham spokesperson said in a statement.In total six arrests were made Sunday in relation to the match a Metropolitan Police statement said.The Gunners won the match 4-2 to leapfrog their local rivals into the top four coming from 2-1 down at half time to extend their unbeaten run to 19 matches.Eric Dier's strike and a Harry Kane penalty had seemingly swung the game in Spurs' favor after Aubameyang's opener.But his stunning second goal -- his 10th in the Premier League this season -- hauled Arsenal level early in the second half before Alexandre Lacazette and Lucas Torreira secured a vital three points.Both sets of players clashed after Dier's equalizer prompting Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to sprint down the touchline to act as peacemaker.Tottenham's misery was compounded five minutes from the end when Belgian international Jan Vertonghen was sent off for a second yellow card.For Arsenal's new manager Unai Emery it was a first victory over a top-six rival. Next up is a trip to Old Trafford to play a beleaguered Manchester United."For sure it is a very big victory for our supporters and we gave them this victory because it is a very special match" he told reporters. "For us it is the same it is special but above all it is three points like it was against Bournemouth and on Wednesday against Manchester United."Right now we are happy and we are enjoying it for a short time. We are at the moment the same as Tottenham in the table and they lost today. "We need also to continue creating our way and process. Today it was a very good match for our confidence but we don't forget they beat Chelsea last week in a very big match." ,World
Dr. John Lee is senior fellow at the Hudson Institute (Washington) and United States Studies Centre (Sydney) and an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own. (CNN)At the post G20 Summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump held what the White House called a "very successful meeting" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed that current US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports of 10% will remain unchanged for 90 days. Tariffs were due to be raised to 25% on January 1.According to the White House there will be a substantial increase in American exports to China of agricultural energy industrial and other products which will reduce the trade deficit in favor of China. The White House statement declares both sides will begin negotiations to resolve differences on forced technology transfer intellectual property protection non-tariff barriers cyber intrusions and cyber theft.Chinese state media reported Sunday that the two countries had reached "consensus on economic and trade issues" and that "healthy and stable economic and trade relations conform to common interests of the two countries and the whole world."The reality is far more unsettling especially for China. We are merely entering the next phase of what will be an enduring economic competition between the world's two largest economies. For America the next 90 days is about assessing testing how much further China is prepared to compromise. For China it must rethink its fundamental negotiating strategy and time is running out.Consider how China has played this game. When Trump first flagged his seriousness about tariffs China promised to retaliate with its own measures in a tit-for-tat response. Surely American firms would not tolerate increased parts and products from China which would dilute their profit margins. American consumers care more about how much they pay for their latest gadget than where it is made or assembled.Besides the widespread Chinese assumption was that talk of a trade war was sparked by the President's obsession with current account deficits. In May China apparently agreed to measures to reduce the then $375 billion surplus it enjoyed with respect to two-way trade with America even if there was disagreement about the size of the reduction. Send negotiators to work out ad hoc agreements for China to buy more American products and economic relations will continue in the same way as it had been before Trump came into power.That was China's negotiating strategy: threaten retaliatory pain for American firms and consumers and shrink the trade surplus with America. A distracted and divided as American democracy would force Trump to call a truce. Beijing miscalculated.To China's horror Trump seems to believe his own rhetoric that trade wars are good and easy to win especially when one is buying more from another country than selling to them. Washington has since made it not just about reducing the deficit but at attack on Beijing's supposed industrial policy and objectives.This includes the "Made in China 2025" blueprint which is based on the twin pillars of Chinese "self-sufficiency" and Chinese domination of global exports in these sectors. To get there America has accused China of blatant intellectual property theft and policies which offer the latter's national champions and preferred domestic firms all manner of unfair disadvantages such as subsidies tax breaks and protection from foreign competition in Chinese markets.If China is indeed guilty of these accusations then it must delay its political and economic objective to become a "moderately prosperous society" by 2021 and a fully developed economy by 2049. If China is not Trump has nevertheless placed the burden of proof on China to demonstrate that it plays according to the rules.Meanwhile inside China Xi is being accused of triumphalism and unnecessarily picking fights with America. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen almost 30% since the beginning of the year and the trade troubles come at a time when China is trying to de-leverage its economy while maintaining growth at the 6.5% target at the same time.Xi will be desperate to avoid the tariff increase on its imports to America from 10% to 25% in 90 days' time. But offering to help increase American goods into China has only temporarily staved off the threatened 25% tariff at the beginning of 2019 -- and then only for 90 days. The pain for China is far from over and Xi might have to walk back his grand economic plans for the country.  In contrast Trump has the benefit of a still buoyant stock market and a booming American economy to cushion damage inflicted by China.How will he use his advantage? In his book The Art of the Deal which was released in 1987 Trump wrote "My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after." And he has further room to move. Getting tough on China economically is perhaps his only main policy for which there is broad Democratic support significant as the latter has won control of the House in the recent Midterms.If Trump wanted to discombobulate China he has achieved that. But it is only a tactical and transient advantage. The problem remains lack of clarity with respect to objectives: going after Chinese intellectual property violations greater access for American firms in China discouraging distorting subsidies to state-owned enterprises and national champions challenging Chinese plans to dominate industries as laid out in "Made in China 2025" disentangling critical American supply chains from reliance on China or simply reducing the trade deficit.  In Buenos Aires leaders of the other G20 countries stood warily on the sidelines as they have largely done so far. They would not disagree with Trump's insistence on free fair and reciprocal trade and Trump needs other advanced economies such as the European Union nations and Japan on his side in this fight.Yet to convince that it is about more than punishing China or gaining special advantages for only American firms Trump has 90 days to make his case not just to China but to the world.,World
 (CNN)A Budapest-based university founded by billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros said Monday that it has been "forced out" of Hungary in "an arbitrary eviction."Central European University (CEU) which is a graduate institution accredited in the US and Hungary has been forced to stop accepting new students after January 1 2019 by Hungarian law. As a result it said in a statement the institution will launch all US-accredited degree programs in the Austrian capital of Vienna as of next September.It comes after the university has been subjected to verbal and thinly-veiled legislative attacks by Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The populist and anti-immigration leader has been openly critical of both Soros and CEU's academic agenda which appears antithetical to his government's nationalist worldview.CEU said that forcing the university out of Hungary violates academic freedom."This is unprecedented" CEU's president and rector Michael Ignatieff said in the statement. "A US institution has been driven out of a country that is a NATO ally. A European institution has been ousted from a member state of the EU."The statement said that over the past 20 months the university had complied with Hungarian legislation and launched educational activities in the US that were certified by American authorities. However the Hungarian government has refused to sign an already agreed-upon document negotiated with the State of New York that would allow CEU to stay."The government has never even tried to pretend that there were academic grounds for their actions" the statement said adding it was a "dark day for Europe and a dark day for Hungary." Ignatieff said that "the government has done an injustice toward its own citizens -- the hundreds of Hungarians who work and study at CEU and thousands of Hungarian alumni and their families."In response a spokesperson for the Hungarian government's international communications office told CNN that "this is nothing more than a Soros-style political bluff which does not merit the attention of the government."The emailed government statement added that "it's common knowledge that a significant number of its courses will still be held in Budapest" referring to the fact that students currently enrolled will complete their studies in Budapest.In June Hungary's parliament passed legislation -- informally known as the "Stop Soros" law -- which criminalized helping undocumented immigrants including asylum seekers. Soros' support for refugees fleeing Africa and the Middle East in recent years has made him a frequent target for Orbán's right-wing coalition.As a result in August CEU suspended programs for refugees and asylum seekers after a newly introduced "immigration surtax" threatened a 25% levy on any activities seen to assist immigration. The US State Department said in a statement it was "disappointed" that CEU and the Hungarian government couldn't come to an agreement which would allow the university to remain in Budapest. "The departure of these US-accredited programs from Hungary will be a loss for the CEU community for the United States and for Hungary" it said.The relocation to Vienna forces the university to not only leave the country it has operated in since opening in 1991 but also its recently opened premises.CEU's chairman of the board of trustees Leon Botstein said in the statement that "the City of Vienna and the federal government of Austria have welcomed up with open arms as part of their commitment to academic freedom and research."In May the Budapest branch of Open Society Foundations also founded by Soros announced it was leaving Hungary for Germany because of "increasingly repressive political and legal environment."A spokesperson for Orbán accused the foundation at the time of wanting "to create an immigrant continent and an immigrant country."

Jerusalem (CNN)Israeli police said on Sunday that there is enough evidence to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a third corruption investigation.According to a police statement authorities found evidence of fraud bribery and breach of trust.  Police also said there is enough evidence to charge the Israeli leader's wife Sara Netanyahu with fraud receiving bribes and interfering with an investigation.The case known as Case 4000 is one of the largest facing the Israeli leader and his inner circle. It deals with the relationship between the Ministry of Communications -- then under Netanyahu -- and Israeli telecommunications firm Bezeq.Investigators say Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to Shaul Elovitch the controlling shareholder of Bezeq and Netanyahu's friend. In exchange prosecutors say Elovitch gave Netanyahu favorable news coverage in online news site Walla! News which is owned by Elovitch.Police say there is enough evidence to charge Elovitch with bribery interfering with an investigation and financial crimes.Both Netanyahu and Elovitch have denied any wrongdoing. In response to the police statement Netanyahu said "The police recommendations against me and my wife do not surprise anyone. These recommendations were decided and leaked before the investigation had even begun. The police recommendations have no legal standing.""There was nothing because there is nothing" he concluded. Corruption probes building against NetanyahuPolice have already said there is enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud bribery and breach of trust in two separate cases. A final decision whether to prosecute lies with Israel's Attorney General. In Case 1000 Netanyahu is suspected of having received gifts from businessmen overseas totaling 1 million shekels (approximately $280000) including cigars champagne jewelry and more from 2007 through 2016.The second case called Case 2000 involves conversations Netanyahu had with Arnon Mozes the owner of one of Israel's leading newspapers Yedioth Ahronoth which is regularly critical of the Prime Minister.In the conversations which became public through transcripts leaked in Israeli media Netanyahu allegedly discusses limiting the circulation of Yedioth Ahronot's biggest competition in favor of more favorable coverage. Both Netanyahu and Mozes have said they were not serious discussions; rather they each claim they were trying to expose the other's lack of trustworthiness.Sara Netanyahu faces her own probe The Prime Minister's wife Sara Netanyahu was charged in July with fraud and breach of trust in a separate investigation alleging misuse of state funds at the couple's official residence.Prosecutors say Sara Netanyahu used state money to pay for $100000 worth of meals at the prime minister's residence. She also illegally paid approximately $10000 for private chefs prosecutors said.Her lawyers slammed the indictment in July describing it as "false and hallucinatory. There was no fraud no breach of trust or any other felony."Opposition demands Netanyahu resignFollowing the latest statement from police on Sunday opposition politicians once again called on Netanyahu to resign.Tzipi Livni the former Foreign Minister said "Netanyahu has to go before he takes down law enforcement authorities in order to save himself. The people of Israel deserve clean leadership.""A prime minister with so many criminal cases around him cannot continue in his job and must resign" said Avi Gabbay the head of the Labor party.Netanyahu has the backing he needs... for nowDespite the ongoing criminal investigations which began a year and a half ago Netanyahu has held on to the support of his Likud party and his coalition. Only the Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon who heads the Kulanu party has said he will withdraw support for Netanyahu if he is indicted. Under Israeli law Netanyahu does not have to resign until he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.The decision to indict the Prime Minister can only be made by the Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit who will now review the findings of the police investigation.,World
Jerusalem (CNN)Anti-Semitism and the hatred of minorities "corrupts society" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin warned in an exclusive interview with CNN. "For us it is clear as daylight. Anti-Semitism is a presence in society that corrupts society itself" said Rivlin. "We try to explain to the whole world that if you don't fight against anti-Semitism it will hit your societies. There are stereotypes present in societies that create a lack of understanding; treatment of minorities which is not humane or moral will corrupt societies."Responding to CNN's survey on anti-Semitism in Europe Rivlin said Israel must always stand strong against anti-Semitism in all its forms and in all its locations."We are diligent and we have to be even more diligent to explain in all those places where anti-Semitism is spreading or returning that we are not ready to accept it" Rivlin told CNN.The Israeli President also addressed the rise of neo-fascism in Europe and other parts of the world saying "Someone who is neo-fascist is truly a person who is totally against the spirit principles and the values of the State of Israel."This past summer Rivlin met with Hungarian President Viktor Orban who has been repeatedly accused of using anti-Semitic language by the United Nations.  Orban has been largely nationalist and anti-immigrant often calling for "ethnic homogeneity." Rivlin told him at the time "I know what you are doing against anti-Semitism. I know the efforts. But we have to remember when we say never again that neo-fascism and neo-fascist groups are a real danger to the very existence of the free world."In June Rivlin also welcomed Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz to Jerusalem. Kurz's coalition includes the far-right Freedom Party which has Nazi roots.In a readout of the meeting from Israel's government press office Rivlin said that even given Europe's complex political reality you cannot have elements which support the State of Israel but also hold positions that are racist or anti-Semitic."This is impossible" Rivlin told CNN. "It is impossible to say we admire the State of Israel and we want ties with the State of Israel but we are neo-fascists." On Tuesday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN in an exclusive interview that he was concerned with the findings of CNN's survey on anti-Semitism but not surprised. "Anti-Semitism is an ancient disease and when it rears its ugly head it first attacks the Jews but it never stops with that it sweeps entire societies" Netanyahu said. Rivlin echoed Netanyahu's language describing it as an "evil illness" that can exist anywhere. "Evil can sprout in any society that fails to examine itself that fails to remember the past and that fails to educate" he told CNN.,World
 (CNN)Activists on two continents are trying to disrupt Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's first global tour since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate last month.The tour -- which includes visits to Arab-allied countries and the G20 summit in Argentina -- is widely seen as an attempt by the Crown Prince to rehabilitate his image in the wake of a global fallout over the Saudi journalist's killing in Istanbul on October 2.In Tunisia where the Crown Prince landed Tuesday opponents of the de facto Saudi leader have been mobilizing since last week. Meanwhile in Argentina the state prosecutor has cleared the way for a formal investigation into possible criminal charges against bin Salman. On Monday Human Rights Watch lodged a complaint in Argentina against the Crown Prince invoking a constitutional war crimes clause as grounds to investigate bin Salman for possible crimes against humanity in Yemen and the killing of Khashoggi.Saudi officials admit a premeditated murder happened on its diplomatic premises in Istanbul though it denies the Crown Prince was involved. Bin Salman known as MBS is expected to attend the summit on November 30. Argentina's foreign ministry confirmed Wednesday that the Crown Prince will not be arrested on arrival in the country because he has diplomatic immunity.The prince's first leg of the trip began last week in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi whose Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed is considered his staunchest ally. He then visited Bahrain and Egypt before arriving in the Tunisian capital on Tuesday afternoon. In Tunis the birthplace of the 2011 pro-democracy Arab Spring uprisings hundreds of demonstrators waved banners and pamphlets expressing disapproval of the prince's visit. "No hellos and no welcomes to the killer of Yemen's children" read one protest banner. A giant poster hung on the façade of the office of the journalists' union depicting a shadowy bin Salman carrying a chain saw an allusion to the reported dismemberment of Khashoggi. "No to the desecration of the land of revolutionary Tunis" read the text above the image. Hundreds of demonstrators took to Habib Bourguiba street -- previously the epicenter of the uprising which unseated Tunisia's longtime dictator in 2011 -- for two days of protests that included satirical theatrical performances which portrayed bin Salman as a murderous clown. "The demonstrations in Tunisia expressed what many of the citizens of Egypt and Algeria could not" said Egyptian lawyer and human rights activist Tarek Hussein who attended the protests. "The presence of people on the street rejecting the visit of bin Salman is an important message to everyone that dictatorships are not welcome anywhere." But Noureddine ben Ticha a political adviser to Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi told CNN the prince was still welcome in Tunisia stressing the historic bonds between the two countries. Prince at the G20At the G20 bin Salman will come face-to-face with Western leaders who have been increasingly critical of the Saudi leader since the widely publicized Khashoggi murder. The CIA concluded last week that the Crown Prince personally ordered the killing according to a senior US official and a source familiar with the matter. Calls among Western countries for a ceasefire in Yemen -- where a Saudi and Emirati-led coalition is waging a three-plus-year war against Iranian-backed rebels -- have grown. Germany suspended lucrative arms deals with the kingdom last week. Denmark and Finland have followed suit. Yemen has been dubbed the world's worst humanitarian disaster by the United Nations. According to a joint statement this week by international aid groups 14 million people are at risk of starving to death in Yemen. The country is home to the world's worst famine in 100 years according to the UN. Human Rights Watch's legal action against bin Salman is the latest blow to the prince's years-long campaign to boost the kingdom's image in a bid to attract Western investment.   "Immunity didn't work for the architects of Argentina's dirty war many of whom were prosecuted and served long prison sentences" Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth wrote in a tweet referring to former officials convicted in the so-called dirty war trials in 2017. "So will the Saudi Crown Prince risk an immunity claim to show up at the G20 summit as Argentine prosecutors investigate him?" Argentina's constitution recognizes universal jurisdiction for war crimes and torture allowing courts to investigate and prosecute such crimes regardless of where they were committed and the nationality of the suspects or victims. But the administration of US President Donald Trump has so far shielded the Crown Prince from any tangible impact. Last week Trump signaled that he would not take strong action against Saudi Arabia or bin Salman for Khashoggi's murder. And on Monday two sources told CNN that the US has "slammed the brakes on" a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a limited ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid in Yemen over concerns about angering Saudi Arabia. The draft resolution crafted by the UK and obtained by CNN is already seen by human rights groups as disappointingly watered-down: It calls for a ceasefire only in Hodeidah the principal Red Sea port through which some 80% of humanitarian aid flows.The resolution is not at all critical of Saudi Arabia and in fact compliments Saudi action; it is critical only of the Houthi rebels who have been fighting the Saudi-led coalition while maintaining control of the capital Sanaa.Journalist Houda Zaghdoudi CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Jackie Castillo contributed to this report. ,World

 (CNN)Joel Embiid's career has been dizzying. In three short years he moved from playing amateur basketball in Cameroon to the NBA.Last year he signed a $148 million contract spanning five seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. Embiid is now one of the NBA's leading players leading his team to the playoffs for the first time in half a decade. But his journey from rookie to bona fide professional was anything but easy. Biggest challengesThe initial adaptation following his move to the United States was tough Embiid says with language proving a significant obstacle for him. "The biggest challenge when I moved to the States first of all I did not know how to speak English so it was hard" he explains. "I couldn't communicate with anybody. I remember even when I started playing over there my teammates were making fun of me for some reason but I was also lucky to have a couple guys on the team or in school that spoke English and French" says Embiid. "So every time I didn't understand anything they would come explain it to me and we were kind of like a big family."  "I always say my life is a movie because everything happened so fast" Embiid says of his rapid rise. The son of an Army chief and a disciplinarian mum Embiid grew up in Cameroon's capital Yaoundé and didn't start playing basketball until he was 16.He was discovered at a basketball camp in the city by NBA star and fellow Yaoundé native Luc Mbah a Moute who has come to be a bit of a mentor to Embiid.Things could have been different for Embiid who played football and volleyball as a child but he credits Basketball Without Borders - an annual instructional basketball camp organized by the NBA and FIBA globally - for giving him the opportunity to take the nascent steps in his professional career in 2011."Going back to 2011 when I was 16 I started playing and then five months later I was here [in the U.S.]. I ditched camp and I came here. I was shy" says Embiid. "I wasn't as good as everybody else but still tried. I ended up getting a scholarship to go to the state but you can say Basketball Without Borders played a huge role because that was the whole position that I wanted that I needed and I got it. And I'm thankful for that."Aiming higherIn the 2017 to 2018 season Embiid who is 24 years old was named in the NBA All-Star team for the first time in his career.  The goal he says now is to aim higher this new season. "We had a pretty good run last year. We could have gone farther than we did but this year we got our eyes on the championship. So you know just going to the finals and competing for that title is going to be great." This past summer he spent time in Johannesburg tutoring young girls and boys for Basketball Without Borders' camp and in China with the 76ers to unearth talented youngsters. Embiid aims to become the best player in the NBA not only for himself but for the entire African continent. "I'm working I'm on my way to become the best player in the NBA. And I think it will be great to say that an African is the best player in the whole world so I'm working towards that goal." Becoming the best player in a league with an array of the world's best players or winning the NBA title will not come easy and Embiid  knows this. 'Hard work pays off'He describes "the process" a principle he applies to basketball and life in general. It's a principle of hard work and patience. "The process is everything. It's a long story but the process is about you know we've gone through a lot. Like last year we won 52 games. Two years before that we won 10 games. And that's what the process is about" Embiid says. "The process applies to everything in life. Everything you have going on as long as you put in the work you going to be all good" he continued. "Hard work pays off." Embiid is now a role model for young kids in Africa and he wants them to have the opportunities Basketball Without Borders offered to him seven years ago. He has started a foundation back home in Cameroon run by his parents to help orphanages and people in need. But despite his worldwide acclaim Embiid sometimes misses the little pleasures of home. "I have a lot of great people around me in Philadelphia but you know you can never go wrong when it comes to your dad and mum. "Obviously you miss them and your siblings. That and the food. The food in Cameroon is great so sometimes I do miss it.",World
 (CNN)Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has denied claims that he died and was replaced by a clone calling the speculation "ignorant rumors."Buhari tweeted on Sunday that he addressed the reports while at a meeting in Poland."One of the questions that came up today in my meeting with Nigerians in Poland was on the issue of whether I've been cloned or not" Buhari said. "The ignorant rumors are not surprising -- when I was away on medical vacation last year a lot of people hoped I was dead."Buhari spent long periods in London receiving medical treatment in 2017 on one occasion leaving Nigeria for more than three months.His absence prompted intense speculation in the country about the President's health and many false reports circulated online saying he had died.On Instagram and Facebook Sunday the President said the belief that he had died had prompted people to reach out to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo asking to be his deputy."That embarrassed him a lot; we discussed it when he visited me while I was convalescing" Buhari said. "I can assure you all that this is the real me. Later this month I will celebrate my 76th birthday. And I'm still going strong!"Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said on Facebook that a Nigerian at a meeting in Krakow on Sunday had asked Buhari if he was real or "the much talked about 'Jubril from Sudan' -- his supposed double" -- prompting the President to affirm his identity. Shehu said Buhari was in Poland to attend the UN Climate Change Conference COP24.Buhari was elected President of Nigeria Africa's largest economy and top oil producer in 2015.The former general became President in his fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985.Buhari was among military strongmen who dominated Nigeria decades ago. A military coup brought him to power in 1983 and another military coup toppled him two years later.,World
 (CNN)Mexico swore in leftist leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador known as AMLO Saturday before a crowd that included world leaders and a strong majority in both houses of Congress.López Obrador won a landslide victory in the July 1 presidential election and began his his six-year term promising to carry out a strong fight against corruption insisting that the issue has been Mexico's worst nightmare."Nothing has harmed Mexico more that the dishonesty of the rulers" he said.    During his swearing-in López Obrador reaffirmed his intentions to sell Mexico's official presidential plane and to not live in the presidential palace. He said he will receive 40% of his presidential salary. In an extraordinary move López Obrador also announced his intention to promote a recall referendum during his administration adding the promise that he "will never seek reelection."Promises also came with criticisms Saturday. López Obrador criticized the neoliberal model that has governed the Mexican economy in recent decades saying that such policy "has been a disaster."  López Obrador also criticized his unpopular predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto for introducing "harmful" economic strategies and announced immediate public investment to rescue state oil and electricity industries while proposing the creation of a special economic zone with lower taxes along Mexico's border with the United States. Peña Nieto leaves with one of the lowest approval levels of any of the presidents. The leftist leader thanked the United States for sending Vice President Mike Pence and first daughter Ivanka Trump to his inauguration stating that since winning the presidential election he has been treated respectfully by President Donald Trump. López Obrador also thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stating he would like to reach an agreement with both Canada and the United States to tackle immigration issues.At one point the ceremony turned disruptive after López Obrador acknowledged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro causing loud protests from a group of legislators holding a banner with the inscription "Maduro you are not welcome" while chanting "dictator dictator." The feud lasted for a couple of minutes even as López Obrador continued saluting other dignitaries.

As they wait to make their case for asylum thousands of Central American migrants are living at the Benito Juarez Sports Complex which has become a makeshift shelter in Tijuana Mexico.Human-rights groups have described conditions inside this shelter as squalid and unsanitary and Tijuana's mayor says his city needs more help to handle it.It could be months before these migrants have their cases heard and the waiting list grows longer every day.,World
Tijuana Mexico (CNN)Some migrants have been shuttled to the new shelter in Tijuana where "better" accommodations include a "roof and a dry floor" according to a Human Rights Watch researcher."Much better installations at the new shelter in #Tijuana. Migrants will have a roof and a dry floor to sleep tonight. But 45 minutes away by car from the border" researcher Jonathan  Pedneault tweeted late Thursday along with two stills of an empty facility.He followed that by saying "Less funny [sic] for the single men in the new #Tijuana shelter however - no lights" along with another photo of men gathered in a covered space lit with what appeared to be only flashlights or portable lights placed on the floor.  Earlier Thursday evening buses arrived at the primary shelter the crowded Benito Juarez Sports Complex to try to shuttle some of the 6000 Central American migrants housed there to the second facility -- located in the eastern part of the city in an area known as El Barretal.The shelter will house at least 3000 people said Rodolfo Olimpo a representative from Baja California state's Special Committee on Migration Issues. Preparations for the new shelter have been in the works for days officials said Thursday. Thousands of migrants have arrived in Tijuana in recent weeks. Many are traveling as part of so-called caravans large groups that trekked from Central America largely on foot.Tensions flared Sunday when a group of migrants rushed the border and US authorities fired tear gas. Since then the situation has calmed.But Tijuana's mayor says his city is still facing a humanitarian crisis as migrants camp out awaiting the chance to make an asylum claim in the United States. A sports complex near the border has become a makeshift shelter for more than 5000 migrants. That's at least triple its capacity and human rights groups describe conditions inside as unsanitary. They've accused US authorities of creating a crisis by limiting processing at ports of entry.US officials say limited resources and capacity mean they can only process a fraction of cases on the waiting list daily.A group of migrants said Thursday that they planned to begin a hunger strike to push for the United States to speed up the processing of asylum claims.CNN's Leyla Santiago and Rosalina Nieves reported from Tijuana.

New Delhi  (CNN)An increasing demand for the scales and meat of the endangered pangolin in China and Vietnam is pushing impoverished farmers in India's north-east into the illegal trade a new report has found. Pangolins are often recognized as the world's most highly-trafficked mammal and their body parts can fetch large sums of money -- the poorest hunters in India's Assam state can earn a full year's salary for a single pangolin researchers from World Animal Protection (WAP) and the University of Oxford said Monday following a two-year investigation. Of 141 people interviewed in 31 villages over a period of 10 months "all but two of the hunters confirmed hunting pangolins for both personal and commercial use" the report said. "Scales from just one pangolin can offer a life-changing sum of money for people in these communities. But it's in no way sustainable and the numbers of pangolins in the wild are beginning to plummet" David Macdonald professor of wildlife conservation at Oxford University said in a press release.The report documents the cruelty pangolins suffer as they are hunted from their burrows or smoked out of the trees and beaten repeatedly on the head.Disturbing footage obtained by WAP appears to show poachers bludgeoning a pangolin with a machete and boiling it before removing its scales. "Suffocated with smoke beaten and boiled alive -- this is a terrifying ordeal and pangolins clearly suffer immensely" Neil D'Cruze global wildlife adviser at World Animal Protection and lead researcher said in the statement. "Not only is this a major conservation issue -- it's a devastating animal welfare concern."A lucrative tradeIn India selling pangolins for commercial gain is illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act and poaching is punishable with imprisonment of between one and six years plus a fine. A global ban on commercial trade in pangolins was issued in 2016 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).Despite this rising demand is pushing people in poor rural communities in Assam to hunt pangolins and sell them to urban middlemen who then sell them on to buyers in China and Vietnam where their scales are highly sought after for their supposed healing properties researchers found. Around 5772 pangolins were seized in India between 2009 and 2017 according to TRAFFIC an NGO working on wildlife trade.Worldwide more than a million pangolins are believed to be killed and traded between 2000 and 2013 primarily for the traditional Asian medicine trade. And between 2010 and 2015 there were 1270 reported seizures in 67 countries and territories across six continents according to the report.The brink of extinctionAll eight species of the pangolin -- four Asian and four African -- are threatened with extinction in the 51 countries where they live according to the report. Illegal poaching is directly responsible for driving pangolin numbers down the report found. Fueling this demand is the belief in some Asian countries particularly China and Vietnam that pangolin scales can treat impotence and infertility. Pangolin scales are made of keratin the same material that makes human fingernails and hair and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe they can improve blood circulation cure skin disorders and infections. The scales are also considered an aphrodisiac and the meat is a delicacy in some countries. There has been no evidence that pangolin scales have medicinal value and researchers note there have been reports that ingesting the scales can cause adverse effects such as bloating jaundice and liver damage."Pangolins are at real risk of becoming extinct -- the demand for their meat and unique scales for traditional medicine is well documented" Kate Nustedt director of WPA said in the report. "But this new evidence takes our understanding of why it's such an issue to a new level."The WPA has called for stronger enforcement of laws support for alternative livelihoods for the poachers and a coordinated push by governments and NGOs to eliminate consumer demand for the traditional Asian medicines that include pangolin parts.,World
 (CNN)A leading journalist and vocal critic of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has surrendered to a Manila court after arriving back in the country to fight tax charges that were filed in her absence. Maria Ressa the CEO of Philippine news site Rappler presented herself to court with a bail application that was approved guaranteeing her freedom until her next court appearance scheduled for December 7.Ressa and her company were formally indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion last week charges critics say are politically motivated and designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country. The formal accusations bring with them a potential 10-year prison term under Philippines tax law.In a statement on Monday Ressa said that the charges were "a clear case of harassment.""I surrendered to the court this morning went though the process of what a criminal would go through and filed bail without surrendering my right to question the Pasig court's jurisdiction over this tax case" she said. Ressa's lawyer Francis Lim confirmed to CNN that she posted Php60000 (about $1100) bail and was free to leave the court. He added that an arraignment was set for Friday."We will file a motion to quash the indictment and defer the arraignment" Lim said.Ressa an award-winning journalist who previously served as a CNN bureau chief in Manila has defended Rappler's ownership structure as "100% Filipino" and maintained the charges against her company are politically motivated. "I've long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.' The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities. I am definitely not a stockbroker" Ressa told CNN after news of the charges broke.Duterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malacanang Palace his official residence over their coverage of his administration.Thorn in Duterte's side Ressa arrived back in Manila Sunday night amid fears that she could be subject to immediate arrest but was able to leave the airport with the rest of the Rappler team. Upstart news site Rappler has become an indispensable source of information both for the international media and readers in the Philippines for its coverage of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal war on drugs.Carlos Conde Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch said Monday that "the charges filed against Rappler and its editor and founder Maria Ressa are politically motivated and part of the Duterte administration's campaign to harass threaten and intimidate critics.""This is not surprising behavior by the administration but is nonetheless abominable" he said in a statement. In a press conference Monday Philippine presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo denied that the charges against Ressa and Rappler were politically motivated. "It's a question of tax evasion. You violate tax laws and then you'll be prosecuted" he told reporters according to Rappler. "We have repeatedly said that we've never and will never interfere with the function of the judiciary. If the judiciary finds probable cause then we'll have to respect the law on the matter. Ms. Ressa is entitled to legal remedies under the law."Brad Adams Asia director for Human Rights Watch earlier said the case sent "a chilling message to journalists and human rights activists (in the Philippines) that they will be targeted for exposing his murderous campaign." 'Ridiculous' chargesIn January the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.Philippines officials claim Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar. Rappler said five cases were formally filed against Ressa and Rappler Holdings in two courts. At the time the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called the charges a "direct assault on freedom of the press." The rights group Amnesty International meanwhile claimed it was "an alarming attempt to silence independent journalism."Ressa was overseas when the charges against Rappler were first announced but she vowed to return to the Philippines and fight them even if that meant doing so from a prison cell. "In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are what our identity is and for our young reporters who are on the ground how clear and necessary our mission is today" Ressa told CNN last month."Our democracy is in transition ... the mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now and we'll continue doing these stories."CNN's Joshua Berlinger and Euan McKirdy contributed reporting. ,World
 (CNN)Images and stories from Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal war on drugs have shocked audiences worldwide as bodies have stacked up in cities across the country many of them victims of extrajudicial and vigilante killings. While the government has hardly been shy about its intention to go after both dealers and users hard data on the number of killings has often been tough to come by. One indispensable source of information both for the international media and readers in the Philippines has been the upstart news site Rappler which is now facing a reckoning with the government it has been a dogged check upon.Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and her company were formally indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion last week charges critics say are politically motivated and designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country.The formal accusations bring with them a potential 10-year prison term under Philippines tax law.On Sunday evening Ressa landed in Manila to fears that she could be arrested at the airport. She was not arrested at the airport but confirmed to reporters in the arrival hall that a warrant of arrest had been issued. Ressa said she was "ready to post bail and do what our lawyers will advise."Ressa's lawyer Francis Lim told CNN that Ressa left the airport with the rest of the Rappler team adding that they would "voluntarily surrender Maria to the court and ask it to set her free by posting bail which is a constitutionally guaranteed right under our legal system."'Ridiculous' chargesIn January the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.Philippines officials claim Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar.At the time the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called the charges a "direct assault on freedom of the press."

I am definitely not a stockbroker" Ressa told CNN Thursday after news of the charges broke.Shawn Crispin CPJ Southeast Asia representative said the charges were a "blatant form of legal harassment and underline President Rodrigo Duterte's desperate attempt to stifle its critical reporting on his government." Duterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malacanang Palace his official residence over their coverage of his administrationBrad Adams Asia director for Human Rights Watch said the case sent "a chilling message to journalists and human rights activists (in the Philippines) that they will be targeted for exposing his murderous campaign." Duterte's drug warAt least 5000 people have been killed as a result of Duterte's drug war his landmark and most controversial policy. That figure is the official police count however and opposition lawmakers and rights groups estimate the true death toll could be in the tens of thousands. Those killed have included children and innocents as well as ordinary drug users and criminals executed extrajudicially. Among Philippines media Rappler in particular has focused on the human toll of the drug war and often contested the official death counts put out by the government under the social media campaign #RealNumbersPH a self-described effort to counter what it calls a "false narrative" on the war on drugs.This has attracted criticism from both supporters of the President and Duterte himself who has long had an uneasy relationship with the press since before he was elected in a landslide in May 2016. Ahead of his inauguration Duterte defended the notoriously high fatality rate for journalists working in the Philippines as sometimes justified and accused the media of being corrupt. "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch" Duterte said in comments that were swiftly denounced by press groups. "Freedom of expression cannot help you if you have done something wrong." As many as 12 journalists were killed in the first two years of the Duterte administration higher than under any other president during a similar period according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). In the latest Press Freedom Index the Philippines fell six places to 134th of 180 countries with the report's authors warning that the "dynamism of the media has ... been checked by the emergence of a leader who wants to show he is all powerful."A dangerous jobJournalists who push back against the official narrative on the drug war both in the Philippines and overseas have faced online harassment from supporters of Duterte who organize on Facebook and other platforms to go after media critical of the President. Ressa has previously called out the effect of Facebook in enabling the spreading of disinformation and attacks against journalists online saying this has become a key policy for the Duterte administration. "We were the first two-and-a-half years before the United States started talking about disinformation we saw because of our partnership with Facebook we saw these exponential attacks on social media that began in July of 2016 the same month that the drug war began" she told ReCode last month. "In August of 2016 I gave that data to Facebook and I said this is really alarming. These people are targeting anyone who attacks who asks questions about the drug war. The drug war began in July of 2016. It's targeting journalists. It's targeting anyone who's perceived to be critical of President Duterte. Those attacks are heinous. It brings out the worst of human nature."While Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in spreading disinformation in the US and Europe the social network has also been roundly criticized for not doing enough to police its platform in Asia with both Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp accused of allowing hateful and dangerous content to be shared in countries such as Myanmar and India.Ressa was overseas when the charges against Rappler were first announced but she has vowed to return to the Philippines and fight them even if that means doing so from a prison cell. "In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are what our identity is and for our young reporters who are on the ground how clear and necessary our mission is today" Ressa told CNN last month."Our democracy is in transition ... the mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now and we'll continue doing these stories."CNN's Joshua Berlinger and Euan McKirdy contributed reporting. ,World

For the original click hereफलेडी राजस्थान (CNN Business)जमना देवी को अपना पहला मोबाइल क़रीब एक साल पहले मिला था। यह उन छोटे से स्क्रीन और नंबर्ड कीपैड वाले फ़ोनों में से था जो एंड्रॉइड और आईफ़ोन के इस युग में तेज़ी से दुर्लभ होते जा रहे हैं।भारत के राज्य राजस्थान में स्थित देवी का गांव आधुनिक बुनियादी सुविधाओं से कोसों दूर है। यह रेगिस्तान के बीच कुछेक घरों की एक शांत सी बस्ती है। दिन में केवल एक बस यहां से गुज़रती है जो पचास मील दूर स्थित सबसे क़रीबी शहर से इसका एकमात्र संपर्क है।उन्हें अपने बच्चों और रिश्तेदारों से बात करने की ख़ातिर नेटवर्क की दो लकीरें पाने के लिए अपने घर की छत पर चढ़ना पड़ता है। "वहां से मैं बात कर सकती हूं" उन्होंने बताया। "कभी-कभी बात बन जाती है। वर्ना तो यह फ़ोन बेकार ही पड़ा रहता है।"भारत के लगभग 90 करोड़ लोगों की तरह देवी ने भी न तो कभी स्मार्टफ़ोन इस्तेमाल किया है और न ही इंटरनेट का उपयोग किया है। पहले से ऑनलाइन 50 करोड़ से ज़्यादा भारतीयों के साथ उन करोड़ों लोगों को ऑनलाइन लाने की दौड़ में तकनीकी दुनिया के कई बड़े वैश्विक नाम शामिल हैं। और इस प्रक्रिया में वे इंटरनेट के भविष्य को आकार दे रहे हैं।"दुनिया की आधी से कुछ ज़्यादा आबादी ऑनलाइन है इसका मतलब है दुनिया के लगभग साढ़े तीन सौ करोड़ लोग इंटरनेट से नहीं जुड़े हैं" भारत में गूगल के मैनेजिंग डायरेक्टर राजन आनंदन ने पिछले महीने एक इंटरव्यू में सीएनएन बिज़नेस को बताया था।तो किस तरह से इन प्रयोक्ताओं को जोड़ा और इंटरनेट को उनके लिए उपयोगी बनाया जा सकता है?"ये जवाब इसमें निहित हैं कि इन 90 करोड़ (भारतीयों) को कैसे जोड़ा जाए जो ऑनलाइन नहीं हैं" आनंदन ने कहा।करोड़ों भारतीय अभी भी इंटरनेट से दूर हैं और अधिकांश स्मार्टफ़ोनों के ज़रिए इंटरनेट का प्रयोग करेंगे असंबद्धों को जोड़नाभारत इंटरनेट के उपभोक्ताओं में विस्फोटक वृद्धि देख चुका है जिसे विशाल नए बाज़ारों को हथियाने की सिलिकॉन वैली की हड़बड़ी और देश के संरचनात्मक ढांचे के आधुनिकीकरण के लिए सरकारी निवेश ने हवा दी थी।गूगल ने भारत भर में चार सौ से ज़्यादा रेलवे स्टेशनों में वाईफ़ाई सेवा स्थापित करने में मदद की है और वह ग्रामीण भारतीय महिलाओं को इंटरनेट का उपयोग करना सिखाने के लिए डिजिटल साक्षरता कार्यक्रम भी चलाता है। फ़ेसबुक अपनी एक्सप्रेस वाइफ़ाई पहल के माध्यम से 20000 हॉटस्पॉट स्थापित करना चाहता है जो लगभग 10 रुपए (0.14 डॉलर) प्रतिदिन पर उपभोक्ताओं को जोड़ेगा। सरकार की भारत भर में 250000 हॉटस्पॉट स्थापित करने की योजना है। "मेरे विचार में भौतिक संरचनात्मक ढांचे की जगह हमें डिजिटल संरचनात्मक ढांचे का निर्माण करना होगा" भारत सरकार के एक वरिष्ठ नीति सलाहकार अमिताभ कांत का कहना है।मगर निस्संदेह भारत के ऑनलाइन उछाल में सबसे बड़ा योगदान है मुफ़्त इंटरनेट की पहल जिसे देश के सबसे समृद्ध व्यक्ति द्वारा लाया गया है। मुकेश अंबानी ने सितंबर 2016 में एक हतप्रभ कर देने वाले शुरुआती ऑफ़र के साथ 2000 करोड़ डॉलर का एक नया मोबाइल नेटवर्क रिलायंस जियो लॉन्च किया। नए उपभोक्ताओं को छह महीने के लिए मुफ़्त 4जी हाई-स्पीड इंटरनेट प्रदान किया गया। इसने मूल्य-युद्ध छेड़ दिया और अन्य मोबाइल सेवा-प्रदाताओं को अपनी सेवा दरें घटानी पड़ीं। अब अपने लॉन्च के दो साल बाद जियो 25 करोड़ से ज़्यादा लोगों का उपभोक्ता आधार बना चुका है। और अंबानी की भविष्यवाणी है कि 2020 तक भारत "पूरी तरह से 4जी" हो जाएगा।"भारत का प्रत्येक फ़ोन 4जी सक्षम फ़ोन होगा और प्रत्येक उपभोक्ता 4जी संयोजकता हासिल कर सकेगा" अक्तूबर में दिए एक भाषण में उन्होंने कहा था। "हम सब जगह सब लोगों और सब चीज़ों को जोड़ने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध हैं।"गोरख दान के लिए तो जियो ने एक नई दुनिया ही खोल दी है। यह छब्बीस वर्षीय व्यक्ति जमना देवी के गांव से क़रीब 40 मील दूर जैसलमेर शहर में पत्थर के सप्लायर का काम करता है। पांच महीने पहले उसने जियो का एक सिम कार्ड लिया था और फिर क़रीब 5000 रुपए (68 डॉलर) में नोकिया का अपना पहला स्मार्टफ़ोन ख़रीदा। अब तो दान को व्हाट्सएप जिसके भारत में सबसे ज़्यादा उपभोक्ता हैं और यूट्यूब का चस्का लग गया है। अंबानी की कंपनी के प्रभाव को बताने के लिए वह एक बेहद भारतीय जुमले का प्रयोग करता है।"जियो तो सबका बाप बन गया है।"भारत के सुदूर गांवों में सावल सिंह जैसे लोगों को फ़ोन पर बात करने के लिए पेड़ों पर चढ़ना पड़ता है।इस बीच सस्ता डाटा और स्मार्टफ़ोन लाखों शहरी भारतीयों को इंटरनेट से जोड़ रहे हैं।प्रति सैकंड दो स्मार्टफ़ोनअपने चालीस करोड़ उपभोक्ताओं के साथ भारत चीन के बाद दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा स्मार्टफ़ोन बाज़ार बन चुका है। मगर वे जनसंख्या का एक तिहाई भी नहीं हैं और स्मार्टफ़ोन निर्माता शेष लोगों तक पहुंचने की दौड़ में लगे हैं।इस समय सैमसंग और चीन के शाओमी बाज़ार पर हावी हैं और दोनों ही लगातार बड़े होते जा रहे हैं — इस साल नई दिल्ली के बाहर सैमसंग ने जैसा कि उसका दावा है "दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी मोबाइल फ़ैक्टरी" बनाई है जबकि शाओमी ने अपनी क्षमता को तीन गुणा बढ़ाया है और अब भारत में प्रति सैकंड दो उपकरण का उत्पादन कर सकती है।"पश्चिम और चीन के विपरीत जहां लोग पहले ऑफ़लाइन थे फिर डेस्कटॉप लैपटॉप और फिर मोबाइल के माध्यम से ऑनलाइन हुए... लोग इन सारे चरणों को छोड़कर स्मार्टफ़ोन के माध्यम से ऑनलाइन न होने से सीधे ऑनलाइन हो गए" शाओमी के भारत-प्रमुख मनु जैन ने मई में सीएनएन को दिए एक इंटरव्यू में कहा था।ऑनलाइन होने में सबसे बड़ी बाधा स्मार्टफ़ोनों की क़ीमत है। सबसे सस्ते मॉडल भी अधिकांश भारतीयों की पहुंच से अभी भी बाहर हैं जिनकी वार्षिक औसत आय डेढ़ लाख रुपए से भी कम है। और रुपए के मूल्य में गिरावट आने के कारण शाओमी ने क़ीमतें बढ़ा दी हैं।अपने महंगे आईफ़ोनों के साथ एपल पांव जमाने के लिए संघर्ष करता रहा है और भारतीय बाज़ार में उसकी वर्तमान हिस्सेदारी मुश्किल से 2% है। दूसरी ओर ओपो और वीवो जैसे चीनी कंपनियों ने अच्छी-ख़ासी पैठ बना ली है मगर उनके सबसे सस्ते स्मार्टफ़ोन भी लगभग 10000 रुपए (137 डॉलर) के हैं।गूगल के आनंदन बताते हैं कि एकदम बेसिक स्मार्टफ़ोन भी 4000 रुपए से ज़्यादा मूल्य का होता है जबकि कीपैड फ़ोन को जिसे ज़्यादातर भारतीय अभी भी इस्तेमाल करते हैं मात्र 900 रुपए में ख़रीदा जा सकता है।"कल सुबह जब मैं जागूं और मुझे भारतीय इंटरनेट के लिए कोई कामना करनी हो तो मैं कहूंगा कि वह कम क़ीमत में अच्छी गुणवत्ता वाला स्मार्टफ़ोन उपलब्ध होने की होगी" वे कहते हैं। "अगर हम ऐसा कर सकें तो मेरा मानना है कि रातोंरात हम भारत में उपभोक्ता आधार को दोगुना कर सकेंगे।"इंटरनेट पर संवाद करने के लिए भारतीय वीडियो का अधिकाधिक प्रयोग कर रहे हैं।'इस ख़ज़ाने को आप कैसे मापते हैं?'इस बीच उन लाखों भारतीयों के सामने जिनके पास स्मार्टफ़ोन हैं अनेक विकल्प आ खड़े हुए हैं| अमेज़न ऊबर और नेटफ़्लिक्स जैसे डिजिटल बाहुबली फ़्लिपकार्ट ओला और हॉटस्टार जैसे देसी प्रतिद्वंद्वियों से मुक़ाबला कर रहे हैं।अमेज़न ने अपने भारतीय व्यापार को विकसित करने के लिए 500 करोड़ डॉलर से अधिक की राशि आवंटित की है और ऊबर ने चीन और दक्षिणपूर्व एशिया से निकलने के बाद एशिया में अपने भविष्य का दारोमदार भारत पर छोड़ा हुआ है। नेटफ़्लिक्स ने इस साल के शुरू में अपनी पहली मौलिक सीरीज़ "सेक्रेड गेम्स" रिलीज़ की और इसकी एक दर्जन से ज़्यादा मौलिक सीरीज़ जल्द आने वाली हैं।"भारत हमारे सबसे बड़े बाज़ारों में से एक है" एशिया में नेटफ़्लिक्स की संचार-उपाध्यक्ष जैसिका ली ने बताया। "आप जनसंख्या की विशालता इंटरनेट की पैठ और विकास के अवसर को देखें — चुनौती यह है कि आप इस ख़ज़ाने को कैसे मापते हैं?" इंटरनेट के उछाल ने करोड़ों डॉलर के मूल्यांकन वाली अनेक नई भारतीय कंपनियों का भी निर्माण किया जिन्होंने अपना अच्छा-ख़ासा मुक़ाम बना लिया है। ओला की टैक्सी-सेवा लगभग 110 — ऊबर से 80 अधिक — भारतीय शहरों में कार्यरत है। भारतीय ऑनलाइन रीटेल बाज़ार में अमेज़न की 32% हिस्सेदारी की तुलना में फ़्लिपकार्ट की अनुमानत: 40% हिस्सेदारी है। और भारत की अग्रणी डिजिटल भुगतान कंपनी पेटीएम ने आठ साल में 30 करोड़ से अधिक उपभोक्ता बना लिए हैं।"हम ऐसी कंपनियां हैं जो इंटरनेट के युग में जन्मी हैं" पेटीएम के सीईओ विजय शेखर शर्मा ने सीएनएन बिज़नेस को बताया। "मेरा मानना है कि इंटरनेट इस देश के सामाजिक और आर्थिक विकास का प्रमुख चालक बनेगा।"अन्य वैश्विक कंपनियां भी डिजिटल अर्थव्यवस्था में पैसा डालकर भारत में विस्तार कर रही हैं।जब वॉरेन बफ़ेट की बर्कशायर हैथवे ने इस वर्ष पेटीएम के शेयर प्राप्त किए — किसी भारतीय कंपनी में यह इसका पहला निवेश है — तो यह चीन की तकनीकी बाहुबली अलीबाबा और जापान के सॉफ़्टबैंक जैसे प्रोत्साहकों में शामिल हो गई जिसकी ओला में भी हिस्सेदारी है। फ़्लिपकार्ट का नियंत्रण अब अमेरिकी रीटेलर वॉलमार्ट के पास है जिसने इस वर्ष के आरंभ में 77% शेयर के लिए एक लाख करोड़ रुपए का भुगतान किया था।चीन की एक और बड़ी तकनीकी कंपनी टैनसेंट के पास फ़्लिपकार्ट और ओला दोनों के शेयर हैं। डिज़्नी ट्वेंटीफ़र्स्ट सैंचुरी फ़ॉक्स की अधिकांश हिस्सेदारी को ख़रीदने की अपनी डील के हिस्से के रूप में भारत के शीर्षस्थ स्ट्रीमिंग प्लेटफ़ॉर्म हॉटस्टार और इसके 7.5 करोड़ से ज़्यादा मासिक सक्रिय सदस्यों को अपने हाथ में लेने की प्रक्रिया में है।पहले भारत बाद में दुनियाभारी निवेश और तीव्र विकास के इस मादक मेल ने भारत को एक प्रयोगशाला में तब्दील कर दिया है जहां उन अवधारणाओं और उत्पादों को आकार दिया जाता है जो भारत की सीमाओं से बहुत दूर इंटरनेट को आकार देंगी।"जहां तक भारत की बात है भविष्य तो यहां आ चुका है" दक्षिण एशिया में फ़ेसबुक की सार्वजनिक नीति की निदेशक आंखी दास कहती हैं।"पहले भारत" उत्पादों और विशेषताओं की एक श्रृंखला रही है जिन्हें बाद में दूसरे देशों में ले जाया गया।ऊबर ने इस साल के शुरू में अपनी एप का कम बैंडविड्थ संस्करण 'लाइट' लॉन्च किया था जबकि डेटिंग एप टिंडर ने पहली बार भारत में एक फ़ीचर आरंभ किया जो बातचीत में पहल करने में महिलाओं को अधिक नियंत्रण प्रदान करता है। दोनों ही कंपनियां इन फ़ीचर्स को दूसरे देशों में भी ले जाने पर विचार कर रही हैं।2011 में ही फ़ेसबुक अपनी वेबसाइट का ऐसा संस्करण लाकर जो बेसिक मोबाइल पर भी काम करता था बरसों से भारत को परीक्षण स्थल की तरह प्रयोग करता आ रहा है। तब से यह मिश्रित सफलता के साथ भारत में अपनी सेवाओं के अनेक दूसरे फ़ीचर्स और संस्करण लाता रहा है।"भारत हमारे लिए बहुत बड़ी प्राथमिकता है" दास ने कहा। "यह हमेशा हमारे मिशन का केंद्र रहा है।"भारत का कई अन्य तरीक़ों से भी कंपनियों पर बहुत गहरा प्रभाव रहा है। अमेज़न ने अपने एप को भारत की सबसे ज़्यादा लोकप्रिय भाषा हिंदी में शुरू किया है और निकट भविष्य में इसकी योजना अन्य भारतीय भाषाओं को जोड़ने की भी है।130 नए देशों में वैश्विक विस्तार के हिस्से के रूप में नेटफ़्लिक्स सबसे पहले भारत में जनवरी 2016 में लॉन्च हुआ था। एक वर्ष से भी कम समय में यह दुनिया भर में अपने उपभोक्ताओं को कार्यक्रम डाउनलोड करने और उन्हें ऑफ़लाइन देखने की सुविधा प्रदान करने लगा।इस वर्ष के शुरू में नेटफ़्लिक्स ने अपनी पहली मौलिक भारतीय सीरीज़ "सेक्रेड गेम्स" रिलीज़ की और इसकी एक दर्जन से अधिक सीरीज़ जल्द आने वाली हैं।हालांकि डाउनलोड करने की विशेषता ख़ासतौर से भारत के लिए नहीं थी मगर ली का कहना है कि नेटफ़्लिक्स को उभरते बाज़ारों के अनुकूल बनाने में भारत ने बहुत बड़ी भूमिका अदा की है। "डाउनलोड्स मोबाइल कंप्रैशन वीडियो के लिए फ़ाइल के आकार को छोटा बनाना ताकि वे बेहतर तरीक़े से प्रवाहित हो सकें बफ़रिंग कम करना... ये सब भारत जैसे बाज़ारों में होने से ही हुआ है" वे आगे कहती हैं।यूट्यूब और गूगल मैप्स जैसे ऑफ़लाइन संस्करणों को लाकर और भारत की दर्जनों क्षेत्रीय भाषाओं में बेहतर काम करने के लिए गूगल ट्रांसलेट का विस्तार करके गूगल ख़ासतौर से सक्रिय रहा है।"प्रत्येक उत्पाद में हम यह देख रहे हैं कि जब हम अपने उत्पादों को वास्तव में भारत के लिए बनाते हैं या जब हम वास्तव में उन्हें इन भारतीय उपभोक्ताओं के लिए आकार देते हैं तो वे बख़ूबी काम करते हैं" आनंदन ने कहा।पहला 'आवाज़ से खोज' इंटरनेटभारत के लोग इंटरनेट के प्रयोग के तरीक़े तक को आकार दे रहे हैं जिसमें गूगल के बिज़नेस की आधारशिला — जानकारी की खोज — भी शामिल है।"ये नए प्रयोक्ता टैप या टाइप करने के बजाय इंटरनेट से बात करना पसंद करते हैं इसलिए भारत में आवाज़ से खोज प्रश्न प्रति वर्ष 270%  बढ़ रहे हैं जो कि हैरतअंगेज़ है" आनंदन ने आगे कहा। "हम वीडियो इंटरनेट तो पहले से ही हैं और अगर आप मुझसे पूछें तो मैं कहूंगा कि हम दुनिया का पहले  आवाज़ से खोज इंटरनेट बनेंगे।"भारत के स्टार्टअप भी दूर तक नज़र लगाए हुए हैं। पिछले वर्ष में ओला ऑस्ट्रेलिया न्यूज़ीलैंड और यूनाइटेड किंगडम तक में पहुंच गया है। "भारत में काम करने के लिए बड़ी कठोर प्रतिस्पर्द्धा चाहिए होती है" नवंबर के आरंभ में ओला के सामरिक उपक्रम के प्रमुख आनंद शाह ने सीएनएन बिज़नेस से कहा था। "अगर आप यह भारत में कर सकते हैं तो कहीं भी कर सकते हैं।"पेटीएम कनाडा में काम कर रहा है और इस वर्ष जापान में ऑनलाइन भुगतान आरंभ करने के लिए सॉफ़्टबैंक के साथ साझेदारी कर रहा है। "एक बार अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर विस्तार कर लेने के बाद हम निश्चित रूप से यूएस के मार्केट में जाना चाहेंगे" पेटीएम के शर्मा कहते हैं।दुनिया की दूसरी सबसे बड़ी ऑनलाइन आबादी होने के नाते यह तो निश्चित है कि भारतीयों का प्रभाव भी बहुत बड़ा होगा कांत कहते हैं। और चीनी इंटरनेट प्रयोक्ताओं के विपरीत वे वैश्विक  प्लेटफ़ॉर्मों का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं।"ट्विटर पर सबसे अधिक नागरिक भारतीय होंगे फ़ेसबुक पर सबसे अधिक नागरिक भारतीय होंगे" उन्होंने कहा।जल्द ही यूट्यूब पर दुनिया के किसी भी अन्य चैनल से ज़्यादा सब्सक्राइबर शायद बॉलीवुड के म्युज़िक लेबल टी-सीरीज़ के होंगे।भारत में किसी भी अन्य देश की तुलना में 25 वर्ष से कम उम्र के लोग हैं और तकनीकी कंपनियां उन्हें ऑनलाइन लाने के लिए दौड़ रही हैं।विनियमन को ठीक करनाविकास की बेतहाशा गति विनियमन — और अन्य लागू किए गए बदलावों — को भी जन्म दे रही है जो इस बात को आकार दे सकता है कि अन्य देशों में लोग इंटरनेट को कैसे अनुभव करें।मसलन अपने प्लेटफ़ॉर्म पर ग़लत जानकारी के लिए व्हाट्सएप की तीखी आलोचना की गई है जिसका 20 करोड़ भारतीय इस्तेमाल करते हैं।वायरल हुए झूठे संदेशों को पिछले साल सारे भारत में भीड़ की हिंसा से जोड़ा गया है जिनमें बच्चों के अपहरण की झूठी अफ़वाहों के कारण भीड़ द्वारा एक दर्जन से अधिक हत्याएं की गईं। सरकार ने फ़ेसबुक के स्वामित्व वाली इस कंपनी से झूठी जानकारी फैलाने में इसकी भूमिका के लिए बार-बार बात की है और इससे अपने काम करने के तरीक़े में बदलाव लाने को कहा है।कुछ मांगों के प्रति व्हाट्सएप का जवाब नकारात्मक रहा है जिनमें व्यक्तिगत संदेशों का पता लगाना भी शामिल है। लेकिन इसने एक लेबल बढ़ा दिया है जो यह दर्शाता है कि मैसेज सेंडर ने ख़ुद नहीं लिखा बल्कि फ़ॉरवर्ड किया है और यह सीमित कर दिया है कि एक मैसेज एक बार में कितनी चैट्स पर फ़ॉरवर्ड किया जा सकता है।ये दोनों फ़ीचर भारत में आरंभ किए गए और फिर बाद में शेष दुनिया में लाए गए। इनका इस प्लेटफ़ॉर्म पर झूठी ख़बरों और ग़लत जानकारी को रोकने में "महत्वपूर्ण प्रभाव" रहा है दास ने कहा और साथ ही यह भी कहा कि ये ब्राज़ील के हालिया चुनाव सहित वैश्विक परिदृश्य में भी प्रभावी रहे ��ैं।"मेरा ख़्याल है कि इंटरनेट की स्थिरता और विकास का दारोमदार इस पर रहेगा कि लोग इस पर कितना सुरक्षित महसूस करते हैं" उन्होंने कहा।भारतीय इंटरनेट पर टाइप करने की जगह बोलना पसंद करते हैं और देश की दर्जनों भाषाएं वैश्विक तकनीक के लिए अगली बड़ी चुनौती हैं।और अधिक विनियमन जिन पर काम चल रहा है वैश्विक इंटरनेट के अगले सीमांत के रूप में भारत की स्थिति को ख़तरे में डाल सकते हैं।डिजिटल भुगतान पर प्रतिबंध पहले ही व्हाट्सएप और गूगल को प्रभावित कर चुके हैं और ई-कॉमर्स पर प्रस्तावित नियम अमेज़न के भारतीय कारोबार को नुक़्सान पहुंचा सकते हैं। वैश्विक तकनीकी कंपनियों का कहना है कि यह प्रस्तावित क़ानून कि भारतीय यूज़र का डाटा भारत में ही स्टोर किया जाए उनके तेज़ रफ़्तार विकास पर ब्रेक लगा सकता है।"मेरा विचार है कि किसी भी क़िस्म का डाटा स्थानीयकरण देशों में इंटरनेट अर्थव्यवस्था और नवीनीकरण को धीमा करता है" गूगल के आनंदन ने कहा। "हम आशा करते हैं कि भारत प्रगतिशील होगा।"'हम शुरुआत में हैं'विनियमन पर बहस भारत की डिजिटल अर्थव्यवस्था के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है जिसे चीन द्वारा अपने विशाल इंटरनेट को वैश्विक कंपनियों से दूर रखने के फ़ैसले से भारी फ़ायदा हुआ है।गूगल और फ़ेसबुक को चीन के 80 करोड़ इंटरनेट प्रयोक्ताओं से काट दिया गया है जिसके नतीजे में उन्होंने भारी संसाधन भारत की ओर संचालित कर दिए। चीनी कंपनियां भारत की खुली अर्थव्यवस्था से भी फ़ायदा उठा रही हैं और स्मार्टफ़ोन की बिक्री व देश की बड़ी स्टार्टअप कंपनियों में निवेश करने के क्षेत्रों में मज़बूती हासिल कर रही हैं।"हमारा देश किसी भी इंटरनेट प्लेटफ़ॉर्म की सफलता के लिए आवश्यक जो अवसर और विविधता प्रदान करता है... मैं उसे लेकर अत्यधिक आशावान हूं" फ़ेसबुक की दास ने कहा।पेटीएम के सीईओ शर्मा का कहना है कि वैश्विक तकनीकी कंपनियों को बहुत ज़्यादा आज़ादी दी गई है। उनका तर्क है कि जो लोग देश में इंटरनेट के उछाल से लाभ उठा रहे हैं उनका कर्तव्य बनता है कि वे डाटा को भारत में स्टोर करें। "जब हमारा डाटा देश से बाहर नहीं जाएगा तब हम जानेंगे कि डाटा कौन इस्तेमाल कर रहा है किसलिए कर रहा है या किसलिए नहीं कर रहा है" उन्होंने कहा। "आपका बिज़नेस यहां है आपके उपभोक्ता यहां हैं बाज़ार यहां है। तो क्यों नहीं?"जैसे-जैसे और भारतीय इंटरनेट से जुड़ते जाएंगे वे दुनिया भर में इंटरनेट के प्रयोग के तरीक़े को आकार देंगे।सरकार जिस पक्ष पर भी प्रहार करे बाज़ार तो बढ़ता ही जाएगा — और वो भी तेज़ी से। गूगल के आनंदन का अनुमान है कि अधिक से अधिक 2022 तक भारत में 80 करोड़ प्रयोक्ता हो जाएंगे। "तो वास्तव में हम चीन जितना प्रयोक्ता आधार प्राप्त करने से तीन से चार साल दूर हैं" उन्होंने कहा।इसका अर्थ यह है कि तकनीकी उद्योग के लिए भारत विश्व का ख़ज़ाना है।"वास्तविकता यह है कि आज भारत का केवल 30% ऑनलाइन है। वास्तविक भारत जिसे इंटरनेट की ज़रूरत है जो इंटरनेट से फ़ायदा उठा सकता है वह अभी तक ऑनलाइन नहीं है" आनंदन ने आगे कहा। "हम कई मायनों में भारतीय इंटरनेट की शुरुआत में हैं।",World
New Delhi  (CNN Business)India's economy has downshifted from warp speed. Gross domestic product expanded 7.1% in the quarter ended September according to official data. That's a big step down from 8.2% growth in the previous quarter.The slowdown was sharper than analysts had expected. But the reduced rate still places India ahead of China — which grew at 6.5% over the same period — as the world's fastest-growing major economy. India's economic performance is being closely watched as next year's general election looms into view. Prime Minister Narendra Modi won office in 2014 after a campaign in which he promised to boost India's economy and create millions of jobs. Shilan Shah an economist at Capital Economics cautioned that India's GDP statistics are not always the most reliable. But he said recent data on industrial production and vehicles sales also indicated weaker growth.Still the torrid pace of expansion in the previous quarter would have been difficult to maintain. Shah said he expects growth to remain at healthy levels."The economy should continue to expand rapidly over the coming months supported by looser fiscal policy ahead of next year's general election" he said. Pranjul Bhandari chief India economist at HSBC said that growth was likely to remain above 7% for the next few quarters a pace that can be sustained "without stoking macroeconomic instability."Some of the biggest pressures on the Indian economy have eased in recent weeks. A 35% drop in oil prices since early October has helped India which is one of the world's top energy importers. The rupee which hit a series of record lows against the dollar this year strengthened more than 5% in the past month. Shah said that India's central bank which held off on raising interest rates last month after two hikes earlier this year will likely keep them unchanged again when it meets next week. ,World
Hong Kong (CNN Business)Samsung's latest bendable screen technology has been stolen and sold to two Chinese companies according to prosecutors in South Korea. The Suwon District Prosecutor's Office charged 11 people on Thursday with stealing tech secrets from Samsung (SSNLF) the office said in a statement.The prosecutors allege that a Samsung supplier leaked blueprints of Samsung's "flexible OLED edge panel 3D lamination" to a company that it had set up. That company then sold the tech secrets to the Chinese firms for nearly $14 million according to the prosecutors. They did not name the people or companies involved in the theft. Samsung Display a subsidiary of the South Korean conglomerate said in a statement Friday that it was "surprised and appalled at the results of the investigation by prosecutors." The findings come at a time of intensifying competition for new tech among rivals. Prosecutors said Samsung invested six years and some 150 billion won ($130 million) to develop the bendable screen.  As demand for high-end smartphones begins to wane in key markets companies have been searching for the next big thing to convince consumers to upgrade their devices. Samsung's bendable screen had been hyped as a potential game changer. The company teased the tech at a conference earlier this month showing images of a new folding smartphone. Samsung is the world's largest smartphone maker accounting for about 20% of global market share last quarter according to research firm Canalys. Investigators have not been able to track down and question two Chinese individuals believed to be involved in the case and have asked Interpol to help find and detain them. Of the 11 people indicted three have been detained. A trial date has not yet been set. ,World
 (CNN)When Canada lines up for its first game of the 2019 Rugby World Cup against Italy in Fukuoka there is likely to be a swelling of national pride and just a smidgeon of residual relief. Having left it to the last possible juncture to qualify for the four-yearly showcase -- which brings tension considering Canada has competed at every single Rugby World Cup -- the Canucks won the repechage event in Marseille in November and go into World Cup Pool B with New Zealand South Africa Namibia and those Italians.It has been a slog to get to this point. Since the last World Cup in 2015 the men's 15-a-side team has tumbled down the global rankings and in recent years has suffered humbling losses including defeats against rivals USA and Uruguay in earlier World Cup qualifiers. There have been coaching reshuffles financial restructuring and a lot of worry about funding if Canada were to fail on the road to Japan. Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosYet in Marseille Canada negotiated its way past Kenya Germany and Hong Kong and safeguarded part of its future. Now it is all settled Canadian players and management can look back on how tough it was. Did the athletes feel the pressure of history given Canada had never missed a World Cup before?"We talked about it the whole time" says DTH van der Merwe the free-scoring wing who bagged five tries in the repechage event. "We all knew that the stakes were high. "If we didn't make it we'd be the first Canadian team not to go to the World Cup. That's plain and simple. Then you lose all the funding which is massive for professional sports and for Rugby Canada. World Cup funding is huge and we don't have massive backers who could pull us out of this rut. I'm happy we got there."According to Gareth Rees a fly-half for Canada in the first four World Cups and now Rugby Canada's director of commercial and program relations qualification is a much-needed boon for a nation that has had real struggles of late."The invention of the World Cup was hugely important for Canadian rugby" he explains. "It gave us a focal point every four years and when that opportunity was perhaps not there it forced us to rethink a few things. "It would have been a big problem had we not made it to Japan."Firstly finances would have been up out the door. There's a lot of support that comes from World Rugby because you're part of the World Cup family. And obviously for young athletes we compete with ice hockey and gridiron and soccer and every other sport in Canada. So to not have that showpiece every four years would not allow us to attract the best athletes and not allow us to grow the game as we want."READ: Joe Schmidt to step down as Ireland coach'We've been through a lean patch'There has been a tightening of belts in the last few years. You know of the floundering fortunes of the men's 15s side. Then earlier this year with the union taking the tough decision to merge resources from sevens and 15s to make 15-a-side rugby its stated priority there was friction.Men's sevens players refused to sign new deals. Sevens players who had historically featured for Canada in 15s World Cups and qualification made themselves unavailable for this repechage event.Issues have been resolved in Canada now and the Canucks will be at rugby's biggest party once again this time in Japan. However there would have been serious questions asked about Canada's rugby future had the outcome been different.In September 2017 former Wales flanker and ex-Russia coach Kingsley Jones took up the reigns to try and guide Canada through an earlier qualifier that it ultimately lost to Uruguay. To the relief of a nation Jones helped the team realize its dream at this last-chance event.READ: Homophobic attack prompts France team to wear rainbow lacesHe lays out the size of the task: "You are where you are for a reason. I don't think it's dragging the team through it -- we've been through a lean patch. "A lot of very good players finished in 2015 and it leaves a hole. We've worked hard to create more depth all down to the support of Rugby Canada the support of all the local clubs in Canada to release players so they're able to train do extra conditioning sessions. "It came through (at the repechage) and the whole country's allowed these players to be here to work hard and win three games on the trot." What next?Asked immediately after qualification what this means for an upcoming Americas Rugby Championship tournament and then World Cup preparation Jones laughs: "I haven't got a clue! "I've been to World Cups before but I've finished this we got our season mapped out if this happened but it's the wrong time to ask me."I'll think about it on the journey home I guess!"Gathering his thoughts he continues: "It probably hasn't hit me yet that we're going. We'll have a breathe look forward to going to Japan. It will be great. "I'm not focused on the All Blacks tonight! We've just had a big period but it'll be great to be in that group. We've got a good team we're growing. We've got a winning habit.",World
 (CNN)New Zealand won the opening tournament of the men's World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai after beating the USA 21-5 in the final. The victory New Zealand's first in Dubai since 2009 backed up July's World Cup win in San Fransisco. The omens for this season are good too as for the past three seasons the winner of the season's first tournament has also gone on to lift the overall title.Tone Ng Shiu's try gave the Kiwis a 7-0 lead heading into halftime but they were reduced to six men at the start of the second period and Stephen Tomasin mustered a repsonse for the USA. Scores from Dylan Collier and Ngarohi McGarvey-Black however ensured New Zealand wrapped up its sixth title in Dubai."I'm incredibly proud of how the boys played in those last two games" said captain Scott Curry who was one of four injured New Zealand players sidelined during the final."We'll take a lot out of how we played in those last two games. We were down to nine men and we were rotating our subs. The guys defended their hearts out."Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosNew Zealand reached the final by way of wins over Wales Spain Scotland England and two victories against the USA.For the Eagles this year's tournament was a vast improvement on the 2018 edition when they lost all five games and placed joint-last overall.

 (CNN)He had swum for 157 days around the entire coastline of Great Britain but as Ross Edgley approached the finish of his epic adventure he was energized by something "special" in the water.He had battled extreme fatigue cold pain jellyfish stings and parts of his tongue falling off during the 1792-mile journey but there to greet him on a freezing November morning were 300 swimmers to guide the weary traveler to the shore. "When I think about it I can't help but smile" he told CNN Sport. "The best way I can describe it is goosebumps upon tears upon smiles. Literally you could feel something in the water. It sounds a bit spiritual but it was just amazing."Edgley had just become the first person to achieve the epic feat of endurance. Starting on the south coast of England he was at sea for nearly 23 weeks without once stepping back on land. Come rain or shine he swam twice a day in six-hour shifts using lessons he learned while training with the Royal Marines. "Focus on the process and the outcome is inevitable" said the Briton.Mental resilience Many told him that he was mad to attempt it. The water was too cold and the tides too strong they said. For Edgley though that was the exact motivation he needed. The 33-year-old thrives off the impossible and the desire to prove everyone wrong. "I knew how to put one arm in front of the other" he joked. "It's just the case of doing that until you got all around the coast." Meeting in London Edgley somehow retained an impressive level of vigor just days after completing the mammoth challenge. He even had an infectious enthusiasm for his multiple media commitments treating them as therapy for the hardship that he tried to block out over the summer. It was this positive attitude to life combined with a "feral" ability to keep putting his face back into the freezing cold water that made it possible.  Just like his physical prowess Edgley's mental resilience has been refined over the years. He graduated with a 1st class honors degree from Loughborough University School of Sport and Exercise Science and has continued his fascination with sports psychology ever since. The theories he learned enabled him to ignore the "physiological hand-brake" when his mind would tell his body to stop. "I was in pieces but I thought 'Are you actually completely fatigued or is that you just trying to pull that physiological handbrake? Have you got any more?'" he said.  'Eccentric explorer'Unsurprisingly Edgley comes from an active family. His mother was a sprinter his father a tennis coach one grandfather a marathon runner and the other in the military. Sport was all they would talk about over dinner and Edgley developed a fascination for fitness and mammoth tests of endurance. Before this swim Edgley had climbed a rope to the height of Everest run a marathon while pulling a car and completed a triathlon whilst carrying a 100-pound tree. Some of his motivation stems from a desire to emulate a previous British explorers.Captain Matthew Webb who in 1875 became the first man to swim across the English Channel is a particular source of inspiration. Like Edgley and the Great British Swim everyone told Captain Webb that swimming the Channel was impossible. "There was something about that which was so amazing so British" he said. "This eccentric explorer I loved it."The darkest moments Edgley was accompanied on his odyssey by husband and wife duo Matt and Suzanne Knight. Their boat was the support vehicle where Edgley rested ate and slept when not in the water.  Swimming as they all found out was just a small part of the expedition.The stories Edgley tells of extreme cold sleep deprivation and wet-suit chaffing (so bad that his open wounds stuck to his bed sheets) instead defined his swim. There was one particular run-in with mother nature that really stood out. While navigating the Gulf of Corryvreckan in Scotland -- home to the third largest whirlpool in the world -- Edgley was hit in the face by a jellyfish. This was nothing new. Edgley was stung 37 times during the journey but this sting felt "a little different" he said. "It just didn't go away it was searing into my skin."After hours of swimming through excruciating pain Edgley identified the root of the problem. He found the tentacle which had applied the first sting threaded through his goggles. It had been slapping him in the face for hours causing multiple stings to his left eye. "The goggles wouldn't fit back on my face because my left eye was so swollen" Edgley laughed. "I had to just punch the goggles into my face so that they no longer leaked and then I could carry on swimming."It's just one of the nightmarish scenarios that Edgley could not prepare for. His training nevertheless was brutal. Having previously written "The Word's Fittest Book" Edgley wanted to put his theories to the test. The hours spent in the gym swimming pool and the open water were all informed by the multiple endurance events he'd previously completed. He developed the concept of work capacity -- which considered how much his body could take and still recover from. After pushing this boundary to its absolute limit it became evident that the Great British Swim could on paper be possible. That small glimmer was enough.Eating with an eroded tongueFood was also a vital component of the mission. A diet plan had been carefully created prior to the start but it didn't last long. Instead it was a diet of necessity. Edgley consumed between 10000-15000 calories a day to meet the energy requirements of his body.  The method would often throw up some unlikely combinations such as a feast of two-deep fried pizzas and a super-healthy green shake. "I call it edible exploration it's whatever works for me. It was as much an exploration of my digestive system as it was the British coastline" he said. There was also the surprising problem with palatability. After weeks of swimming 12 hours a day Edgley developed salt-tongue which made eating certain foods "taste like sandpaper." It's a condition caused by sea water which erodes the tissue and causes part of the tongue to fall off (it has since grown back). Bananas were sometimes the only thing Edgley could cope. He consumed a remarkable 649 bananas recording each on the cabin roof. His physique has changed a lot since the start of the swim when he had a body sculptured by hard work in the gym. He has added 10kg of "seal blubber" to his upper body and is now learning to walk properly again after "skipping leg day" for almost half a year. A lack of walking has caused the arches of his feet to sink. "Getting back on land my feet are like 'What are you doing? They are still struggling to figure out what's going on'" he said.  The fitness expert is proud of his new physique though and hopes to encourage others to be "instruments not ornaments" an indication of how he views an aesthetics-driven fitness industry. What next?Despite the obvious hardship Edgley looks back positively on the experience and insists that he's not yet bored of swimming. "The sunsets swimming with minke whales and dolphins. For all of the hardship which is easy to talk about there were so many privileges as well" he said. Edgley has promised his family some time off before embarking on his next challenge. "If you can swim around Great Britain where else can you swim to?" he teased. "I'll have my Christmas dinner and then maybe next year." ,World
 (CNN)If a New Year heralds a fresh start then for Christian Wade -- who has left a prolific rugby career for a shot at the NFL -- January 2019 will be more of a leap into the unknown.  "I've never played it" he confesses "just watched as a fan and admired from afar."  American football has a long history of welcoming players from different athletic backgrounds or of watching players leave to pursue opportunities in another sport. Few cross-code players however have pedigree quite like Wade.For the past eight years he's established himself as one of rugby's most explosive talents and at the age of 27 showed no signs of slowing down.His elusive speed enabled him to run rings round defenders accumulating a highlights reel of tries that would be the envy of some of the game's most potent attackers.Scoring always came naturally to Wade whose 82 Premiership tries for English side Wasps put him third in the league's all-time list just 10 shy of a record he seemed nailed-on to surpass.  None of this of course escapes the former winger who a few weeks ago cut short his club contract to pursue a career in the NFL. "I just felt I needed a new challenge" he tells CNN Sport. "I felt like I had come to a point where something like the NFL was a great opportunity and something I believe I can do well in."Wade would become the third English rugby player to sign for an NFL franchise if he gets selected through the International Player Pathway Program which gives teams an extra spot in their practice squads for players from outside the US.Alex Gray who captained Wade at England under-20 level is over a year into his journey with the Atlanta Falcons while Christian Scotland-Williamson who attended the same high school as Wade is playing with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Both however left rugby at an earlier age than Wade who knows he has a mountain to climb in what can be a ruthless process. "Speaking to Christian he's saying he's seen players that are there on the Monday and come the Wednesday afternoon they're not in training because they've been cut" says Wade. "It's so cut-throat -- you don't know what's going to happen."The next six weeks for me are about building strength power and speed. "In rugby you have to be prepared to run like 7 km a game and within that do lots of different things. The NFL requires you to be able to go 100% and be explosive and powerful and quick in short bursts with limited time to recuperate."'Enjoyment first'With a block of NFL-based training under his belt Wade will head to Florida in January for a three-month training camp where intensive 17-hour days await."We will obviously be training hard again" he says "but it will be more centered around learning football -- learning plays and terminology learning the playbook learning what a professional athlete's lifestyle is going to be like in the NFL."Amazon's "All or Nothing" series has piqued Wade's interest in gridiron and when he speaks enthusiastically about the likes of Tyreek Hill Saquon Barkley and Odell Beckham Jr.it's clear he intends to impress with his agility Stateside. Cynics would point to the big pay packets at the top of the NFL as motivation for a newcomer to the sport but practice squad players are reported to earn a base salary of $129000. Wade knows that in leaving rugby he's sacrificing security. "I've got good money coming in I'm a regular starter for my team I've got potential to go abroad and earn more money and stuff" he says."But for me it's never really been about the money as such. It's about enjoyment first. Pushing my body testing myself -- all that will come with it."A 'frustrating' England careerIf enjoyment is a priority then the suggestion is that some of rugby's early appeal has faded. Wade made his England debut in 2013 having scored 13 tries in the Premiership season and soon afterward was called up to the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia. What appeared to be a blossoming international career however was short-lived as Wade fell out of favor with then-England coach Stuart Lancaster. His first cap was also his last. "It was frustrating" he says "but at the end of the day it's one man's opinion ... When opinions are formed it's hard to change them. "I've always been scoring tries I've always been top try scorer [in the league] or top three every season. That's been a given for me. Maybe there's something else they were looking for." At only 5ft 8in the notion that Wade was just too small for international rugby was often cited or that his defensive qualities paled in comparison to his attacking prowess. He became accustomed to putting such criticism aside but you get the impression it kept niggling away even when the disappointment of several England omissions were behind him.  And at a time when players are getting bigger and thumping collisions are becoming more common does Wade think rugby will cease to be a game for the small guy? "I don't know it's hard to say" he muses. "Some people will say it's not for individuals of all shapes and sizes or whatever but you still see there's players out there who are dominating. You've got Cheslin Kolbe for South Africa [Nehe] Milner-Skudder playing for New Zealand. There's still players out there who are small."For me it's always been that it doesn't matter what size or shape you are. If you're there to do a job and you're doing it well then there's no reason why you shouldn't get picked."If Wade really has played his last ever game of rugby then one sport's loss is another's gain. But he refuses to make any guarantees on his future admitting he'd be open to a return to rugby -- perhaps to chase that Premiership try record. "Rugby's wicked man" he says. "I've loved it since I was 15 or 16. It's been really good to me."I appreciate everything from my rugby career but it's a new chapter now. Obviously it's a lot of work and those 17-hour days definitely make me nervous. Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos"I'm intrigued to see what I can produce." ,World
 (CNN)Come summertime the harbors of the Dalmatian Coast French Riviera and Amalfi Coast fill with luxurious superyachts.These incredible vessels are owned and enjoyed by celebrities royalty and titans of industry.The smooth running of these colossal boats depends on a troop of dedicated workers. And among the most diligent are stewardesses.They call themselves "glorified housekeepers" but they're much more than that.They're also entertainers cleaners cocktail mixologists waiters and even yoga teachers.Chief Stewardess Gemma Hulbert has been working as a "stew" for almost seven years. "We're caretakers for the guests -- anything and everything they need is done before they need it" the 25-year-old explains adding that guest requests at times can be quite unusual. Once she says a guest only wanted to bathe in half a tub of hot water that was then topped off with half a bottle of none-other than Fiji water and half a cup of baby oil."That was so much fun to clean from the marble after" Hulbert quips."I've also had a charter guest in the past who purchased a vintage Hermes bag in the States so our purser (the officer on board who keeps the accounts) had to organize a private jet to go to the States from Monaco to pick up the bag and bring it back so she could take it to a gala the next day" she adds.READ: Land of superyachts super casinos and super richChelsea Nielsen also works as a superyacht stewardess and on-board yoga teacher -- something she calls both exhausting and rewarding."They (guests) are used to luxuries -- they're desensitized to having help 24/7 and having people take care of them 24/7" the 33-year-old tells CNN from Monaco during one of her rare days off."Of course they have expectations as I do if I go to a restaurant but as far as people being the clients I have worked with or worked for have truly only been grateful and gracious."You can always tell who has come down from generations of wealth -- they just carry themselves with a bit of grace and class versus maybe someone who has just come into money for the first time and they have a little bit of their nose in the air little bit of an attitude about them."No judgment of course! It's just interesting."'Celebrities aren't the norm'Nielsen has worked on both private and chartered yachts -- including the award-winning 312ft motor yacht Kismet owned by billionaire Shahid Khan owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Fulham FC. It reportedly charted guests Beyonce and Jay-Z in July. "I get asked about what celebrities I've met and I've been lucky to have met a few but that's not the norm from what I have found -- at least from my experience. Of course there are celebrities who own yachts but it's not as prevalent as really wealthy entrepreneurs who have been smart with their investments and can afford to throw money into a big hull in the water" Nielsen says.READ: Super-sized superyachts vie for supremacy"It may be someone who has a specific brand or product that has exploded or someone who makes a specialized product for cars. One of my previous bosses brought the concept of loyalty rewards to his country so all the grocery stores in his country now have loyal reward programs."It's common practice for stewardess' to sign non-disclosure agreements to protect guest identities. Something Nielsen says is out of privacy and respect.Reconnecting guests via yogaNielsen compares her hours to that of doctors. "Basically we're on call 24/7" Nielsen explains. Generally she works a 13 hour day -- with a two-hour break during the day and a nine-hour break overnight. She does everything from maintaining the boat serving breakfast lunch and dinner and entertaining guests by offering them yoga classes. READ: World's tallest superyacht takes to the sea"The yachting industry is very materialistic and very luxurious and a lot of beauty is to be said about it but you can lose track of your heart and soul and the things that really matter in life and I feel honored to be able to reconnect people to that part of them."Toothbrushes toothpicks and cotton budsNielsen and Hulbert like many others document their stewardess lives on Instagram. And while it may look glamorous as they spend the year chasing the sun from Mexico to the Caribbean and Europe they sometimes only catch a glimpse of their surroundings through the yacht portholes as they clean guest suites with toothbrushes toothpicks and cotton buds."It's pretty crazy" Hulbert says. "When we go into every guest cabin on a daily basis we open every product every piece of makeup every item of face-wash and we check the cap. You clean it so it looks like it's just come directly from the shop. If it's foundation you wipe everything perfectly clean."READ: The $1 billion superyacht -- Bigger longer but is it better?You've got to become a perfectionist and constantly spot the imperfections she says."When we wipe glass or mirrors we turn off all the lights and use the flashlight on our phone and then check for any smears or watermarks that we may have missed -- that's the closest possible way to making it as perfect as possible. "We've always got rags in our pocket wiping every fingerprint. If a guest touches a light on you go and wipe that light switch if they go into their cabin and sit on their bed you make that bed so it looks like it's never been touched and the second they use a bathroom you're straight in there and giving it a clean."'Attractive wages with no expensesDespite the long hours it is an industry that offers attractive wages -- with stewardess salaries ranging from $2700 to over $9000 per month depending on experience and yacht size -- and that doesn't include tips. It's customary to tip crew at least 10% of what the yacht costs to charter which is then divided up among staff. So with most chartered yachts costing between $300000 to over $1 million per week (not including fuel water or food) -- crew can expect to get upwards of $2000 additional in tips. There's also no expenses -- with board meals and toiletries all covered."Before you know it you can receive triple your month's wage after two weeks -- cash in hand" Nielsen says.READ: Six of the world's most exclusive yacht charters"I remember the first time it happened and looking at the envelope of just cash and not even knowing what to do with it. Of course being American and seeing Euros I'm like 'this could be monopoly money for all I know. This hasn't even registered what's in my hand right now it doesn't even look real.'"Keeping up appearancesNielsen recalls hearing of another boat whose owners would also give stewardess' extra cash for hairdressing appointments because they stipulated that they all had to have blonde hair."That was the first time I had ever heard of that" she says. "They would give them an extra hundred bucks a month to make sure they went and got their hair done and maintained."Some owners who are sensitive to smells order no one to wear perfume Nielsen says while others ask for the opposite."One of my bosses worked for a scent company that's how he made his money -- fragrances and air purifies -- and he really loved smells so we all wore perfume" she says. READ: Will $667M superyacht be built?Appearance is important say both Nielsen and Hulbert and that can be problematic. "It's very tough to get a job if you've struggled with weight" Nielsen says. "It's a physical job and if you're someone who struggles with that it may be a challenge for you." As well as that tattoos are often off-limits -- even if they're not visible. "Some boats are all men some boats probably don't have any employees of color some boats won't hire a woman just because the owner doesn't like what your picture looks like on your CV" Nielsen says.As chief stewardess Hulbert says she's considered the "face of the entire interior.""At the end of the day we're doing whatever we can to keep the owner happy" she adds.Finding love through the portholeDespite the long days both women happened to find love on board in between the cleaning and guest demands. "I saw him through the porthole of a boat next door and finally met him" Hulbert says of her now-husband who work together on the same boat.Nielsen also met her partner on board."It's very challenging to maintain a relationship with someone who might not understand what it is you're going through -- I can only text you at certain times of the day I probably can't call you because my service doesn't work in the middle of the ocean I'll text you five minutes before I go to bed and then I'm going to have to go to sleep."Having that partner on board especially if you're lucky enough to share a cabin it's nice to go back and vent to each other hug each other and remind each other that everything is going to be OK.",World
Carson City Nevada (CNN)Florence Phillips was born in New York to Jewish parents who fled Europe before the Holocaust.Growing up she experienced first-hand the burden of being a child of immigrants who didn't speak English. Helping her parents interact with the outside world fell on her shoulders."I did all the translations for them" Phillips said. "I saw how they struggled being new to a country and not knowing the language."For most of her life Phillips worked various desk jobs. Then in her late-50s she enlisted in the Peace Corps. She served three tours—in Kenya Guatemala and Jamaica—working on community-building projects and teaching English.After returning to the US in 1999 at age 69 Phillips realized there were countless people in her own backyard in need of her support. "It came to me that I didn't have to leave the US or my hometown to help. I could do here what I did overseas" she said.She became an AmeriCorps volunteer and moved around the country eventually settling in Carson City Nevada. There immigrants make up roughly one in five of the state's population. Phillips met many adult immigrants who were struggling to learn English.To address the need she started the ESL In-Home Program of Northern Nevada a nonprofit that provides free ESL (English as a Second Language) citizenship GED and computer classes.Since its inception in 2004 the nonprofit has helped more than 5000 immigrants and their families. Today at 87 years old—when most people are deep in retirement—Phillips shows no signs of winding down. CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Phillips about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: What are some of the barriers that get in the way of immigrants accessing English classes? Florence Phillips: It was amazing to see how many immigrants there were that wanted to learn English. I got calls from all over Nevada. Many of these immigrants could not attend ESL classes because the schools and other organizations have a set schedule and their times were not convenient for the student who works three jobs. So my program teaches morning noon night weekends holidays. We provide these services at the times and days that the student is available and wherever the student is or can be. My program is very flexible. We teach English on all levels to immigrants and refugees in Northern Nevada who want to learn. There is no other program like this in the state. We give the students personal attention; I match them with a tutor. We teach at no cost to the student.There are people who were living in rural counties and in other counties where they did not have transportation if there was a class available for them to go to. If they lack transportation just had a baby are sick or disabled we will tutor in their own homes or the tutor's home.CNN: Your program also provides free classes that help people prepare for their citizenship test.Phillips: It is a very difficult test. A lot of Americans say they could not pass. These people have to know the answers to questions about the branches of government how many senators there are etc. It's a lot of history a lot of civics a lot about our government. They have to know how to write how to read. They have to know how to converse in English with the interviewer. We do all of that for them. We have a mock interview at the end of the class so that they know what to expect when they go for their exam. It takes a commitment of coming to a 12-week class. It takes a lot of memorization.To apply for citizenship today it costs more than $700. Many of our students cannot afford to apply. So we help to raise money to help these students apply. Whether they're working two three jobs they have to sit down and study every single day and they make that commitment because it is their desire to become an American. My students inspire me because of their dedication their commitment their motivation to learn. CNN: How has your work affected the lives of your students? Phillips: I have students that were promoted to be supervisor. I get students who call me and say "I was able to talk with the teacher about my child." And I'm being told by the students that they went to the market and the clerk understood them. Those are the rewards I get as they progress. My students love this country. They are very proud about being here learning English learning our culture. I see the pride when they say "I am an American." Want to get involved?

Twin Falls Idaho (CNN)A simple project to help a family in need stopped Luke Mickelson in his tracks.In 2012 he and his family were inspired to build and donate a bunk bed after learning there were local children who slept on the floor."This little girl had a nest of clothes it looked like a little bird's nest. And that's what she slept on that's what her bed was" Mickelson said. "When we delivered the bed she hugged it and just couldn't let go."Shocked to discover how widespread this need was in his close-knit community Mickelson founded Sleep in Heavenly Peace a nonprofit that builds and delivers beds to children in need."It was such an eye-opener to me" he recalled. "I sat there in silence thinking 'Is that really what's going on?'"Born and raised in Idaho Mickelson now 41 was a high school quarterback-turned-family-man. A churchgoer with a thriving career he coached his kids' sports teams and fished in the nearby river. But when he met children who were sleeping on the floor his idyllic life changed course. "I had no clue about what the need was" Mickelson said. "There's kids next door whose parents are struggling just to put food on the table clothes on their back a roof over their head. A bed was just a luxury."Using safety guidelines and his daughter's bunk bed as a template Mickelson started buying wood and supplies to build beds with his own money. He recruited friends and family members to help around the holidays. As word spread interest and involvement from his and other communities surged -- along with Mickelson's bunk bed output."That first project we built 11 bunk beds in my garage" he said. "The next year we did 15. Then it doubled every year. In 2017 we built 612 bunk beds."Mickelson set up a formal charity complete with training courses construction manuals and local chapters so communities from coast to coast could join the movement. With the motto "No kid sleeps on the floor in our town" the nonprofit and its more than 65 chapters have built and delivered more than 1500 free beds to children across America. But along with the rapid growth Mickelson was faced with a tough choice: advancing his career or his nonprofit. He chose the latter and went from making "great money to zero money." He's never looked back."I found that the need I have isn't financial" he said. "The need I have is seeing the joy on kids' faces knowing that I can make a difference."CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Mickelson about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation. CNN: Who are your group's bed recipients?Luke Mickelson: These kids that we serve in our community come to us from all walks of life. They didn't get into this situation because of their choices. Often they take their clothes off at night put their pajamas on and sleep on top of their clothes. And then they just repeat that cycle every day. We have a lot of situations where single parents are escaping an abusive situation. A lot of foster care situations where parents or grandparents or brothers and sisters are trying to help. A lot of homelessness people trying to get back on their feet. A $300 or $400 bed is just out of the possibility for them.  CNN: How do they find you?Mickelson: For someone looking to apply for a bed they can go to our website and click on "Request a Bed." Once that application gets filled out based on the zip code of the recipient it goes to the closest chapter president then through a vetting process.

It just came to a point where I could see that my passion really is helping these kids. It was gratifying to see my kids and my family be involved with it and help them learn the value of service but also seeing everybody else feel and see that joy from helping kids get off the floor. It's contagious.I was very fortunate to have another company offer me a job. Granted I took a huge pay cut but it helps me get by and helps me do what I need to do with Sleep in Heavenly Peace.

We make sure that they understand that "This is your bed. This is yours. This is a possession of yours" you know? The underlying tone is "We're here for the child." You walk in and these kids are just so excited. They want to help build it. They want to run the drills. They want to bring in wood. Just giving a kid a sense of ownership a sense of responsibility as well as a good night's sleep is tremendous for them. They learn how to take care of things. They learn value.

 (CNN)French President Emmanuel Macron has asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet with heads of political parties and representatives of the so-called "yellow vests" in an attempt to defuse tensions that erupted into violent protests over the weekend.Around 36000 people took part in protests across the country on Saturday but while the turnout was lower than the previous two weekends protesters clashed with police torching cars erecting roadblocks and burning barricades. The unrest has transformed from dissent over rising gas prices and eco-taxes into a broader demonstration against Macron his government and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.Speaking on France's Europe 1 radio Sunday spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the government was considering "all options" to prevent "serious outbursts of violence" including introducing a state of emergency.Griveaux said that between 1000 and 1500 people joined Saturday's demonstrations "only to fight with the police to break and loot." He added that those protesters "have nothing to do with the yellow vests."Yellow vests or "gilet jaunes" refers to the high visibility vests drivers in France are required to keep in their cars for safety reasons should their cars break down.Almost 400 people were arrested in Saturday's riots and some are expected to appear in court as early as Monday. As part of his response Macron has asked the Ministry of the Interior to develop a policing plan to counter any further protests according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.  No date has yet been set for the meeting between Philippe and the yellow vests BFMTV reported.The protests were initially conceived in response to rising fuel prices. The cost of diesel has surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69) even hitting 1.53 euros in October according to UFIP France's oil industry federation.The price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil with Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October.Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran which crippled oil exports.Many protesters are angry with the president for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.President: Tributes to policeThe weekend saw the protests in the French capital descend into violence with buildings cars set alight and authorities say attacks on citizens.The city's famed Arc de Triomphe -- a flashpoint in Saturday's violent protests -- was also vandalized scrawled with slogans in support of the yellow vest movement and others criticizing Macron as the President "of the rich."Upon his return to Paris from the G20 meeting Macron immediately visited the war monument to "take stock of the damage" and pay tribute to the tomb of the unknown soldier at its base CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.  He also met with police officers and firefighters who worked to contain the protests.Macron also held an emergency security meeting with top officials on Sunday. In a written statement he paid tribute to law enforcement and rescue teams who "showed unrelenting bravery throughout the day and evening" according to a release from the French Presidency.The statement also said that Macron "stressed the importance of judicial follow-up so that none of the acts committed remains unpunished."Arrested rioters to face 'immediate trial'French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said that the unrest was "absolutely unacceptable" but added that she would not yet recommend announcing a state of emergency stressing that there were "alternatives" without elaborating what else was being considered."When there are not only defacements that are absolutely unacceptable in our republic I think of what happened at the Arc de Triomphe when there are fires not only cars -- there have been 55 vehicles burned but also buildings that have been burned when there are attacks on people including I think a rape these are elements that cannot be acceptable in our republic."Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz alleged that among the protesters were people from across the country who had descended upon Paris with the express intent of causing trouble. He added that authorities would crack down hardest on those who had joined the street demonstrations explicitly carry out violent acts."There are varied profiles but there are definitely profiles of people who have come from the provinces all over France obviously to carry out acts of violence and it is to these people that the criminal response I will say will be the strongest.",World
 (CNN)Age cannot wither him -- whatever a courtroom might rule. Dutchman Emile Ratelband insists his quest to turn the clock forward on his birth certificate is not over despite a judge on Monday dismissing his request to legally become a younger man. The 69-year-old father-of-seven had applied to legally have two decades shaved off his age comparing his request with those from people seeking to switch their gender.The bizarre exercise was motivated by Ratelband's desire to make himself more attractive to members of the opposite sex on Tinder and other dating apps. Being younger would also boost his job prospects he argued. But Judge M. Van der Linde at the Court of Gelderland in Arnhem in the eastern Netherlands ruled that the issue was not just one of identity but also the "rights and obligations" that are connected with age -- such as the right to vote marry drink alcohol and drive. Such limits would "lose their meaning" if people were allowed to change their age at will the court ruled. In addition wiping 20 years of a person's life would also "imply that the 20 years in which [the applicant] did live would disappear in the registers" -- thereby bringing into question any qualifications gained in that period or indeed spouses and children accrued. Nevertheless Ratelband sounded anything but deflated following the ruling. "We plan to appeal right away" the self-defined positivity guru told CNN. Ratelband employed a lawyer to represent him 18 months ago. But mounting legal fees do not appear to be a concern. "This is about my consciousness and my free will" he told CNN. "I can choose my own life and my own holiday and my own name and my own gender so why can't I choose my own age? I say the government has to adjust to this."Ratelband insists he will ultimately take his fight as far as the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.He claims to have "more people with me than against me" having received messages of support from around the world. His family have also been supportive he said."My younger kids think it's great because they are nine and 11 and they say 'Pappa we love it when you go with us to school and play in the playground' so they don't see why I can't make it official. "My older son is 42 and he says 'when you become 49 you will be more like a big brother than a father to me.' But I say that's OK as most people think I'm your big brother and not your father anyway.",World
 (CNN)Joel Embiid's career has been dizzying. In three short years he moved from playing amateur basketball in Cameroon to the NBA.Last year he signed a $148 million contract spanning five seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers. Embiid is now one of the NBA's leading players leading his team to the playoffs for the first time in half a decade. But his journey from rookie to bona fide professional was anything but easy. Biggest challengesThe initial adaptation following his move to the United States was tough Embiid says with language proving a significant obstacle for him. "The biggest challenge when I moved to the States first of all I did not know how to speak English so it was hard" he explains. "I couldn't communicate with anybody. I remember even when I started playing over there my teammates were making fun of me for some reason but I was also lucky to have a couple guys on the team or in school that spoke English and French" says Embiid. "So every time I didn't understand anything they would come explain it to me and we were kind of like a big family."  "I always say my life is a movie because everything happened so fast" Embiid says of his rapid rise. The son of an Army chief and a disciplinarian mum Embiid grew up in Cameroon's capital Yaoundé and didn't start playing basketball until he was 16.He was discovered at a basketball camp in the city by NBA star and fellow Yaoundé native Luc Mbah a Moute who has come to be a bit of a mentor to Embiid.Things could have been different for Embiid who played football and volleyball as a child but he credits Basketball Without Borders - an annual instructional basketball camp organized by the NBA and FIBA globally - for giving him the opportunity to take the nascent steps in his professional career in 2011."Going back to 2011 when I was 16 I started playing and then five months later I was here [in the U.S.]. I ditched camp and I came here. I was shy" says Embiid. "I wasn't as good as everybody else but still tried. I ended up getting a scholarship to go to the state but you can say Basketball Without Borders played a huge role because that was the whole position that I wanted that I needed and I got it. And I'm thankful for that."Aiming higherIn the 2017 to 2018 season Embiid who is 24 years old was named in the NBA All-Star team for the first time in his career.  The goal he says now is to aim higher this new season. "We had a pretty good run last year. We could have gone farther than we did but this year we got our eyes on the championship. So you know just going to the finals and competing for that title is going to be great." This past summer he spent time in Johannesburg tutoring young girls and boys for Basketball Without Borders' camp and in China with the 76ers to unearth talented youngsters. Embiid aims to become the best player in the NBA not only for himself but for the entire African continent. "I'm working I'm on my way to become the best player in the NBA. And I think it will be great to say that an African is the best player in the whole world so I'm working towards that goal." Becoming the best player in a league with an array of the world's best players or winning the NBA title will not come easy and Embiid  knows this. 'Hard work pays off'He describes "the process" a principle he applies to basketball and life in general. It's a principle of hard work and patience. "The process is everything. It's a long story but the process is about you know we've gone through a lot. Like last year we won 52 games. Two years before that we won 10 games. And that's what the process is about" Embiid says. "The process applies to everything in life. Everything you have going on as long as you put in the work you going to be all good" he continued. "Hard work pays off." Embiid is now a role model for young kids in Africa and he wants them to have the opportunities Basketball Without Borders offered to him seven years ago. He has started a foundation back home in Cameroon run by his parents to help orphanages and people in need. But despite his worldwide acclaim Embiid sometimes misses the little pleasures of home. "I have a lot of great people around me in Philadelphia but you know you can never go wrong when it comes to your dad and mum. "Obviously you miss them and your siblings. That and the food. The food in Cameroon is great so sometimes I do miss it.",World
 (CNN)A leading journalist and vocal critic of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has surrendered to a Manila court after arriving back in the country to fight tax charges that were filed in her absence. Maria Ressa the CEO of Philippine news site Rappler presented herself to court with a bail application that was approved guaranteeing her freedom until her next court appearance scheduled for December 7.Ressa and her company were formally indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion last week charges critics say are politically motivated and designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country. The formal accusations bring with them a potential 10-year prison term under Philippines tax law.In a statement on Monday Ressa said that the charges were "a clear case of harassment.""I surrendered to the court this morning went though the process of what a criminal would go through and filed bail without surrendering my right to question the Pasig court's jurisdiction over this tax case" she said. Ressa's lawyer Francis Lim confirmed to CNN that she posted Php60000 (about $1100) bail and was free to leave the court. He added that an arraignment was set for Friday."We will file a motion to quash the indictment and defer the arraignment" Lim said.Ressa an award-winning journalist who previously served as a CNN bureau chief in Manila has defended Rappler's ownership structure as "100% Filipino" and maintained the charges against her company are politically motivated. "I've long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.' The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities. I am definitely not a stockbroker" Ressa told CNN after news of the charges broke.Duterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malacanang Palace his official residence over their coverage of his administration.Thorn in Duterte's side Ressa arrived back in Manila Sunday night amid fears that she could be subject to immediate arrest but was able to leave the airport with the rest of the Rappler team. Upstart news site Rappler has become an indispensable source of information both for the international media and readers in the Philippines for its coverage of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal war on drugs.Carlos Conde Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch said Monday that "the charges filed against Rappler and its editor and founder Maria Ressa are politically motivated and part of the Duterte administration's campaign to harass threaten and intimidate critics.""This is not surprising behavior by the administration but is nonetheless abominable" he said in a statement. In a press conference Monday Philippine presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo denied that the charges against Ressa and Rappler were politically motivated. "It's a question of tax evasion. You violate tax laws and then you'll be prosecuted" he told reporters according to Rappler. "We have repeatedly said that we've never and will never interfere with the function of the judiciary. If the judiciary finds probable cause then we'll have to respect the law on the matter. Ms. Ressa is entitled to legal remedies under the law."Brad Adams Asia director for Human Rights Watch earlier said the case sent "a chilling message to journalists and human rights activists (in the Philippines) that they will be targeted for exposing his murderous campaign." 'Ridiculous' chargesIn January the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.Philippines officials claim Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar. Rappler said five cases were formally filed against Ressa and Rappler Holdings in two courts. At the time the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called the charges a "direct assault on freedom of the press." The rights group Amnesty International meanwhile claimed it was "an alarming attempt to silence independent journalism."Ressa was overseas when the charges against Rappler were first announced but she vowed to return to the Philippines and fight them even if that meant doing so from a prison cell. "In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are what our identity is and for our young reporters who are on the ground how clear and necessary our mission is today" Ressa told CNN last month."Our democracy is in transition ... the mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now and we'll continue doing these stories."CNN's Joshua Berlinger and Euan McKirdy contributed reporting. ,World
 (CNN)Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has denied claims that he died and was replaced by a clone calling the speculation "ignorant rumors."Buhari tweeted on Sunday that he addressed the reports while at a meeting in Poland."One of the questions that came up today in my meeting with Nigerians in Poland was on the issue of whether I've been cloned or not" Buhari said. "The ignorant rumors are not surprising -- when I was away on medical vacation last year a lot of people hoped I was dead."Buhari spent long periods in London receiving medical treatment in 2017 on one occasion leaving Nigeria for more than three months.His absence prompted intense speculation in the country about the President's health and many false reports circulated online saying he had died.On Instagram and Facebook Sunday the President said the belief that he had died had prompted people to reach out to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo asking to be his deputy."That embarrassed him a lot; we discussed it when he visited me while I was convalescing" Buhari said. "I can assure you all that this is the real me. Later this month I will celebrate my 76th birthday. And I'm still going strong!"Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said on Facebook that a Nigerian at a meeting in Krakow on Sunday had asked Buhari if he was real or "the much talked about 'Jubril from Sudan' -- his supposed double" -- prompting the President to affirm his identity. Shehu said Buhari was in Poland to attend the UN Climate Change Conference COP24.Buhari was elected President of Nigeria Africa's largest economy and top oil producer in 2015.The former general became President in his fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985.Buhari was among military strongmen who dominated Nigeria decades ago. A military coup brought him to power in 1983 and another military coup toppled him two years later.,World
 (CNN)Images and stories from Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal war on drugs have shocked audiences worldwide as bodies have stacked up in cities across the country many of them victims of extrajudicial and vigilante killings. While the government has hardly been shy about its intention to go after both dealers and users hard data on the number of killings has often been tough to come by. One indispensable source of information both for the international media and readers in the Philippines has been the upstart news site Rappler which is now facing a reckoning with the government it has been a dogged check upon.Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and her company were formally indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion last week charges critics say are politically motivated and designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country.The formal accusations bring with them a potential 10-year prison term under Philippines tax law.On Sunday evening Ressa landed in Manila to fears that she could be arrested at the airport. She was not arrested at the airport but confirmed to reporters in the arrival hall that a warrant of arrest had been issued. Ressa said she was "ready to post bail and do what our lawyers will advise."Ressa's lawyer Francis Lim told CNN that Ressa left the airport with the rest of the Rappler team adding that they would "voluntarily surrender Maria to the court and ask it to set her free by posting bail which is a constitutionally guaranteed right under our legal system."'Ridiculous' chargesIn January the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.Philippines officials claim Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar.At the time the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called the charges a "direct assault on freedom of the press."

"I've long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.' The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities. I am definitely not a stockbroker" Ressa told CNN Thursday after news of the charges broke.Shawn Crispin CPJ Southeast Asia representative said the charges were a "blatant form of legal harassment and underline President Rodrigo Duterte's desperate attempt to stifle its critical reporting on his government." Duterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malacanang Palace his official residence over their coverage of his administrationBrad Adams Asia director for Human Rights Watch said the case sent "a chilling message to journalists and human rights activists (in the Philippines) that they will be targeted for exposing his murderous campaign." Duterte's drug warAt least 5000 people have been killed as a result of Duterte's drug war his landmark and most controversial policy. That figure is the official police count however and opposition lawmakers and rights groups estimate the true death toll could be in the tens of thousands. Those killed have included children and innocents as well as ordinary drug users and criminals executed extrajudicially. Among Philippines media Rappler in particular has focused on the human toll of the drug war and often contested the official death counts put out by the government under the social media campaign #RealNumbersPH a self-described effort to counter what it calls a "false narrative" on the war on drugs.This has attracted criticism from both supporters of the President and Duterte himself who has long had an uneasy relationship with the press since before he was elected in a landslide in May 2016. Ahead of his inauguration Duterte defended the notoriously high fatality rate for journalists working in the Philippines as sometimes justified and accused the media of being corrupt. "Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination if you're a son of a bitch" Duterte said in comments that were swiftly denounced by press groups. "Freedom of expression cannot help you if you have done something wrong." As many as 12 journalists were killed in the first two years of the Duterte administration higher than under any other president during a similar period according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). In the latest Press Freedom Index the Philippines fell six places to 134th of 180 countries with the report's authors warning that the "dynamism of the media has ... been checked by the emergence of a leader who wants to show he is all powerful."A dangerous jobJournalists who push back against the official narrative on the drug war both in the Philippines and overseas have faced online harassment from supporters of Duterte who organize on Facebook and other platforms to go after media critical of the President. Ressa has previously called out the effect of Facebook in enabling the spreading of disinformation and attacks against journalists online saying this has become a key policy for the Duterte administration. "We were the first two-and-a-half years before the United States started talking about disinformation we saw because of our partnership with Facebook we saw these exponential attacks on social media that began in July of 2016 the same month that the drug war began" she told ReCode last month. "In August of 2016 I gave that data to Facebook and I said this is really alarming. These people are targeting anyone who attacks who asks questions about the drug war. The drug war began in July of 2016. It's targeting journalists. It's targeting anyone who's perceived to be critical of President Duterte. Those attacks are heinous. It brings out the worst of human nature."While Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in spreading disinformation in the US and Europe the social network has also been roundly criticized for not doing enough to police its platform in Asia with both Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp accused of allowing hateful and dangerous content to be shared in countries such as Myanmar and India.Ressa was overseas when the charges against Rappler were first announced but she has vowed to return to the Philippines and fight them even if that means doing so from a prison cell. "In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are what our identity is and for our young reporters who are on the ground how clear and necessary our mission is today" Ressa told CNN last month."Our democracy is in transition ... the mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now and we'll continue doing these stories."CNN's Joshua Berlinger and Euan McKirdy contributed reporting. ,World
Paris (CNN)The French government is considering "all options" to control protests against rising fuel prices that have turned violent in Paris over the last three weeks a spokesman said Sunday.  Speaking on France's Europe 1 radio spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the government is thinking about steps to prevent "serious outbursts of violence" including introducing a state of emergency. More than 400 people were arrested and 133 injured in Paris on Saturday in clashes between police and protesters with the "gilets jaune" or "yellow vest" movement who are protesting rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport.An estimated 36000 people demonstrated in Saturday's protests across the country marking the third consecutive week of such demonstrations according to the French Interior Ministry. About 53000 participated last week and about 113000 the week before.Griveaux said that between 1000 and 1500 people joined Saturday's demonstrations "only to fight with the police to break and loot." He added that those protesters "have nothing to do with the yellow vests."Footage shared by French police on Saturday showed a few demonstrators striking a police vehicle and smashing its windshield. Other videos captured burning cars and police firing tear gas to disperse protesters.French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner had mentioned a state of emergency Griveaux said.Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told reporters at a Sunday press conference those involved in Saturday's protests would face "a very firm response from the criminal justice system." Some will be brought up for trial as soon as Monday according to the minister.Asked about the possibility of a state of emergency Belloubet said "I am not sure we have reached that stage quite yet. I think there are other options." French President Emmanuel Macron held an emergency meeting with top officials on Sunday just hours after returning from the G20 summit in Argentina. In a statement Macron paid tribute to law enforcement and rescue teams who "showed unrelenting bravery throughout the day and evening." Macron also "stressed the importance of judicial follow-up so that none of the acts committed remains unpunished" the statement added. Tensions risingRising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide.But the protests have evolved into a broader demonstration against Macron his government and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran which crippled oil exports.Many protesters are angry with Macron for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.The violent protests and vandalism in Paris have "absolutely nothing to do with the peaceful demonstrations of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent" Macron said on Saturday at a news conference in Buenos Aires where he was attending the G20 summit."No cause justifies that security forces are attacked shops pillaged public or private buildings set on fire pedestrians or journalists threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is sullied" Macron said.Those responsible will be identified and taken to court he added. Upon his return to Paris on Sunday Macron immediately visited the capital's Arc de Triomphe -- a flashpoint in Saturday's violent protests --  to "take stock of the damage" and pay tribute to the tomb of the unknown soldier at its base CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.He also met with police officers and firefighters who worked to contain the protests BFMTV said.

 (CNN)It's pretty obvious that air conditioning is a necessary technology. Living in stifling heat isn't just uncomfortable it's dangerous which makes the fact that air conditioning is bad for our environment a difficult pill to swallow. After all you can't just give it up like plastic straws or enormous SUVs. So the Rocky Mountain Institute along with  India's Department of Science and Technology and Mission Innovation is offering $3 million to the air conditioning genius who can solve this problem. It's called the Global Cooling Prize and it's designed to find a more environmentally friendly solution to the growing demand for more A/C. Oh and the prize's ambassador is famed billionaire philanthropist Richard Branson. According to a report compiled by the backers of the prize the number of room air conditioning units is set to triple over the next 30 years -- ballooning from a current 1.2 billion units to 4.5 billion units by 2050. This the report claims will have a serious impact on global warming and could increase the global temperature by 0.5˚C by 2100. Ironically that outcome increases the demand for air cooling units. "Our planet is getting hotter" the Global Cooling Prize's website says. "Already 30 percent of the world's population is exposed to potentially dangerous heat conditions; by 2100 up to three-quarters could be at risk. Affordable cooling is becoming a global necessity allowing for increased productivity positive health outcomes and accelerated economic development."To claim the $3 million (a reward which pales in comparison to solving a serious global environmental problem) teams who enter the global competition have to fill a series of tall orders. According to the Prize's website the solution designed for a tropical or sub-tropical home will need to:have one-fifth of the climate impact of existing air-cooling techoperate under specific material consumption and maintenance guidelinesbe affordable. If you think you're up for the task preliminary applications are due in June 2019. Organizers say they will announce the finalists in November 2019 and award the prize in late 2020.,World
Jerusalem (CNN)Israeli police said on Sunday that there is enough evidence to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a third corruption investigation.According to a police statement authorities found evidence of fraud bribery and breach of trust.  Police also said there is enough evidence to charge the Israeli leader's wife Sara Netanyahu with fraud receiving bribes and interfering with an investigation.The case known as Case 4000 is one of the largest facing the Israeli leader and his inner circle. It deals with the relationship between the Ministry of Communications -- then under Netanyahu -- and Israeli telecommunications firm Bezeq.Investigators say Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to Shaul Elovitch the controlling shareholder of Bezeq and Netanyahu's friend. In exchange prosecutors say Elovitch gave Netanyahu favorable news coverage in online news site Walla! News which is owned by Elovitch.Police say there is enough evidence to charge Elovitch with bribery interfering with an investigation and financial crimes.Both Netanyahu and Elovitch have denied any wrongdoing. In response to the police statement Netanyahu said "The police recommendations against me and my wife do not surprise anyone. These recommendations were decided and leaked before the investigation had even begun. The police recommendations have no legal standing.""There was nothing because there is nothing" he concluded. Corruption probes building against NetanyahuPolice have already said there is enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud bribery and breach of trust in two separate cases. A final decision whether to prosecute lies with Israel's Attorney General. In Case 1000 Netanyahu is suspected of having received gifts from businessmen overseas totaling 1 million shekels (approximately $280000) including cigars champagne jewelry and more from 2007 through 2016.The second case called Case 2000 involves conversations Netanyahu had with Arnon Mozes the owner of one of Israel's leading newspapers Yedioth Ahronoth which is regularly critical of the Prime Minister.In the conversations which became public through transcripts leaked in Israeli media Netanyahu allegedly discusses limiting the circulation of Yedioth Ahronot's biggest competition in favor of more favorable coverage. Both Netanyahu and Mozes have said they were not serious discussions; rather they each claim they were trying to expose the other's lack of trustworthiness.Sara Netanyahu faces her own probe The Prime Minister's wife Sara Netanyahu was charged in July with fraud and breach of trust in a separate investigation alleging misuse of state funds at the couple's official residence.Prosecutors say Sara Netanyahu used state money to pay for $100000 worth of meals at the prime minister's residence. She also illegally paid approximately $10000 for private chefs prosecutors said.Her lawyers slammed the indictment in July describing it as "false and hallucinatory. There was no fraud no breach of trust or any other felony."Opposition demands Netanyahu resignFollowing the latest statement from police on Sunday opposition politicians once again called on Netanyahu to resign.Tzipi Livni the former Foreign Minister said "Netanyahu has to go before he takes down law enforcement authorities in order to save himself. The people of Israel deserve clean leadership.""A prime minister with so many criminal cases around him cannot continue in his job and must resign" said Avi Gabbay the head of the Labor party.Netanyahu has the backing he needs... for nowDespite the ongoing criminal investigations which began a year and a half ago Netanyahu has held on to the support of his Likud party and his coalition. Only the Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon who heads the Kulanu party has said he will withdraw support for Netanyahu if he is indicted. Under Israeli law Netanyahu does not have to resign until he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.The decision to indict the Prime Minister can only be made by the Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit who will now review the findings of the police investigation.,World
Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping has praised George H.W. Bush's role in helping to improve China-US relations in a tribute to the former president of the United States who died on Saturday at the age of 94.In comments made during a meeting with US President Donald Trump at the G20 Summit in Argentina Xi said that he was "greatly saddened" by the late president's passing describing him as "someone who made important contributions to the China-US friendship and relationship during his lifetime."Xi expressed his sympathies for the Bush family and asked Trump to convey a message of condolence.Bush is best remembered in China for his time in Beijing as the US' unofficial ambassador to the country in the mid-1970s. It was an experience that would go on to influence his foreign policy decision making and help steer US-China relations through several tumultuous decades.Known in Beijing as the "bicycle-riding envoy" on account of the many hours he spent cycling through the capital's narrow hutong alleyways with his wife Barbara Bush endeared himself to local residents with his down-to-earth practicality and apparent enthusiasm for Chinese life.As the US' chief diplomatic envoy in China during a period before the US had formally opened an official Beijing embassy Bush met with several key Chinese leaders including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping as well as numerous military and diplomatic heads. "There's no doubt Beijing sees him as the best friend China has ever had in the White House certainly in the category of Nixon" said Jeffrey Engel director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University referring to former US President Richard Nixon who opened relations with Communist China in 1972.Envoy to ChinaFollowing Nixon's historic visit to Beijing Washington established a US liaison office in the Chinese capital with a chief envoy to act as an unofficial ambassador in an attempt to help break the ice.Beginning in 1974 Bush arrived in the capital aged 50 as the second US envoy to Beijing during a period in which China had yet to fully emerge from decades of self-imposed isolation. "He thought the future lay in Asia and the future lay in China" said Engel of Bush's decision to accept the role in the Chinese capital.Bush had traveled to Beijing with the intention of meeting "the next generation of China's leaders" according to his diary. But although Bush twice met Chairman Mao Zedong more often than not he found his diplomatic efforts thwarted. "They are polite they are strong but they always talk about principle. And when they don't want to give an answer they just obfuscate and sit there. It's the most frustrating thing in the world" he wrote in his diaries during his stay in Beijing.But by the time he left in 1975 to take up the role of CIA director under the Ford administration Bush had developed a special appreciation for and understanding of the Chinese government Orville Schell director of the Asia's Society's Center on US-China relations told CNN."He did bond with the country. I think (after he left) he felt a certain custodial sense towards China" said Schell.Massacre in BeijingElected to the US Presidency in 1988 Bush took office at a time when relations between the United States and China were at an all time high as the two countries engaged in increasing levels of economic cooperation. But that would soon change when little over a year later the Chinese Communist Party ordered the military to clear pro-democracy protestors camping in the center of Beijing leading to hundreds if not thousands of deaths."Bush was president during the single most difficult moment of Chinese-American relations since the Korean War" said Engel who worked with Bush on editing and publishing his China diaries.The events of June 4 1989 provoked a massive outcry around the world. The Bush administration immediately moved to impose sanctions on the Chinese government including suspending arms sales and military exchanges.But behind the scenes Bush made the controversial decision to reach out to Beijing's then leader Deng Xiaoping to smooth relations following the brutal massacre an act which the Chinese government never forgot."My long history with Deng and the other leaders made it possible for us to work through the crises without derailing Sino-American relations" Bush wrote in the foreword to his China diaries in 2007.Bush secretly sent his national security adviser Brent Scowcroft on a mission to China in July 1989 to ensure diplomatic relations were maintained at a time when the world was rapidly isolating China.The diplomatic overture described by Schell as a "tough call" led to widespread outrage in the United States after it was first reported by CNN in July 1989.Declassified US State Department documents later revealed how Bush hoped to "manage short-term events in a way that will best assure a healthy relationship over time" a strategy seemingly guided by his recognition that China was too important a country to completely isolate."Deng Xiaoping never forgot that after 1989 when China's luck was really down and Deng was smarting from a terrible self-inflicted wound Bush came to the rescue" said Schell.Engel pointed out years later when Bush was looking to build consensus in the UN Security Council in 1991 for action against Iraq during the First Gulf War China didn't use its veto power against the United States.'I love the Chinese people'During one of Bush's dozens of post-presidency visits to China in 2006 Engel who was traveling with him said the former US leader's reception upon his arrival in the country was "amazing.""He was not greeted as a former President he was greeted as President ... He remarked at the time nowhere else in the world did they treat him with as much reverence as when he went to China" he said.Engel admits part of the grand reception was due to the fact Bush's son George was then in the White House. "(But) there's also no doubt they were treating him as a great old friend of China" he said.One of Bush's last visits to China was during the Beijing Olympics in 2008 where he told the Washington Post in a rare interview China was an important "friend" and "supporter" of the US.Schell said the Chinese people always had a soft spot for the first Bush president. "During that period in the liaison mission he got a sense of 'face' that if you are too direct in your criticisms (of China) you cause a loss of face and they never get over it" he said."Clinton had a little of that and Hilary certainly did and Obama did. And (Beijing) never warmed up to them."For Bush's party he made his feelings on China clear in the foreword to his China diaries which he wrote in 2007."I love the Chinese people. One of my dreams for our world is that these two powerful giants will continue working toward a full partnership and friendship that will bring peace and prosperity to people everywhere" Bush said.,World
Paris (CNN)More than 200 people were arrested and dozens were injured in Paris on Saturday after clashes erupted between police and protesters according to a police spokesman. The spokesman told CNN at least 92 people had been injured including 14 police officers after protesters with the "gilets jaune" or "yellow vest" movement took to the streets to demonstrate against rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport.Saturday's protests marked the third consecutive week of such demonstrations although with an estimated 36500 participants across the country they were smaller than those in weeks past according to the French Interior Ministry. Last week about 53000 participated and there were about 113000 the week before. French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on Twitter Saturday that 1500 "troublemakers" had infiltrated a group of about 200 peaceful protesters and had "come to fight" near the Champs Elysées in Paris. Footage shared by French police showed a few demonstrators striking a police vehicle and smashing its windshield. Other videos captured burning cars and police firing tear gas to disperse protesters.Rising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil. Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increased by more than 20% in the first half of the year from around $60 a barrel to $86.07 in early October. But the protests have evolved into a broader demonstration against French President Emmanuel Macron his government and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor. Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran which crippled oil exports.Many protesters are angry with Macron for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.The violent protests and vandalism in Paris have "absolutely nothing to do with the peaceful demonstrations of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent" said Macron at a news conference in Buenos Aires where he's attending the G20 summit. "No cause justifies that security forces are attacked shops pillaged public or private buildings set on fire pedestrians or journalists threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is sullied" Macron said. Those responsible will be identified and taken to court he added. Macron will be meeting with the French prime minister and the minister of the interior when he returns to Paris.

 (CNN)Mexico swore in leftist leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador known as AMLO Saturday before a crowd that included world leaders and a strong majority in both houses of Congress.López Obrador won a landslide victory in the July 1 presidential election and began his his six-year term promising to carry out a strong fight against corruption insisting that the issue has been Mexico's worst nightmare."Nothing has harmed Mexico more that the dishonesty of the rulers" he said.    During his swearing-in López Obrador reaffirmed his intentions to sell Mexico's official presidential plane and to not live in the presidential palace. He said he will receive 40% of his presidential salary. In an extraordinary move López Obrador also announced his intention to promote a recall referendum during his administration adding the promise that he "will never seek reelection."Promises also came with criticisms Saturday. López Obrador criticized the neoliberal model that has governed the Mexican economy in recent decades saying that such policy "has been a disaster."  López Obrador also criticized his unpopular predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto for introducing "harmful" economic strategies and announced immediate public investment to rescue state oil and electricity industries while proposing the creation of a special economic zone with lower taxes along Mexico's border with the United States. Peña Nieto leaves with one of the lowest approval levels of any of the presidents. The leftist leader thanked the United States for sending Vice President Mike Pence and first daughter Ivanka Trump to his inauguration stating that since winning the presidential election he has been treated respectfully by President Donald Trump. López Obrador also thanked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stating he would like to reach an agreement with both Canada and the United States to tackle immigration issues.At one point the ceremony turned disruptive after López Obrador acknowledged Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro causing loud protests from a group of legislators holding a banner with the inscription "Maduro you are not welcome" while chanting "dictator dictator." The feud lasted for a couple of minutes even as López Obrador continued saluting other dignitaries.

 (CNN)Attackers raped beat and robbed more than 100 women and girls in northern South Sudan over a 10-day period in November aid agency Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said.South Sudan the world's youngest country has been embroiled in civil conflict since 2013 with its civilian population paying a heavy price. South Sudan's president Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with rebel leaders in September but it is not yet clear if the agreement will hold.The unrest has driven nearly 4 million people from their homes according to UN figures with hunger and violence widespread."Women and young girls have been coming to the MSF clinic in Bentiu en masse over the past week after surviving horrific episodes of sexual violence" Ruth Okello an MSF midwife in South Sudan was quoted as saying in an MSF statement Friday."Some are girls under 10 years old and others are women older than 65. Even pregnant women have not been spared from these brutal attacks."The state minister for information in Northern Liech State where the attacks were reported told Reuters news agency that the accounts were not accurate."A rape of such a magnitude is not true" Lam Tungwar told Reuters. "We are a state (that) respects human rights and women's rights top our list." He added that incidents of violence would be dealt with in the local courts.MSF said its teams had provided emergency medical care and other assistance to 125 women in Rubkona county in the 10 days from 19 to 29 November 2018."In more than three years of working in South Sudan I have never seen such a dramatic increase in survivors of sexual violence arriving at our programs looking for medical care" said Okello."We treated 104 sexual and gender-based violence survivors in the first 10 months of this year and we have assisted 125 survivors in the past week alone."In addition to being raped the women were whipped and beaten with sticks and rifle butts the aid agency said. The attackers also stole their clothing shoes and anything of value MSF said and destroyed ration cards needed for food aid.The assaults came as more people are on the move in Rubkona county to try to reach food distributions in the area the aid agency said. Women are walking in groups for safety but are still being confronted by increasingly larger groups of aggressive attackers.The head of the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan on Wednesday called for an end to violence against women in the country as part of a global campaign."Here in South Sudan women and girls have suffered immensely because of the ongoing conflict" said David Shearer. "I've spoken to many of them who have been subject to sexual violence including rape. This must stop.",World
 (CNN)The story of humankind may need some editing.A collection of 2.4-million-year-old stone tools has been found in Algeria throwing into question the long-held theory that humanity emerged in East Africa.  The discovery of the 250 tools found alongside 296 animal bones suggests early humans were butchering meat in North Africa about 600000 years before scientists had thought they arrived in the region.It was previously believed that early humans known as hominins originated and stayed in East Africa for hundreds of millions of years before beginning to move across the continent. But the new discovery "shows that our ancestors ventured into all corners of Africa not just East Africa" Mohamed Sahnouni who led the project and detailed the findings in the journal Science said in a statement."The evidence from Algeria changes the earlier view that East Africa was the cradle of humankind. Actually the whole of Africa was the cradle of humankind" he added.The findings were made at the Ain Boucherit site near the city of Setif about 200 miles east of Algeria's capital Algiers.They resemble similar tools known as Oldowan which had previously only been found in the east of the continent and predate other tools found nearby in the north by at least 600000 years.Researchers from Algeria France Spain and Australia were involved in the project which involved 25 years of excavations.  Further discoveries possible"The effective use of sharp-edged tools at Ain Boucherit suggests that our ancestors were not mere scavengers" says Isabel Cáceres of Spanish archaeological organization IPHES who was involved with the project. "It is not clear at this moment whether they hunted but the evidence clearly shows that they were successfully competing with carnivores and enjoyed first access to animal carcasses" she adds.East Africa hasn't yet lost its status as the cradle of humanity -- earlier tools dating back at least 2.6 million years have previously been found in that part of the continent.But the authors made the tantalizing prediction that even older relics could still be uncovered near the site in Algeria potentially opening up new avenues in the search for the origin of our species."Now that Ain Boucherit has yielded Oldowan archaeology estimated to 2.4 million years ago Northern Africa and the Sahara may be a repository of further archaeological materials" they write."We suggest that hominin fossils and Oldowan artifacts as old as those documented in East Africa could be discovered in North Africa as well" they add.'Multiple origin scenario'While no human remains were found at the dig the tools and animal bones showed strong evidence of human activity.Some of the bones featured cut marks indicating an early form of butchery the authors wrote.The discovery could indicate a "multiple origin scenario" where humans were making and using tools in different locations across the continent at the same time they added.Alternatively it could mean that a "rapid expansion of stone tool manufacture" took place in the early days of humankind's existence. Stone tools were found in China earlier this year that dated back 2.12 million years.The archaeologists behind that project said their finds suggested that early humans moved out from East Africa and into what is now Asia.The latest findings could tell a similar story if earlier remains in North Africa are not found. But they would imply that humans were moving west as well as east from their birthplace. ,World
 (CNN)Human Rights Watch has called on Philippine authorities to drop criminal charges against the news website Rappler and its editor Maria Ressa criticizing the legal action against them as politically motivated. The international rights watchdog accused the government of using tax laws "to muzzle prominent critics of President Rodrigo Duterte and his 'war on drugs.'"Rappler said five cases were formally filed against Ressa and Rappler Holdings in two courts. Philippine officials say some of the charges stem from Rappler and Ressa failing to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar.Tax evasion carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence and fines in the Philippines."The Philippine government is targeting Rappler and Maria Ressa for their dogged reporting on Duterte's murderous 'drug war'" said Brad Adams Human Rights Watch's director for Asia."This attempt to silence a highly regarded news website is just the latest example of the administration's contempt for free and vibrant news media."Ressa an award-winning journalist who previously served as a CNN bureau chief and Rappler's lawyers maintain the charges have to do with the website's critical coverage of Duterte. The President has waged a brutal crackdown on the sale and use of drugs across the Philippines since he took office in 2016 carrying out extrajudicial killings that several rights groups have said could amount to crimes against humanity.Journalists who have covered the Duterte's anti-drug campaign critically have reported harassment and intimidation. Human Rights Watch said he and other senior administration officials have "denounced threatened and demonized journalists.""As Duterte has imposed an increasingly authoritarian rule he has shown unrelenting hostility to Rappler and other critical Filipino media that are a check on his abuse of power" Adams said. "The Philippines' allies and friends should denounce these attacks and support efforts to defend press freedom and human rights in the country."Ressa told CNN on Thursday after news of the charges against her emerged that she had "long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.'""The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities. I am definitely not a stockbroker." This is not the first time Rappler has been in the crosshairs of Philippine authorities. In January the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.,World

 (CNN)Another day another alarming report about how climate change is not a future problem but rather one that is having severe effects all over the planet now. This time the report comes from the World Meteorological Organization an intergovernmental organization of 191 national meteorological services such as the US National Weather Service the UK Met Office and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The past four years have the been the hottest on record going back to 1850 the report says with the 20 hottest years on the list all occurring in the past 22 years.  Global temperatures for January through October of this year have been 0.98 degrees Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average from 1850-1900 (the period before human-emitted greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere to the point at which they began warming the planet). 2018 was not as hot as the previous three years owing to the presence of La Niña a cooling of the tropical waters in the Pacific Ocean that tends to bring down the global temperature; 2015 and 2016 had a strong El Niño that added to the globe's warming trend.The past five years have been 1.04 degrees Celsius above average which means we are more than two-thirds of the way to the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal set by the Paris Climate Agreement in December 2017."These are more than just numbers" World Meteorological Organization Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova said. "Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water to the extinction of animals and plants to the survival of coral reefs and marine life."Last month a dire report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the world's scientific authority on climate change said we could reach the 1.5 degree mark as soon as 2030 without immediate and unprecedented changes in our lifestyle and energy sources and it warned of the worsening impacts from heat waves droughts sea level rise and food shortages as temperatures climb.Thursday's "State of the Climate Report in 2018" from the World Meteorological Organization once again shows that these impacts are here and will only get worse."We are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases" Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said a fact that was proved just Wednesday when a separate UN report on global climate emissions found that the world's nations are woefully short of their goal to keep climate change below 2 degrees Celsius."Greenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if the current trend continues we may see temperature increases of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources the temperature rise will be considerably higher" he said.Warming is worsening world hungerClimate extremes are hitting the agriculture sector particularly hard threatening to reverse gains in the fight to end malnutrition the latest report said.In 2017 the number of undernourished people rose to 821 million ending a prolonged decline.Severe droughts aided by a strong El Niño in 2015-16 as well as numerous other extreme weather and climate events contributed to the rise according to the report. Africa's food security and malnutrition was the hardest-hit by climate events in 2017 affecting 59 million people in 24 countries; globally 39 countries remain in need of external assistance for food. Notable climate and weather events in 20182018 has featured several major weather and climate events and although individual weather extremes are not solely caused by climate change these types of events are expected to become more numerous more widespread and more destructive as global temperatures rise.Unprecedented heat and dry conditions in Europe which saw temperatures in the 30s Celsius (90s Fahrenheit) all the way up to Scandinavia and the Arctic Circle led to heavy crop losses in many countries.Germany lost 43% of its maize and 21% of its potato crop with production losses likely to be in the billions of euros the report said. South America also experienced crippling drought with Argentina seeing the worst losses in agriculture estimated at US $3.9 billion. It has been an active year for tropical cyclones around the planet as well with all four of the ocean basins in the Northern Hemisphere seeing more storms (70) than normal (53) for this point in the year.The Northeast Pacific basin has seen record activity tallying the highest "accumulated cyclone energy" (a measurement to express the destructive potential of a tropical cyclone that when added together for all storms gives a value for the overall year's tropical activity) in its 29 named tropical systems in 2018.,World
Mariupol Ukraine (CNN)As Maxim Nosenko strides the decks of one of Ukraine's moored naval gunships frozen in a biting chill that rips through the port of Mariupol he's left to contemplate Kiev's unlikely response to the apparent bid by Moscow to annex the sea behind him: inactivity.Ukraine's navy here has been told to stay in port at a heightened state of readiness in a bid to not further aggravate the Russian military who appear to have free rein in the Sea of Azov all the way down to the Kerch Strait."Our superiors stopped our moving and patrolling because of the situation" said Nosenko a spokesman for the Ukrainian navy. "Right now we are on a state of readiness to react to all situations."The broad concern here in an armed force that has fended off the massively better-equipped Russian military during a slow relentless four-year conflict is that this is the beginning of a new episode. That Moscow really seeks to control not just naval traffic in and out of the Sea of Azov but also the sea itself. The goal they worry is to dominate the Ukrainian coast between Russia proper and the Crimean peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. The peninsula is currently only reachable from Russia through an expensive bridge across the Kerch Strait. A land corridor would be a huge advantage.For now Ukrainian officials say Russia's measures extend to simply limiting traffic in and out of the sea. "Russian coast guard ships take under control the civilian ships going to our ports and take some time to check all documents" said Nosenko. "More than twenty ships are waiting on that side to proceed to our ports."Further along the coast the media are treated to a show of the strength that Ukraine's military has mustered in the last four years a display of attack helicopters strafing an empty field and anti-aircraft guns shooting a flare over the Azov coast. But it isn't going to change Moscow's plans in and of itself. What would is global unified condemnation but that's been limited. The commander of Ukraine's joint operation Sergei Naev told CNN: "I think that the American leader must say to our enemy to stops his aggression and stop it now."With 24 sailors still in Russian prisons and a vital sea route now seized it seems Kiev has found itself much more isolated than in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. The US has not led the world in further sanctions against Moscow and instead President Donald Trump has until his last-minute cancellation of their G20 meeting entertained a chummy one-on-one with Vladimir Putin. Ukraine has if you discount the countless rhetoric of "grave concern" echoing around European capitals been left to go it alone.Friday their response gained an edge when Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted that Russians aged 16 to 60 would be barred from entering Ukraine the most concrete measure taken yet by Kiev during the 30 days of the martial law they have declared. Poroshenko cited the fact that Russian citizens entered illegally in 2014 to foment the unrest in Crimea and the East. But these are two countries that have been symbiotic for decades and it'll hurt Ukrainians as much as Russians.Clearing leaves up from green areas near Mariupol's under-used railway tracks is a group of Ukrainian women in orange overalls who will probably add the ban on Russians to the list of things they blame their president for."If we had a normal president would women work like this in this kind of job?" asked Maria as she and her six colleagues raced towards the Biz Cafe near the rail tracks for a short and early lunch."I have relatives in Russia" interjected Elena. "We are Russian. I don't understand this kind of conflict."In the cutting chill Poroshenko appears to have taken the blame for the damage the war has done to their hard graft world while Putin has emerged cleaner stronger despite being to blame for the repeated invasions and the threat of another. "I don't know why [Trump] supports Poroshenko" said Elena.A third Anastasia said: "I have many Russian friends who worry for us like we worry for them. We need another good president."On a cliff top overlooking the idle port strolls Dimitry Ponomaryo a little breathless from the steep climb but his lungs full of the discontent caused by a crashing wartime economy here. "There is little work here and no one has paid us we don't have enough money. Russia's don't need to attack they won't invade."He added he thought sanctions would be toughened if Russia invaded but that Trump was not at present being that weak. "He should talk with Putin but also close the Bosphorus [Strait into the Black Sea] to the Russians and then we will see how they feel.",World
 (CNN)After spending 157 days at sea a 33-year-old man came ashore Sunday and became the first person to swim around the mainland of Great Britain according to Red Bull the company that documented his feat.Ross Edgley started the 1791-mile trek June 1 in Margate a coastal town in southeast England. On Sunday morning he returned to the same location and was met by 300 other people who swam the last half mile with him."I won't lie getting a tad emotional now knowing it's coming to an end" he posted on Instagram on Friday.For past five months Edgley has endured rough seas jelly fish stings sharks and icy waters. He never set foot on land throughout his journey and instead rested on a support boat between his six-hour swims according to Red Bull. During his breaks he slept on the boat fueled his body by eating up to 15000 calories a day and rolled out his tired muscles -  all while documenting his journey for social media. He and the company called his effort The Great British Swim.Edgley faced health issues ranging from chaffing around his neck from his wet suit and "salt mouth." That condition is caused by the buildup of salt on his tongue which made pieces of his tongue flake off. But nothing stopped him from completing his race.In August his path around Great Britain was recognized as the Longest Staged Sea Swim propelled only by muscle power (no flippers).Red Bull documented his journey since the beginning with weekly vlogs posted to their YouTube channel."It's my hope that people remember the Great British Swim as an example or experiment in both mental and physical fortitude" he said in a vlog posted by Red Bull on Thursday. ,World
Moscow (CNN)Ukraine will restrict the entry of Russian men aged between 16 and 60 in an effort to prevent Russia from forming "private armies" on its soil President Petro Poroshenko said Friday. Poroshenko cited fears of an invasion similar to Russia's seizure and annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 as the logic behind his latest security measures.The ban follows Kiev's imposition of 30 days of martial law in a handful of provinces. Tensions have soared between the two former Soviet Republics after Russian boats attacked and seized three Ukrainian navy vessels and 24 sailors in the Kerch Strait last weekend. A court in Crimea ordered all 24 sailors to be detained for two months earlier this week pending trial. On Thursday a number of the sailors were transferred to Moscow according to a lawyer for two of the sailors. CNN reached out to the detention center but did not receive a response. On Friday Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the entry ban on Russian men showed Kiev's "dysfunction" but stopped short of calling for a tit-for-tat retaliation."It's frightening to talk about mirrored response because if anyone even tries mirroring what's going on now in Kiev it can lead only to madness" Zakharova told reporters Friday. "The somersaults that we see in Kiev and in Ukraine in general show the complete dysfunction of the state of the state as an entity a consequence of the wild -- and it's impossible not to say premeditated -- movements of the country's leadership" she added. Questions over Putin's endgameFriday's security order is likely to make the lives of those residing in the border regions much more difficult. Ukraine and Russia are heavily interconnected; many residents have friends and family on the other side of borders.  Earlier this week Poroshenko said Russia appeared to be building its military presence along the border sparking further concerns that the long-simmering conflict is entering a new phase. "The country is under the threat of a full-scale war with the Russian Federation" Poroshenko said. There have also been reports of Russian missiles being moved in the aftermath of the standoff.The Russian military will deploy additional S-400 air-defense systems to Crimea Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday citing the head of the press service of Russia's Southern Military District Vadim Astafyev.The clash and subsequent aftermath has prompted fears that Russia may seek to control all entry and movement in the Azov Sea.Crisis casts shadow on G20Russia's use of force against Ukraine sparked widespread condemnation and the crisis is likely to loom large over the G20 summit in Argentina which began Friday. On Thursday US President Donald Trump abruptly called off a bilateral meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin due to take place on the sidelines of the two-day event. Trump blamed the cancellation on Russia's refusal to release the Ukrainian navy ships and sailors seized during last week's incident.While the decision was applauded in Kiev some tied the cancellation to the Trump's domestic political problems. Hours before Trump pulled the plug on the sit-down with Putin new allegations surfaced involving his former longtime attorney Michael Cohen once again prompting questions about Trump's financial ties to Russia.  "Was the provocation organized by Kiev in this region the real reason for cancellation?" Zakharova the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said in a press conference Friday Russian state news agency RIA reported. "Publicly we heard just such an explanation we took note of it. Is this a reality? I think that you still need to look for answers in the US domestic political situation. The dominant factor in making a decision is domestic political realities in the US" she suggested.The Kremlin also said it regretted the US administration's decision to cancel the meeting but left the door open to reschedule the appointment. "As far as Russian President Vladimir Putin is concerned he is ready for contacts with his US counterpart" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS on Friday.CNN's Radina George contributed to this report. ,World

Berlin (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel's plane was forced to turn around and make an unscheduled landing due a technical problem a government spokesman told CNN. Merkel was heading to Argentina for the G20.The plane has landed safely in Cologne the spokesman said. Merkel has had to reschedule some meetings due to the delay. An RTL reporter on board says they were flying over the Netherlands when they were told there had been an "electronic systems failure" and turned around to land at the Cologne airport. Reporters have been told the airplane is getting a replacement part.  Video from on board shows several fire engines surrounding the Airbus after it landed. The two-day summit kicks off tomorrow in Buenos Aires. ,World
Tijuana Mexico (CNN)Some migrants have been shuttled to the new shelter in Tijuana where "better" accommodations include a "roof and a dry floor" according to a Human Rights Watch researcher."Much better installations at the new shelter in #Tijuana. Migrants will have a roof and a dry floor to sleep tonight. But 45 minutes away by car from the border" researcher Jonathan  Pedneault tweeted late Thursday along with two stills of an empty facility.He followed that by saying "Less funny [sic] for the single men in the new #Tijuana shelter however - no lights" along with another photo of men gathered in a covered space lit with what appeared to be only flashlights or portable lights placed on the floor.  Earlier Thursday evening buses arrived at the primary shelter the crowded Benito Juarez Sports Complex to try to shuttle some of the 6000 Central American migrants housed there to the second facility -- located in the eastern part of the city in an area known as El Barretal.The shelter will house at least 3000 people said Rodolfo Olimpo a representative from Baja California state's Special Committee on Migration Issues. Preparations for the new shelter have been in the works for days officials said Thursday. Thousands of migrants have arrived in Tijuana in recent weeks. Many are traveling as part of so-called caravans large groups that trekked from Central America largely on foot.Tensions flared Sunday when a group of migrants rushed the border and US authorities fired tear gas. Since then the situation has calmed.But Tijuana's mayor says his city is still facing a humanitarian crisis as migrants camp out awaiting the chance to make an asylum claim in the United States. A sports complex near the border has become a makeshift shelter for more than 5000 migrants. That's at least triple its capacity and human rights groups describe conditions inside as unsanitary. They've accused US authorities of creating a crisis by limiting processing at ports of entry.US officials say limited resources and capacity mean they can only process a fraction of cases on the waiting list daily.A group of migrants said Thursday that they planned to begin a hunger strike to push for the United States to speed up the processing of asylum claims.CNN's Leyla Santiago and Rosalina Nieves reported from Tijuana.

Paris (CNN)In a Parisian suburb Myriam sits at her parents' dinner table the Shabbat candles flickering before her. Together with her husband and newborn son she takes stock of the painful week she's had. It's a regular conversation for many French Jews. Myriam who did not want to give her last name over fears for her own safety questions whether France is a country where her family can prosper a place they can still call home.   According to the Jewish Agency for Israel 55000 French Jews have left the country since the year 2000."I'm scared of the future of my baby here" Myriam told CNN. "I hope that he will have a future here and you know Jewish communities are a part of the history of France."Earlier this month the French government said that anti-Semitic acts had increased by 69% over the first nine months of 2018. The new statistics coincided with the announcement of a 5 million euro government fund to combat anti-Semitism in schools and a pledge to tackle online hate speech.A CNN/ComRes poll published earlier this week revealed that one out of five French adults between 18-34 said they'd never heard of the Holocaust.Frederic Potier the man charged with leading the government's plans to tackle anti-Semitism said the poll's findings were shocking. "I'm really surprised by this number because in our country... 20% is a lot" he said. When asked by CNN as to why the number was so high he answered: "I will not say that we don't have any problems yes we do. We have some problems some teachers have difficulties to teach the Holocaust."Arthur Reverchon a history teacher who works with children in Paris says Holocaust education is a large part of the program in secondary schools and often comes up in exams."The history curriculum taught to kids between the ages of 11-13 deals largely with the birth of Judaism. With regards to anti-Semitism in France the Dreyfus affair is on the curriculum in middle school (13-14) and in high school (16-17) this allows us to delve into the issue of anti-Semitism in France and in Europe. The Holocaust constitutes a large part of the program in secondary school.""On the whole I think the Holocaust is well taught in the curriculum and it's wrong to say it's difficult to teach the Holocaust in French schools particularly in the suburbs" Reverchon told CNN."I taught in three different schools all three were difficult and in the suburbs but I never had any difficulty teaching the Holocaust my students were always receptive. If there are examples and I'm not denying their existence they are globally isolated events."Violent attacks Since 2006 when Ilan Halimi a young Jewish man was kidnapped and killed 11 people have died in anti-Semitic attacks in France.In 2015 a gunman killed four people in a kosher supermarket in Paris as people watched the story unfold on television. Three years earlier four people including three young children were gunned down in an attack on a Jewish school in Toulouse shocking the country. In 2017 Sarah Halimi a 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman was murdered in her apartment dragged from her bed and thrown from the balcony in an anti-Semitic attack which shocked the nation.Earlier this year hundreds took to the streets to protest after Mireille Knoll an 85-year-old French Holocaust survivor was slain in her apartment in what French authorities have described as an anti-Semitic hate crime.That list of fatal attacks almost included Nathaniel Azoulay an 18-year-old Parisian who told CNN how he was attacked by a man wielding a saw after a traffic altercation. Azoulay says the man had been civil toward him initially. "He was talking to me normally but at some point his speech changed when he saw the kippah" said Azoulay referring to his head covering. The man's aggression prompted Azoulay and his brother to flee their car running as fast as they could toward safety. Though both trained in Krav Maga the self-defense system used by the Israel Defense Forces and taught in Jewish community centers in France neither could escape the assailant."He started hurling anti-Semitic insults 'f***king Jew you're gonna die on this road'" said Azoulay. "He wanted us to die... he stabbed my brother with the saw and my brother could not protect himself with his Krav Maga moves." Azoulay says he tried to save his brother who had been pushed to the floor with the saw aimed at his neck but a group of the attacker's friends arrived and surrounded the siblings."The attacker was shouting: 'They're f***ing Jews we can beat up come hit them'" said Azoulay. "We tried to run back to the car. He attacked me again with the saw on my back but I had a big jacket. His friends were going towards my brother and pushing him on the ground. I managed to grab the saw. I grabbed the sharp side so it cut my fingers and I had to get it stitched up at the hospital."Azoulay says the attack came to a halt only after the father of the attacker pleaded with his son to stop.   Azoulay's brother was injured in the attack and police investigated. But a trial has yet to begin.France which is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe also hosts a large Muslim community.The relationship between the two communities has deteriorated steadily as the politics of the Middle East has reverberated in France.It's visible in the working-class Parisian suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois which once had a thriving Jewish community. The community center and synagogue were once full. But a member of the community told CNN the numbers have dropped dramatically.  Fear has forced many to leave for other parts of Paris or in some cases leave the country altogether.Malika a local Muslim resident who didn't give CNN her last name says she is sad to see members of the Jewish community move away from the area but it doesn't surprise her. "They are right to be afraid because the conflict in Palestine has reached here and that's why we're in this situation" she said."When I see a Jew next to my place or on the street I say: 'We are the same family.' They have nothing to do with what's going on in Palestine. They are afraid for their children and that's crazy."The turning point Yonathan Arfi vice president of CRIF an umbrella body for Jewish groups in France says there have been "several hundred attacks" since 2000 with the nature of those attacks changing markedly.  He cites the start of the second intifada in the West Bank and Gaza in 2000 as the moment the attacks on the Jewish community began to change."Before it was graffiti on buildings now it ends up with (the) killing of people and terrorism so we see that the nature of anti-Semitism has changed dramatically" said Arfi.  "These attacks were committed by young people identifying with Palestinians considering Jews guilty of the things happening in the Middle East I would say." While traditional anti-Semitism is not a new phenomenon in France the government is battling against what has been coined as the "new anti-Semitism" which it says spills out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Potier says there is a divergence between both the "old" and "new" strains of anti-Semitism which are equally destructive. "What we call in France the new anti-Semitism is coming from radical Muslims but as I say every day the new anti-Semitism uses very old messages like the Protocol of the Elders of Zion the theory that Jews have money and power" Potier said. "... both are completely linked. There is a common point between the far-right and radical Muslims. "When you are talking about Jews and money for instance it is the same cliché it is the same stereotypes that are being used by these groups. So when you are educating people about religious beliefs what is Israel what is Zionism you are using the same tools."Hakim El Karoui a senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne who has previously worked for the French Ministry for Economy and Finance and has advised the government on anti-Semitism says the lack of familiarity between the two communities is a huge factor in creating tension.Increasing segregation between the communities is a dangerous reality that is leading to even less interaction and understanding between communities often prompting more tension he says. "What has happened in a lot of working-class neighborhoods is that where Arab and Jews once lived together the Jews have left" El Karoui told CNN. "They (the Jewish community) left Seine-Saint-Denis they went to the west side of Paris and therefore they don't know each other anymore" El Karoui said."I'm pretty worried about the deterioration of the situation and I think the best answer to this issue should obviously be coming from the government but also from the Muslim community."It needs to say out loud: 'You have no right to say this.' It needs to say 'You are wrong. You are making a mistake by saying this because in the end your words will come back against you.' The fact that there's a lot of silence on this topic is a problem."The government hopes its new plan can begin to tackle the roots of anti-Semitism within France.Earlier this month Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the mobilization of a national team tasked with educating children in schools across the country on the dangers of anti-Semitism.He also promised to make tackling online hate speech a national priority as well as introducing an anti-racism prize named after Halimi a 23-year-old tortured and murdered in an anti-Semitic attack in 2006. There are also plans for an online complaint procedure to allow users to register attacks with authorities. But For Myriam and her family the question of whether her son can live safely in the country of his birth remains a difficult one.The violence toward France's Jewish community scares her and while she says the government has tried to act she is clear that more needs to be done."For over 10 years the government makes efforts for sure in terms of legislation and policies but it's not enough" she says."The first priority is to recognize that the problem the heart of the problem it's the radical Islam. First name the problem. And then it's more education." CNN's Saskya Vandoorne in Paris contributed to this report.,World
Hong Kong (CNN)More than 200 runners have been disqualified from the Shenzhen half marathon after widespread cheating was uncovered following the race on November 25 Chinese state-run media Xinhua said.About 16000 people were estimated to take part in the race on Sunday just one of more than 1000 marathons being held across the country in 2018 alone.But just days later it was discovered that 258 runners had cheated during the annual event with some taking shortcuts while others hired people to run for them."We deeply regret the violations that occurred during the event. Marathon running is not simply exercise it is a metaphor for life and every runner is responsible for him or herself" event organizers said after the race.Video on traffic cameras caught runners brazenly crossing through a nature strip from one side of a highway to the other to significantly shorten their race by up to three kilometers (1.8 miles).In other cases according to Xinhua photos from the race showed two runners with the same number on their bibs.As a result of their actions competitors who wore fake bib numbers or hired replacement runners were banned for life from competing in the annual race while another 237 were banned for two years.Usually disqualifications at marathons worldwide are made on an individual basis with one or two runners accused of cutting corners or faking times.An article by People's Daily posted to social media after the announcement of the mass cheating called on competitors to "please respect the Marathon and respect sporting spirit."CNN's Serenitie Wang contributed to this article.,World
Belfast Northern Ireland (CNN)Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Brexit have "undermined" the Good Friday peace agreement Irish premier Leo Varadkar said Saturday."Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and is fraying the relationship between Britain and Ireland" Varadkar known as the Taoiseach told Irish state broadcaster RTE."Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship" he said. The Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998 helped end years of deadly sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.The terms of the Brexit agreement on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remain one of the key sticking points in Britain's ongoing negotiations with the EU ahead of the UK's expected withdrawal from the bloc in March. Varadkar's comments came a day after politicians from both Britain and Northern Ireland hinted that a deal on the divisive border issue could be close.Arlene Foster leader of the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP said Friday after meeting with UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab that she believes the UK is "close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland."But she added "Northern Ireland must not be carved into an arrangement which undermines the constitutional or economic integrity of the United Kingdom." The DUP has a parliamentary power-sharing deal with the British Conservative Party that helps prop up Prime Minister Theresa May's government in Westminster and has consistently pushed for no hard border on the island of Ireland. In a statement released Friday Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney called the meeting with Raab "very productive" adding that the two governments are "determined to see the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly up and running again as soon as possible."Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive has not sat since January 2017 with the DUP and Sinn Fein seemingly unable to reach any agreement."We also discussed future East-West co-operation post-Brexit and agreed that we will work together to ensure that Ireland and the UK's future relationship is safeguarded" Coveney said. Following his visit to Northern Ireland Raab said that he was confident the UK could reach a Brexit deal "that works for all communities" asserting that any deal reached with the EU "must avoid a hard border"  between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic."We will not accept any Brexit proposals that threaten the economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The deal we strike with the EU must avoid a hard border and work for all parts of the community in Northern Ireland" he said.CNN's Nada Bashir reported from London and journalist Peter Taggart from Belfast.,World
New York (CNN Business)General Motors has earned tens of billions of dollars in profit over the past decade. But the automaker has paid essentially no federal income tax to Washington since it came out of bankruptcy. And GM probably won't have to pay much in federal taxes for at least the next five years.GM isn't evading Uncle Sam. Federal law allows companies to use past losses to shield future profits from taxes. The tax break known by the wonky name "net operating loss carryforward" is one the most common tax breaks in corporate America. Most businesses lose money at some point. The tax break is designed to help struggling companies get back on their feet. GM is an extreme example. It suffered huge losses leading up to its 2009 bankruptcy. By 2010 it was again profitable and it has essentially been very profitable ever since.The company's finances have been in the news again over the last week after it announced plans to close plants and cut thousands of jobs. President Donald Trump immediately attacked GM arguing it should keep the plants open because of the taxpayer help it's gotten in the past. He vowed to cut off any subsidies it is still receiving.But for GM its ability to effectively bank past losses to reduce present and future tax bills is more valuable than any of those government programs including the net cost of the 2009 auto bailout and a federal tax credit for people who buy plug-in cars. According to corporate filings GM paid $18 million in federal taxes last year its largest tax bill since the bankruptcy. Despite the federal tax break the company paid millions in other kinds of taxes: $83 million in state and local and $552 million in foreign taxes last year for example.GM paid federal income tax in just three other years since 2010 totaling another $18 million. In most years it posted even larger credits not an expense for federal income taxes. Along the way GM posted total net income of $50 billion from 2010 through 2016 setting company profit records in several periods.In fact GM's only reported loss since 2009 was last year. And that was because it had to write down the future value of the tax break it gets from past losses. The Republican tax cut plan which reduced GM's future tax obligations means GM can't count on saving as much money going forward. Building up a storehouse of lossesGM's profitability in recent years is very different from its financial performance leading up to its bankruptcy. The company posted total net losses of $82 billion between 2005 and 2008 and its operating loss in 2009 came to more than $23 billion. That gave it an enormous buffer against its future tax bills.In February Charles Stevens who was then GM's chief financial officer assured investors that he expected the company to continue in "a very low cash taxpaying position ... for the foreseeable future" into 2022 or 2023. GM declined to comment for this story other than to confirm that Stevens' outlook is still accurate.At the end of last year GM still had $8.6 billion in future domestic tax breaks on the books.Allowing companies to reduce their tax bills after losing money is good policy said Tax Policy Center senior fellow Steve Rosenthal. Among other things it helps them to borrow money at better interest rates and helps them raise money from the stock markets since investors know the value of the tax break going forward. GM raised a then-record $20 billion from investors in 2010."Businesses report their net income annually which is somewhat arbitrary" Rosenthal said. "In order to tax net income over a business' life cycle we need to allow losses to carry forward."But the savings are huge. At the end of 2011 GM estimated it would end up saving $11.2 billion from the tax break from past losses.By comparison the federal government gave GM a $49.5 billion bailout to fund its turnaround. The Treasury Department got most of that back when it sold stock in GM that it held after the bankruptcy. Still taxpayers took a $10.6 billion loss on the bailout. In terms of other government assistance GM is among the companies that benefit from a $7500 tax credit that buyers get for purchasing plug-in cars. That tax break helps GM sell cars for a higher price. GM has sold nearly 200000 of them meaning the buyers' tax bills have been reduced by a total of $1.5 billion.The company also does get some research grants from government departments such as the department of energy. But those grants are no where near as valuable totaling tens of millions of dollars not billions.,Business
London (CNN Business)Royal Dutch Shell is giving its executives a powerful new reason to care about the environment. The Anglo-Dutch energy firm said Monday that it will establish short-term carbon emissions targets starting in 2020 after coming under pressure from investors. In an industry first it plans to link executive pay to hitting the targets. Major shareholders including the Church of England and Robeco have demanded that Shell do more to tackle emissions. They say its earlier goal of cutting carbon emissions by half by 2050 did not go far enough.Shell (RDSA) said in a statement that it would set carbon reduction goals that cover periods of three to five years. The targets will be set on an annual basis and run to 2050.The oil company did not set out specific carbon benchmarks on Monday. And it said that shareholders would not vote on changes to executive remuneration until 2020.Climate Action 100+ a group of 310 investors with over $32 trillion in assets under management said in a joint statement with Shell that it strongly supported the company in taking "these important steps." Shell made the announcement as the United Nations' annual talks on climate change got underway in Poland.Shell said it would be the first major energy company to link executive compensation and carbon goals. Crucially it's committing to cut emissions generated by both its activities and the products it sells."That Shell has now embedded its ambition in its remuneration policy offers confidence that Shell is really committed to it" said Corien Wortmann chair of the pension fund ABP.Moves by major corporations to reduce carbon emissions should help governments meet targets established under the Paris Climate Agreement which seeks to keep rises in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius.The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in October that the planet will reach the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius by as early as 2030 precipitating the risk of extreme drought wildfires floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. It said companies and governments must act faster.Emma Howard Boyd chair of the UK Environment Agency praised Shell on Monday for moving to set short-term targets."We hope that this unique joint statement between institutional investors and an oil and gas major will inspire other leaders to take bold action" she said in a statement. "We would encourage the rest of the sector to follow Shell's lead."Shell announced in 2016 that it would link greenhouse gas emissions to executive compensation. It isn't the only Big Oil company to come under pressure from investors over the environment. Last year US-based ExxonMobil (XOM) agreed to reveal the risks it faces from climate change and the global crackdown on carbon emissions.,Business
New York (CNN Business)The ceasefire between the United States and China has set off a celebration on Wall Street.The Dow soared more than 400 points early Monday before giving up most of those gains. It was up 150 points at midday. Investors were pleased that China and the United States reached a temporary trade truce. It's a big relief because the damaging trade war between the world's two largest economies was set to deepen in January. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 climbed more than 0.5% apiece. "A truce is definitely better than an escalation of hostilities" Kit Juckes strategist at Societe Generale wrote to clients on Monday. Juckes said that even though investors may doubt the substance of the US-China agreement "this morning's response reflects relief and a desire to pick up some last-ditch bargains."Not surprisingly investors piled back into companies that rely on China for a significant chunk of their sales. That includes tech giants like Apple (AAPL) Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) as well as industrial companies like Boeing (BA) Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE). Tiffany (TIF) jumped 4% while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) surged 9%. "The market is thrilled to get a little bit of a reprieve" said Amanda Agati co-chief investment strategist at PNC. "But it's early to say anything is done and to cross this worry off the list. There's still a long road ahead.The relief rally comes after the S&P 500 spiked nearly 5% last week its best since December 2011. That rebound was triggered by hopes of progress on the trade front and a speech by Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell that investors interpreted as a signal the central bank will not rush to raise interest rates."The China trade situation is the keystone in the arch of agita" said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The progress on talks with China means "now we have a very good chance of experiencing a Santa Claus rally" said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.It wasn't just US markets celebrating. Major indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai surged 2.5%. And markets in London Frankfurt and Paris climbed 1% or more. Commodities also raced higher. Copper and soybeans rallied. US oil prices boosted by hopes of an agreement by Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut output surged 4%. After meeting on Saturday US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold their fire on tariffs while they try to reach a trade deal. Trump agreed not to raise the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for now. Those tariffs had been scheduled to automatically rise to 25% on January 1. And China said it would be willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture energy and other US products. Still some analysts warned that the celebration on Wall Street could be short-lived. China and the United States now only have 90 days to sort out nagging trade issues that have been in contention for years if not decades. And the statements that emerged from the trade meeting lacked concrete details."The beefiest part of Saturday evening's meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi may well have been the local sirloin served for dinner" Nicholas Colas co-founder of DataTrek Research wrote to clients on Monday.Goldman Sachs economists said the most likely outcomes are that the truce gets extended after 90 days or that the trade war escalates. The investment bank sees just a 20% chance over the next three months of a comprehensive deal rolling back tariffs."The specter of higher and broader US tariffs remains" Goldman Sachs chief US political economist Alec Phillips wrote to clients on Sunday.In any case the progress on trade should allow investors to refocus on the fundamentals. But economic growth is expected to slow in 2019 because of the fading impact of the tax cuts the impact of existing tariffs and higher borrowing costs. Analysts are calling for S&P 500 earnings growth to decelerate from about a blockbuster pace of 21% this year to 9% next year according to FactSet.,Business
New York (CNN Business)Ikea is ditching its famous Swedish meatballs and cavernous blue-and-yellow stores to crack big cities. The company announced on Monday that it will open up a 17530 square-foot showroom on Manhattan's Upper East Side next spring.  The store highlights a different approach for Ikea which has relied mostly on sprawling 300000 square-foot stores where customers traverse a labyrinth of aisles full of sofas cabinetry appliances an knick-knacks and can stop to refuel in the food court. Ikea is overhauling its strategy in order to adapt to the growth of online shopping for affordable housewares and furniture. Competition from players Amazon (AMZN) Wayfair (W) Overstock.com (OSTK) has stiffened while places like the Container Store (TCS) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM) have squeezed Ikea on smaller home decorations. Target (TGT) has also made a play for kitchen and bathroom purchases online. Ingka Group the Swedish holding company that owns and operates most of Ikea's stores said last month that it would lay off about 7500 employees -- 5% of its global workforce -- and build 30 smaller stores in major cities around the world in the next few years."Retail is changing as we speak" Ikea's US chief Lars Petersson told CNN Business. "Urbanization is going on very fast." In response Ikea has been investing in online pickup services digital fulfillment centers and last year it bought TaskRabbit the online marketplace for finding gig workers. It has been adding mini stores for years too.The Manhattan  store will be targeted to New Yorkers looking for ways to maximize room in their apartments and allow them to consult with staff about designs and storage options. "Many people want to see ideas -- to touch and feel" Petersson said.Ikea knows it needs to develop a fresh strategy to attract younger urban shoppers who may want to visit a store but don't own a car or want schlep out to the outskirts of cities.In New York for example Ikea already has a store in Brooklyn and three around the tri-state area. This will be Ikea's first entry into Manhattan."IKEA is very conscious that they have to make more effort to be where people want them to be" said Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData Retail. "The old big store model was very 'build it and they will come.' But that no longer applies."Ikea is still working on designing the new "planning studio" in Manhattan and didn't share many specifics. Analysts say the concept emphasizes convenience and customer service.The store will carry a limited assortment and won't feature restaurants. Most of the items will only be available for delivery. Ikea is following a similar playbook to retailers such as Target Nordstrom (JWN) Dollar General (DG) Home Depot (HD) and even Goodyear Tire (GT). These chains have slimmed down in recent years to enter population-dense areas and gain traction with new customers.Dollar General has opened DGX about half the size of a regular store in Raleigh Nashville and Philadelphia. Goodyear opened Roll showrooms in October next to shopping centers in Washington D.C.Target has found success with its small-format stores near college campuses and on city street corners. It opened 30 in 2017 and plans to open about 30 more a year over the next few years."They really punch above their weight because of their high sales productivity" CEO Brian Cornell told analysts last month about Target's small stores. "This is allowing us to reach a guest that in the past we hadn't been able to serve."However Ikea's concept store carries challenges according to Steve Dennis a former executive at Sears and Neiman Marcus. When retailers cut out too much of their selection they can compromise their brand identity he said. "It's a disappointment to the customers who have come to have certain expectations of what the brand stands for" he said. "The more the concept feels like a watered-down version of the real thing the more risky this is."

New Delhi  (CNN Business)Unilever is boosting its presence in India by buying some of the country's top nutritional drinks. The global consumer goods group is spending £3.1 billion ($3.9 billion) to buy most of the India consumer healthcare business owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) including hugely popular beverage brands such as Horlicks and Boost. The deal announced on Monday will see Unilever (UL) and GSK merge their India businesses Hindustan Unilever and GSK India. GSK will hold a 5.7% stake in Hindustan Unilever after the deal closes. Malted milk drink Horlicks has been positioned as a nutritional product for children in India where it has dominated the market for years. The brand accounted for 45% of India's health drink market in 2017 according to consulting firm RedSeer. That's three times the share of its closest competitor Bournvita owned by Oreo-maker Mondelez International (MDLZ). Unilever will also be getting its hands on Boost another of India's most popular malted drinks. It has endorsement deals with some of India's biggest sports celebrities including cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar and the country's current cricket captain Virat Kohli. With the two brands GSK accounts for more than 60% of India's health drinks market according to RedSeer. Unilever will also buy GSK's business in India's neighboring country Bangladesh as well as nutrition brand rights for "certain other territories" at a price tag of £566 million ($723 million). The deal reflects a push by global companies to cash in on India's fast growing economy including sectors such as   retail consumer goods and technology. Big names including Ikea Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) have poured billions into the country in recent years. GSK said it will use the proceeds from the Unilever sale to shore up its other healthcare products in India including over-the-counter medicines. The deal still needs to be approved by the shareholders of Hindustan Unilever and GSK India as well as by Indian regulators. It is expected to close by the end of 2019. ,Business
New York (CNN Business)TheBlaze and CRTV two of the largest online conservative media organizations announced on Monday that they had merged to form a new company called Blaze Media representing one of the most sizable consolidations to ever take place in right-wing media."We are so grateful and so blessed to finally come together" Glenn Beck the founder of TheBlaze said on his radio program Monday. For years TheBlaze and CRTV have competed against each other offering readers and viewers a similar product as they vied for the same target demographic. Each company featured an on-demand video library of daily programs from an array of conservative commentators. Both companies also operated websites where writers posted conservative commentary and news. Now that the two organizations have joined forces Blaze Media will be one of the largest carrier of on-demand conservative media content on the Internet.Blaze Media said it will also be carried by some television providers including DISH and Verizon. The company however declined to reveal how many subscribers it has.Mark Levin a conservative radio personality and Fox News weekend host who founded LevinTV which grew into CRTV said in a press release that he was "very excited about the merger." He added that the "timing is perfect."The move came just one week after Fox News launched its online-streaming platform Fox Nation which the newly formed Blaze Media will compete directly against.Asked about Fox Nation Gaston Mooney a former CRTV executive who will serve as Blaze Media's co-president told CNN "CRTV and TheBlaze were the two leaders in the SVOD space and it's flattering that more traditional established networks are moving that direction as well. More content choices and voices for Americans is always a good thing." Blaze Media will include traditional conservative voices but will mostly consist of right-wing pro-Trump luminaries. Hosts will include former Fox News host Eric Bolling author Michelle Malkin "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson and others."The real diversity on the right is on display here" Stu Burguiere co-host of "The Glenn Beck Program" said on Monday's radio show.The Blaze Media lineup will also include more radical elements of right-wing media like Gavin McInnes the Vice co-founder who started the fringe "Proud Boys" group whose members have been involved in violent brawls with leftist protesters. McInnes who also has a history of promoting various conspiracy theories disassociated from the organization late last month. "I do this reluctantly because I see it as a the greatest fraternal organization in the world but rumors and lies and bad journalism has made it's way to the court system and the NYC9 (the Proud Boys arrested after I did a talk here in NY) are facing serious charges" McInnes wrote on his YouTube page explaining his decision to disassociate. "I'm told by my legal team and law enforcement that this gesture could help alleviate their sentencing."Asked about McInnes Mooney told CNN "Gavin McInnes is a comedian and provocateur and one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms."Over the past several months there have been signs that TheBlaze and CRTV were moving to consolidate. TheBlaze and CRTV partnered on some projects and the two organizations started corresponding with each other on social media.TheBlaze had struggled for the last few years burning through company executives and laying off dozens of staffers. In June when CNN "Reliable Sources" anchor Brian Stelter questioned Beck about reported troubles at TheBlaze Beck grew upset and walked off set."I think that's the most ridiculous question I have ever heard" Beck said at the time. "I'm sitting here ready to talk to you about the detaining of children and parents and trying to break families apart ... and you want to play those games? Have a nice day.",Business
New York (CNN Business)Tribune Media found another buyer after its last merger was scuttled.Nexstar Media Group announced Monday it will buy Tribune's 42 television stations and cable network in an all-cash $4.1 billion deal. The merger will form the nation's largest TV station company. Tribune's stock (TRCO) is surging 10% in premarket trading.The acquisition comes four months after Sinclair Broadcast Group's attempted purchase of Tribune was terminated. The two companies are still embroiled in lawsuits over the failed merger which came under intense scrutiny from government regulators and criticism from public watchdogs. The sheer size of Nexstar will massively enlarge the Texas-based media company. If approved the combined company will own more than 200 TV stations and cover 39% of US households.  Nexstar will now gain a foothold in major markets including New York Los Angeles and Chicago for the first time plus a cable channel (WGN America) and a 31% stake in the Food Network. Nexstar CEO Perry Sook said in a release that the two companies has a "clear path to closing." "Nexstar has long viewed the acquisition of Tribune Media as a strategically financially and operationally compelling opportunity that brings immediate value to shareholders of both companies" Sook said.The company acknowledged it will have to sell some local TV stations to get approved.The long wait for a buyer is good news for Tribune shareholders: The new deal is a 45% spike in value of its stock compared to its July 16 2018 closing price when Federal Communications Commission Chair Ajit Pai called for a hearing over the Sinclair-Tribune deal. ,Business
New York (CNN Business)1. Crude reality: Cheap oil used to be a slam-dunk positive for the American economy.Abrupt declines in oil prices would create huge savings for consumers and businesses alike. It was like a massive tax cut -- and one that didn't blow up the federal deficit.But the shale oil boom has since changed that equation. The United States today is not only the largest guzzler of oil it's vaulted to the top of the production leaderboard as well. US output recently surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia for the first time since 1973. That means even though President Donald Trump is calling for oil prices to go lower there are significant negative consequences of the deepening bear market in oil.  Lower oil prices threaten to wipe out jobs set off cash crunches at overleveraged frackers and depress business spending. The 2014-2016 oil crash caused hundreds of thousands of job cuts and dozens of bankruptcies. "The US now responds to lower oil prices like an OPEC member" Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson wrote to clients last week. "When the president calls for lower oil prices he's ignoring the new reality."Crude plummeted 22% in November marking the worst month since October 2008. Despite that meltdown Trump has repeatedly pressured OPEC and Saudi Arabia not to dial back production to balance the market. OPEC and Russia are nonetheless expected to seriously consider slashing output at Thursday's highly-anticipated meeting in Vienna Austria. Of course the recent plunge in oil prices is not nearly on the same level of the last downturn. And millions of Americans are enjoying a windfall caused by the slump. And that's a huge plus because the United States is still a consumer-led economy. A gallon of gasoline fetched $2.49 on Friday down from $2.80 a month ago according to AAA. Consumers could use that extra cash to splurge on Amazon (AMZN) this holiday season. But many residents of Texas North Dakota Alaska and other oil-producing states are not celebrating. Crashing oil prices can threaten their livelihoods. "The decline in oil prices is not an unalloyed good" said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher. "The benefits are dispersed but the hits are geographically concentrated."Faucher said that he believes the impact of cheap oil is now neutral on the overall US economy.Shale is a gamechanger Consider what happened during the 2014-2016 oil crash. Gasoline prices plummeted from $3.70 a gallon to just $1.72 according to federal government stats. That helped boost consumer spending.And yet US GDP growth decelerated sharply from above 3% in early 2015 to sub 2% the next year. Capital spending in the mining sector which is mostly oil plunged by $149 billion or 61% from peak to trough according to Shepherdson. He found that matched the pick-up in consumer spending over that span. One big shift is that shale oil now makes up at least half of America's oil output. And shale oil companies unlike their larger rivals quickly ramp up and down their activity based on price swings. And when that happens other parts of the economy feel the impact. The pain from cheap oil can spill over into steel manufacturing real estate transportation logistics and banking. All told Shepherdson estimates that the oil crash wiped 0.3 percentage points off US GDP growth in 2014 and another 0.2 percentage points in 2015. "In the shale new world lower oil prices mean slower US growth" Shepherdson wrote. 2. Trade truce: Presisdent Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping the leaders of the world's two largest economies agreed to a temporary ceasefire in the trade war between the United States and China.After the two-and-a-half hour discussion at the G20 summit in Argentina Trump agreed to maintain the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and not raise them to 25% "at this time" ahead of a January 1 deadline according to a White House statement from press secretary Sarah Sanders.In exchange China agreed it was willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance.Calling the extended meeting "friendly and candid" Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two leaders had agreed to open their markets to each other and to step up negotiations toward elimination of all additional tariffs.Some analysts warn that the truce could be short-lived. "In short this was not a breakthrough on substance but a framework to continue talks. We have long warned of the risk that such a general agreement could break down" Eurasia Group said.3. Jobs numbers: Will November be another strong month for adding jobs? We'll find out on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases new numbers for last month.In October the US economy added 250000 jobs in October which significantly exceeded expectations. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7% a 49-year low. Hispanic unemployment reached its lowest rate ever at 4.4%. 5. Retail earnings: Some stores are reporting earnings this week including Dollar General (DG) Restoration Hardware (RH) and Ulta (ULTA). It's been a strong year for Dollar General: the stock is up nearly 19% for the year. CEO Todd Vasos said on its last earnings call that despite the strong economy weak wage growth has attracted more shoppers that live paycheck-to-paycheck. 6. Coming this week:Tuesday — Bank of Montreal (BMO) Dollar General (DG) and Restoration Hardware (RH) earningsWednesday — US financial markets closed for national day of mourning in honor of former President George H.W.

New York (CNN Business)President Donald Trump says China is willing to approve a major merger between American chip maker Qualcomm and rival NXP. One problem: It's too late.Qualcomm said Monday the clock ran out on the merger and it is ready to move on."While we were grateful to learn of President Trump and President Xi's comments about Qualcomm's previously proposed acquisition of NXP the deadline for that transaction has expired which terminated the contemplated deal" a Qualcomm spokesperson said in a statement. "Qualcomm considers the matter closed and is fully focused on continuing to execute on its 5G roadmap."California-based Qualcomm (QCOM) confirmed in July it was terminating its proposed takeover of Dutch counterpart NXP (NXPI) after China failed to grant it regulatory approval. Qualcomm even paid a $2 billion penalty in July for breaking off the merger.A victim of tension between the United States and China Qualcomm and NXP had waited for regulatory approvals for nearly two years before Xi's administration let the clock run out. The takeover had been approved in eight other jurisdictions including the European Union and South Korea since it was announced in October 2016. Qualcomm moved ahead with a stock buyback of about $30 billion that it had promised shareholders should the NXP deal fall apart. NXP declined to comment.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Buenos Aires Saturday and Trump told reporters that Xi said he would reconsider China's prior decision to withhold approval of the planned $44 billion merger between  Qualcomm and NXP. "If that deal came back to him he would most likely approve it quickly" Trump said. "Which is a big thing."China's official statement after the meeting between Xi and Trump did not mention Xi's willingness to consider approving a $44 billion deal for Qualcomm to purchase NXP if the deal was put before him again.The dissolved deal was one of the most visible repercussions of the escalating trade war between the United States and China the world's two largest economies.The trade dispute was instigated by Trump who is displeased with the United States' trade deficit with China. The dispute escalated with both countries slapping hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs on each other's goods. Trump and Xi met for two hours over dinner during the G20 summit in Argentina. The meeting came days after Trump pledged to hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods even as he expressed optimism about a forthcoming deal with Xi.After the meeting Trump said they had reached an "incredible deal."Trump said the United States would be "holding back on tariffs and "China will be getting rid of tariffs.",Business
New York (CNN Business)US financial markets will be closed on Wednesday to honor the memory of former President George H.W.

New York (CNN Busienss)Sears' make-or-break holiday shopping season didn't get off to a very good start.Foot traffic was down at Sears and Kmart stores last weekend according to research from inMarket a location-based research firm that tracks customer traffic at brick-and-mortar stores using anonymous GPS data from the smart phones of 50 million shoppers. Sears and Kmart make up Sears Holding which filed for bankruptcy on October 15.The data shows foot traffic at Sears and Kmart was down 14% over the three days that followed Thanksgiving compared to the same holiday weekend a year ago. Traffic was down 17% on Black Friday 7% on Saturday and 16% on Sunday according to the research.The research factors in the hundreds of stores that Sears has closed since the end of 2017 and only looks at foot traffic at stores open during both shopping periods.Sears has yet to disclose any sales or traffic data for the start of the season. A spokesperson for Sears Holdings declined to comment. The company is hoping to use the bankruptcy process to shed costs and close additional stores and emerge as a profitable and competitive retailer. But its own bankruptcy court attorneys have said that a strong holiday shopping season is crucial for its ability to stay in business."The weeks that are coming up are really critical for the company's ability to reorganize" said Ray Schrock its attorney at a bankruptcy court hearing a week before Thanksgiving.Schrock predicted the company would be able to post an increase in sales compared to sales at the same stores a year earlier. But Searos has a string of sales declines dating back to 2010. Last year as rival department store chains like Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) and even troubled JCPenney (JCP) all reported improved holiday season sales Sears and Kmart sales fell 16% on average.Sears' sales figures could take an even bigger hit this year as nearly 200 of the 700 stores it still had at the start of the holiday season are in the process of holding closing sales. Those sales include deep discounts on the price of its remaining inventory and no restocking of items once they sell out.,Business
Hong Kong (CNN Business)Turns out China isn't so crazy about "Crazy Rich Asians." The romantic comedy was a breakout success in the United States for Warner Bros. but it flopped at the Chinese box office taking in less than $1.2 million in its opening weekend according to industry tracker Ent Group. To put that in perspective Sony's (SNE) superhero blockbuster "Venom" pulled in $111 million in its opening weekend in China early last month.The dismal Chinese debut for "Crazy Rich Asians" is a disappointment for the makers of the film who had been hoping the romantic comedy would be a hit in the world's second largest movie market. But analysts were doubtful that the film's depiction of high-rolling members of the Chinese diaspora in Singapore would resonate with audiences in mainland China. "Comedies are tricky films to handle in foreign markets including China because their appeal can be nuanced" said Rance Pow CEO of Shanghai-based cinema consulting firm Artisan Gateway. In the United States the movie was lauded for featuring an all-Asian cast at a time when Hollywood has come under fire for its lack of diversity. But "a romantic comedy with an all-Asian cast is not a unique selling point in China" Pow said.The last rom-com smash in China was "Ex-File 3: The Return of the Exes" a domestic franchise starring well known Chinese actors. It hauled in nearly $45 million in its opening weekend at the end of 2017.Beijing was slow to give "Crazy Rich Asians" the go-ahead. It opened in China more than three months after the United States and Asian markets like Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore. It was so late to mainland China that Warner Bros. had already released it on DVD and streaming platforms in other countries. That meant tech savvy Chinese movie fans could potentially find ways to watch the movie online giving them even less of an incentive to watch it on the big screen. Based on the novel of the same name by Kevin Kwan "Crazy Rich Asians" became a late summer hit in the United States and has since been released in dozens of countries from Australia to Venezuela. It has made $238 million worldwide so far. A sequel is already in the early stages of development at Warner Bros. It will likely be based on the second book in Kwan's trilogy "China Rich Girlfriend" which is largely set in Shanghai.(Warner Bros. like CNN is owned by WarnerMedia.),Business
Dubai (CNN Business)OPEC is losing one of its oldest members.The small gas-rich state of Qatar said Monday that it will leave the oil cartel on January 1 after nearly 60 years. The country's state oil company Qatar Petroleum made the announcement in a series of tweets. "The withdrawal decision reflects Qatar's desire to focus its efforts on plans to develop and increase its natural gas production" Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi the country's newly-appointed minister of state for energy affairs was cited as saying in one of the tweets.Qatar has been under a diplomatic and economic embargo by its Arab neighbors including OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for the past 18 months. In response Qatar has been increasing gas production the mainstay of its economy. OPEC has no role in the global market for natural gas. And Qatar made no reference to the dispute with other Gulf states in its announcement emphasizing plans to cement its position as the world's leading supplier of gas. Its exports currently account for about 30% of global demand. "Achieving our ambitious growth strategy will undoubtedly require focused efforts commitment and dedication to maintain and strengthen Qatar's position as the leading natural gas producer" Al-Kaabi said.Marginal OPEC producerQatar is a marginal player in OPEC when compared to some of the cartel's biggest producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq. It pumps about 600000 barrels of oil a day out of more than 27 million from all OPEC members.But the surprise move comes at a critical time for OPEC. Its members and other major producers are due to meet in Vienna this week to discuss cutting production to boost oil prices. Concerns about oversupply have sent oil prices plunging. US crude futures hit a four-year high above $76 a barrel in early October. They are now trading at around $53 a barrel."The decision by Qatar to withdraw from OPEC does come as a surprise but is unlikely to have a significant impact on the oil market" Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Peter Kierna said.A setback for OPECQatar is the first Middle Eastern country to pull out of OPEC which was founded in 1960. Other countries have come and gone — Indonesia left in 2009 before rejoining for less than a year in 2016. Gabon rejoined in 2016 after an absence of more than 20 years. "It's a disappointment for OPEC because they've been trying to attract members" said Robin Mills CEO of Qamar Energy a consultancy firm based in Dubai. OPEC has recently been expanding in Africa with Congo and Equatorial Guinea signing up. "If you add those up [the production] is equal to Qatar's so it's kind of lost the equivalent [output] of those new members" Mills added.The 15 OPEC members collectively supply about 44% of the world's crude oil. The cartel aims to monitor the market and decide to raise or lower oil production in order to maintain stable prices and supply.Qatar has been a member of OPEC since 1961. It said the organization was aware of its decision to withdraw.,Business
Hong Kong (CNN Business)US President Donald Trump says China has agreed to cut tariffs on cars it imports from the United States.Trump made the announcement in a tweet late Sunday in the United States saying Beijing will "reduce and remove" the tariffs which currently stand at 40%. He didn't specify when the change would happen or what the new tariff level would be. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to comment Monday on Trump's statement referring questions to "the relevant authorities." The Chinese Commerce Ministry which typically makes announcements regarding tariffs didn't respond to a faxed request for comment.Trump's tweet comes after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Saturday to hold off on further tariffs in the trade war between the two countries for the time being. But the Chinese government has made no mention of cutting car tariffs as a result of the meeting between the two leaders in Buenos Aires.Xi announced in a speech in April that China would cut tariffs on imported cars this year. His government followed through on that promise three months later reducing them from 25% to 15%. But just days later it imposed new additional tariffs of 25% on American-made passenger vehicles one of the groups of products it targeted early in the trade war with the United States.The move has hurt the profits of major automakers like BMW (BMWYY) and Daimler (DDAIF) the owner of Mercedes-Benz. The German companies both ship SUVs to China from manufacturing plants in the United States. Shares in BMW jumped more than 6% on Monday morning in Frankfurt following Trump's tweet while Daimler's stock leaped more than 5%.Tu Le the head of research firm Sino Auto Insights highlighted the lack of specifics in Trump's tweet.It's unclear whether the tariffs on US cars will be eliminated entirely or just reduced Le said adding that there's no information on the time frame for the changes or which types of vehicles would be affected. If the tariffs are removed altogether it would be "much more advantageous" for the German carmakers rather than US brands he said.Daniel Shane Nanlin Fang and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.,Business
New York (CNN Business)SpaceX is ready to deploy 64 satellites in one fell swoop — a record-setting mission.Elon Musk's company is scheduled to launch a rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Monday between 1:32 pm and 2 pm ET after a series of delays triggered by bad weather and last-minute inspections for the rocket. It will be one of the largest satellite ride-sharing missions ever launched and the most crowded single mission in US history according to Spaceflight SpaceX's customer for the launch.The mission illustrates the growing demand to launch small satellites modern devices that some companies hope will empower an array of new businesses — from internet service to supply chain monitoring. For SpaceX Monday's mission called SSO-A will mark its 19th launch of 2018 surpassing its previous annual record of 18 launches last year.It will also be the first time Musk's company will attempt to send one of its rocket boosters to space for a third time. SpaceX's goal is to drastically reduce the cost of a launch by reusing the hardware a feat its competitors long thought was impossible or uneconomical.The first-stage booster lined up for the SSO-A mission has flown twice in the past six months — first on May 11 for the Bangabandhu mission and again August 7 for Merah Putih.Satellite ride sharingSpaceX's customer for this mission Spaceflight aims to be a sort of Uber service for space. The company has for years worked as a liaison between small satellite companies and launch providers looking to put small payloads onto rockets with extra room on board.  "We started off just selling the excess capacity on whatever launches were out there" Spaceflight president Curt Blake told CNN Business in a recent interview. "Then we said 'Wow demand is so big we should just buy a whole rocket ourselves.' That's how this mission came to be."SSO-A will be the first time Spaceflight has filled a rocket entirely with its small satellite customers. They come from 34 companies and organizations across 17 countries.They include Australia-based Fleet Space Technologies which aims to connect remote devices to the internet via satellite. Two companies — US-based Capella Space Corporation and Finland's ICEYE — will launch satellites that seek to use advanced radars to track airplanes or ships even in cloudy weather. A group of middle school students from Florida is sending an experimental astrobiology satellite. And an art project funded by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art that pays homage to the first African American astronaut Robert Henry Lawrence Jr. will also take flight.Deploying all 64 satellites safely is tricky business. The devices which span a variety of shapes and sizes will ride to space affixed to sides of a large metal structure called a payload stack that will be shielded by the Falcon 9's nose cone during launch. Once in orbit the nose cone will fall away and the satellites will pop off from the payload stack in a carefully orchestrated sequence.Crowded ridesharing missions like this one have been executed before. India's space agency last year shattered a world record by launching 104 small satellites with a single rocket. Another mission from Russia in 2014 deployed 37 satellites.Smallsats and space debrisThere is a massive backlog of small satellites waiting to get to orbit. And companies including SpaceX and OneWeb are racing to send constellations of thousands of high-speed internet satellites into low-Earth orbit.While hitching a ride with larger payloads is considered the cheapest option for getting to space many nascent rocket companies are promising lightweight rockets that can be mass produced and make cheap frequent trips to orbit.One such company US-based Rocket Lab became the first to reach orbit and has notched two missions so far. Its backlog of customers is so long that CEO Peter Beck told CNN Business the company is "not constrained by customers right now — we're only constrained by how quickly we can build rockets."The massive influx of new satellites into low-Earth orbit poses difficult questions for the space sector particularly when it comes to orbital debris.The issue took center stage last month for the US Federal Communications Commission which authorizes telecom satellites for launch. The agency is considering updating a set of 2004 rules "seeking to keep pace with technological and market changes and to incorporate improvements in debris mitigation practices" the FCC said. ,Business
New York (CNN Business)The holidays are the perfect time for shoppers to hunt for a good deal. It's also a prime opportunity for bad actors to scam consumers.Hundreds of malicious Black Friday apps and websites will be looking to steal personal data and credit card information this year in the United States and United Kingdom according to a new report from cybersecurity company RiskIQ. Cybercriminals create fake mobile apps and landing pages with realistic branding especially around major holidays and events like Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. They want to convince consumers to download bad apps or visit bogus sites and ultimately "phish" for sensitive data. A scam circulating on popular messaging platform WhatsApp ahead of Black Friday promises 99%-off discounts on Amazon.com. On Twitter Amazon's official help account wrote: "Please don't share your order/account/personal details in such websites."Consumers are especially vulnerable when shopping on smartphones. Mobile browsers have a much shorter address field and consumers may not see the full URL on their phone. This makes it harder to spot a scam.According to marketing firm Criteo over 40% of all sales in November and December 2017 were made on mobile phones and the trend is only expected to grow.Steve Ginty senior product manager at RiskIQ says to check that the website has a valid "HTTPS" connection with a lock symbol not "HTTP" which is vulnerable to attacks. Users should also be careful when downloading apps. Bogus holiday deal apps made by scammers can fool users into typing in their credit card information while other apps feature malware that can steal personal data or lock a smartphone until the user pays a ransom fee. According to RiskIQ's recent report 5.5% out of the 4324 Black Friday-related apps on global app stores are deemed malicious and unsafe and 4.6% of Cyber Monday apps are malicious. The firm recommends scrutinizing who developed the app and only downloading apps from official app stores like Apple and Google. Yair Levy a cybersecutity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University says to only shop with retailers you trust. "Don't try to look for offers that are too good to be true. At the end of the day that's what they are" he said. Levy also suggests having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track purchases and identify fraudulent activity. Shoppers should be wary of email deals too. Phishing emails can look similar to those sent by top retailers and consumers should ignore or delete these emails no matter how good a deal seems. Cybersecurity company BullGuard says the aim of these fraudsters is to get consumers to click on a link within the email and enter their personal information. Some experts anticipate more scam activity this holiday season than last year."Every year we see this growing significantly" said Levy. "Why? Because it becomes more successful. Every year more people shop online." ,Business
San Francisco (CNN Business)When Dave Weinstein worked in a government job a few years back he took an extreme measure to keep his data secure from hackers. He and his co-workers physically removed the While that level of security isn't always necessary the possibility of having your credit card stolen or misued suffering from identity theft or getting hacked is on the rise. And people like Weinstein are finding creative ways to protect their passwords and devices. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg famously covers up his laptop's webcam with a sticker a practice that is increasingly common and most people now know not to use the same password for all their accounts. Some security experts are taking personal protection even further. Now the vice president of threat research at Claroty an industrial cybersecurity company Weinstein uses at least two different identity-theft protection subscriptions such as Experian Equifax or Lifelock to ensure that his information isn't being compromised or sold online. These services monitor financial data such as credit card information loan applications and bank accounts to ensure that information isn't being compromised or sold online.Weinstein's security practices are far from rare. Wendy Nather director of advisory chief information security officers at Duo Security has a clever trick to thwart would-be hacks."I use a different credit card to make automated [bill] payments online than I do for purchases on the street" Nather said. Nather keeps things separate so that if her everyday credit card is breached she doesn't have to change the card for each of her automated payments. It also minimizes the potential damage a hacker can do because it's not tied to any important online accounts.Others focus on compartmentalizing areas of their lives such as using different physical computers for work and personal use or create separate digital accounts for working shopping and banking. Nather said she's even known people who will only do certain tasks on paper and keep it locked in a safe. Kevin Kosh a partner at CHEN PR which represents tech companies uses a Google voice number -- not his mobile number -- to receive two-factor authentication texts. Two-factor authentication requires using a one-time code to access accounts in addition to a password. His logic is that if you ever change your SIM card — like when you get a new phone or change carriers — there's no connection to your sensitive information.Nather and Weinstein are also big advocates of keeping mobile software up to date for bug fixes and security patches.Weinstein said he's known some people who completely eliminate email due to the high risk of phishing and malware.Although that's not a reasonable fix for most people he noted one area in which people could adopt a more cautious approach is with home routers. "Most people get them through their internet service provider and they don't necessarily prioritize security" Weinstein said. "Consider purchasing a home router as you would any other technology that you care about. It's more than just giving you wireless access. Security needs to be part of the equation." These routers are easily hacked and can provide access to sensitive information because most people feel safe using computers on a protected network. But Weinstein cautioned against taking every extreme security precaution such as using personal servers for email."It's the thing people do to be secure and then it ends up backfiring" he said. "Unless you have a state-of-the-art facility and 24/7 operation center backing it you can't compare the level of security to something as commoditized as Gmail."Nather agrees noting "if you're sufficiently paranoid you can never prove to yourself that you're safe."She said there are some things that should be done off the bat such as 2-factor authentication and loading passwords into a password manager. But "unless you know you're at high-risk of being targeted say a government official or high-placed executive you're probably not going to be." ,Business
New York (CNN Business)If you've stayed at a Starwood hotel in recent years there's a good chance you've been impacted by a massive data breach that potentially exposed the personal data of about 500 million guests. Marriott — which owns Starwood hotels such as the St. Regis and the Westin — on Friday disclosed that the Starwood guest reservation system had been hacked in a breach dating back to 2014. For 327 million people Marriott says the exposed information includes names phone numbers email addresses passport numbers and dates of birth. For millions of others credit card numbers and card expiration dates were potentially compromised. This kind of information could be used to steal your identity and open bank accounts credit cards or loans in your name.It's the second biggest corporate data breach in history behind one involving Yahoo which said last year that 3 billion accounts among several of its brands were compromised.Marriott said it will start emailing users who were impacted and it has set up a website with information about the breach. In the meantime here's what you can do to protect yourself:Change your passwordMarriott says guests should change their passwords regularly and pick ones that aren't easily guessed. For example instead of a common phrase choose a combination of four or more unrelated words with numbers characters and a mix of upper and lower-case letters. You should also have different passwords for all the services you use. "Changing your password will just add one more roadblock to a potential hacker getting into your system" said Aaron Brantly a cybersecurity expert at Virginia Tech.Many websites including social media and financial accounts offer two-factor authentication for an added layer of security. Even if someone obtains your password you can't access your accounts without a second piece of information like a code texted to your phone.Monitor your accounts for suspicious activityMarriott recommends customers keep an eye on their Starwood Preferred Guest account for any suspicious activity. Guests should also check their bank retirement and brokerage accounts as well as credit card statements to look for any unauthorized transactions. Some experts recommend signing up for credit monitoring services or identity theft protection. A more extreme step is putting a freeze on your credit which blocks anyone from accessing your credit reports without permission."Unfortunately the reality is [these consumers] have to monitor continuously for generally the rest of their lives" said Brantly. "These types of accounts are sold regularly on the dark web. ... You can usually buy credit card information for a couple dollars per credit card online."Vivek Lakshman VP of innovation at cybersecurity firm ThumbSignIn says consumers can also enroll in services like WebWatcher -- which Marriott is providing for free for a year --  to track their exposure. These sites monitor websites where personal information is shared and alerts consumers if there's evidence of their information exposed online. Open a separate credit card for online transactionsYair Levy a cybersecurity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University recommends having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track transactions and spot fraudulent activity.If that credit card is compromised you also won't have to update automatic payments for things like bills. Limit the information you shareExperts say not to provide information unless it's absolutely required to buy a product or service. "Consumers should limit what they provide companies based on their need to know. Often companies gather data that they may not need but take if volunteered" said Marty Puranik the CEO of Atlantic.Net a cloud computing and hosting services provider.For example a travel company may ask for passport information but it may not be required. If it is you can ask what other forms of identification you can provide instead."If you give lower level information or information that can be changed -- for example a second credit card to verify your identity -- it is easier to change and protect that than a social security number or passport ID" he said. But this isn't always possible. If you are traveling internationally a company like Marriott may require a passport number. Avoid saving credit card information on websitesExperts recommend minimizing the number of places where you store credit card information. However this doesn't mean your data will be safe or protected -- it just helps cut down on the risk.Another option is to use services such as PayPal Google Pay or Apple Pay which let you pay for goods and services without divulging your credit card to the company you're buying from.Be vigilant Consumers should work under the assumption cyber criminals already have access to their information as breaches become increasingly common. "Having a very healthy dose of skepticism moving forward is probably the best way to safeguard yourself in an era where all your information has been divulged unfortunately" said Brantly.Experts caution internet users to be wary of "phishing" attempts by bad actors looking to steal your data including through bogus emails fake links and fraudulent websites. On its informational website about the hack Marriott reminded members the company will not ask you to provide your password by phone or email. "Know you are consistently being exposed [and] consistently under threat -- not necessarily through any fault of your own but accidental disclosures by companies or carelessness by companies. It requires us in the modern era to be vigilant consistently" said Brantly. CNN's Jordan Valinsky contributed reporting,Business
Bruce Schneier is a security technologist and chief technology officer of IBM Resilient. His latest book is "Click Here to Kill Everybody: Security and Survival in a Hyper-connected World." He blogs at schneier.com and tweets @schneierblog. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion pieces on CNN.  (CNN)Due to ever-evolving technological advances manufacturers are connecting consumer goods -- from toys to lightbulbs to major appliances --  to the internet at breakneck speeds. This is the Internet of Things and it's a security nightmare.The Internet of Things fuses products with communications technology to make daily life more effortless. Think Amazon's Alexa which not only answers questions and plays music but allows you to control your home's lights and thermostat. Or the current generation of implanted pacemakers which can both receive commands and send information to doctors over the internet. But like nearly all innovation there are risks involved. And for products borne out of the Internet of Things this means the risk of having personal information stolen or devices being overtaken and controlled remotely. For devices that affect the world in a direct physical manner -- cars pacemakers thermostats -- the risks include loss of life and property.By developing more advanced security features and building them into these products hacks can be avoided. The problem is that there is no monetary incentive for companies to invest in the cybersecurity measures needed to keep their products secure. Consumers will buy products without proper security features unaware that their information is vulnerable.  And current liability laws make it hard to hold companies accountable for shoddy software security.It falls upon lawmakers to create laws that protect consumers. While the US government is largely absent in this area of consumer protection the state of California has recently stepped in and started regulating the Internet of Things or "IoT" devices sold in the state -- and the effects will soon be felt worldwide.California's new SB 327 law which will take effect in January 2020 requires all "connected devices" to have a "reasonable security feature." The good news is that the term "connected devices" is broadly defined to include just about everything connected to the internet. The not-so-good news is that "reasonable security" remains defined such that companies trying to avoid compliance can argue that the law is unenforceable.The legislation requires that security features must be able to protect the device and the information on it from a variety of threats and be appropriate to both the nature of the device and the information it collects. California's attorney general will interpret the law and define the specifics which will surely be the subject of much lobbying by tech companies.There's just one specific in the law that's not subject to the attorney general's interpretation: Default passwords are not allowed.  his is a good thing; they are a terrible security practice. But it's just one of dozens of awful "security" measures commonly found in IoT devices.This law is not a panacea. But we have to start somewhere and it is a start.Though the legislation covers only the state of California its effects will reach much further. All of us -- in the United States or elsewhere -- are likely to benefit because of the way software is written and sold.Automobile manufacturers sell their cars worldwide but they are customized for local markets. The car you buy in the United States is different from the same model sold in Mexico because the local environmental laws are not the same and manufacturers optimize engines based on where the product will be sold. The economics of building and selling automobiles easily allows for this differentiation.But software is different. Once California forces minimum security standards on IoT devices manufacturers will have to rewrite their software to comply. At that point it won't make sense to have two versions: one for California and another for everywhere else. It's much easier to maintain the single more secure version and sell it everywhere.The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which implemented the annoying warnings and agreements that pop up on websites is another example of a law that extends well beyond physical borders. You might have noticed an increase in websites that force you to acknowledge you've read and agreed to the website's privacy policies. This is because it is tricky to differentiate between users who are subject to the protections of the GDPR -- people physically in the European Union and EU citizens wherever they are -- and those who are not. It's easier to extend the protection to everyone. Once this kind of sorting is possible companies will in all likelihood return to their profitable surveillance capitalism practices on those who are still fair game. Surveillance is still the primary business model of the internet and companies want to spy on us and our activities as much as they can so they can sell us more things and monetize what they know about our behavior. Insecurity is profitable only if you can get away with it worldwide. Once you can't you might as well make a virtue out of necessity. So everyone will benefit from the California regulation as they would from similar security regulations enacted in any market around the world large enough to matter just like everyone will benefit from the portion of GDPR compliance that involves data security.Most importantly laws like these spur innovations in cybersecurity. Right now we have a market failure. Because the courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities and because consumers don't have the expertise to differentiate between a secure product and an insecure one manufacturers have prioritized low prices getting devices out on the market quickly and additional features over security.But once a government steps in and imposes more stringent security regulations companies have an incentive to meet those standards as quickly cheaply and effectively as possible. This means more security innovation because now there's a market for new ideas and new products. We've seen this pattern again and again in safety and security engineering and we'll see it with the Internet of Things as well.IoT devices are more dangerous than our traditional computers because they sense the world around us and affect that world in a direct physical manner. Increasing the cybersecurity of these devices is paramount and it's heartening to see both individual states and the European Union step in where the US federal government is abdicating responsibility. But we need more and soon.,Business
Inside Access only on CNN Business goes behind the scenes of the world's most innovative companies. The multimedia series went inside Richard Branson's Virgin empire and premiered live from Mojave California on November 30 2018.Miami (CNN Business)Richard Branson says Virgin Galactic is on the verge of a major achievement: It will send astronauts into space by Christmas.The billionaire entrepreneur told CNN Business' Rachel Crane this week he is "pretty confident" his space tourism venture can achieve its milestone by the end of the year. "We have a brilliant group of astronauts who literally believe 100% in the project and give it their everything" he said. The first few trips to space will be flown by test pilots without anyone else on board. Branson says he will be the first passenger. Eventually paying tourists will also make the trip."I'm not allowed up until the [test pilots] have broken it in a few times first" he said. "I would love to have gone on this very [first] flight but [pilots] are incredibly brave people."SpaceShipTwo Galactic's rocket-powered plane will fly into space after it detaches from beneath the wing of a mothership. It has been thoroughly tested on the ground and at lower altitudes Branson said. But the first few flights to space will be "the dangerous ones."The pilots will fly the space plane at at 2300 miles per hour accelerating to top speed in about eight seconds Branson said.Earlier this year the company resumed powered test flights of the rebuilt SpaceShipTwo named VSS Unity. The latest test in July sent the craft to a peak altitude of 32.3 miles. The goal is to send VSS Unity more than 50 miles above Earth high enough to earn passengers astronaut wings from the US government.If Virgin Galactic reaches space before the year is done it'll put Branson's venture ahead of its direct competitor Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. Founded in 2000 Blue Origin also plans to offer paying customers suborbital flights. Galactic could also beat Elon Musk's SpaceX — which has a booming business making unmanned trips to orbit and is gearing up to fly astronauts to the International Space Station next year."Safety's all that matters if you're putting people into space" he said. "So none of us will race to be the first."But he added "Virgin Galactic will be the first.""Elon's done extraordinary things. We hope to do extraordinary things. Jeff I'm sure will do extraordinary things" Branson said. "The demand for space travel whether it's satellites putting people into space is enormous...So exciting times ahead."The design and flight control systems of SpaceShipTwo were overhauled following a 2014 test flight crash that killed a co-pilot. Branson has said the accident made him question whether to continue pursuing his riskiest business venture. But the company said it received an outpouring of support including from customers who had reserved $200000 to $250000 tickets to one day ride in SpaceShipTwo. Hundreds of people are still lined up for a shot.The flight will offer tourists a few minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth's curved horizon.It's not clear when Virgin Galactic will be fully operational.Branson is known to set deadlines that aren't met. Virgin Galactic has been developing SpaceShipTwo since 2004 and Branson initially said commercial rides would begin in 2007. Eleven years later the firm is still working on getting its 600 customers into space."Space is difficult. Rocket science is rocket science" Branson said. "I obviously would love to prove our critics wrong and I'm reasonably confident that before Christmas we will do so. I think once we're in space we'll obviously need to do a number of other test flights before I go up and then before we start putting the ... astronauts who signed up to go into space with us."Correction: An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated the speed of SpaceShipTwo and the number of customers Virgin has lined up for travel.,Business
Inside Access only on CNN Business goes behind the scenes of the world's most innovative companies. The multimedia series went inside Richard Branson's Virgin empire and premiered live from Mojave California on November 30 2018.Mojave California (CNN Business)Four years ago a co-pilot was killed during a Virgin Galactic test flight. The tragedy left the future in doubt for the space tourism company and derailed its plans to begin commercial flights to the edge of space.Hundreds of people had already reserved tickets that cost between $200000 and $250000. Some people lost their nerve and canceled their reservations.But over the last few years Virgin Galactic has righted itself. It has debuted an upgraded design of its rocket-powered plane SpaceShipTwo the first of which is called VSS Unity. Pilots conducted its first powered test flights earlier this year — the strongest indication yet that the company is nearing commercial operations."I've been so proud of the [Virgin Galactic] team how they've responded to [the tragedy] and really moved forward with a sense of urgency" Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides told CNN Business' Rachel Crane. "We're about to enter into sort of the highest and fastest part of our flight test program" he said. Galactic will conduct test flights that reach its goal altitude more than 50 miles above Earth. "Then we'll be in a position where we could be doing commercial service" Whitesides said.Branson himself plans to be the first passenger to hitch a ride aboard VSS Unity. Exactly when passenger trips will begin is unclear. Branson who has often touted deadlines that aren't met told CNN Business on Wednesday that he is "pretty confident" VSS Unity's first flight to space will be "before Christmas." Orbital flightThe startup also has its eyes on the moon and beyond. Executives says Virgin Galactic wants to eventually compete with the likes of SpaceX on more difficult and dangerous space travel goals."I'm talking about potentially orbital flight or even staying a week on a space station or going around the moon" Whitesides the CEO told CNN Business. "Or going even farther than that."Orbital flights which require faster speeds and specific trajectories are not in Virgin Galactic's near-term future. The company's current spaceship isn't capable of such a trek. But Virgin Galactic executives told CNN Business they one day could work with Virgin Galactic's sister company — Virgin Orbit which is focused on launching small satellites — to develop new human flight capabilities.Virgin Orbit plans to use a lightweight rocket that will launch mid-air from under the wing of a Boeing 747 to send up groups of satellites some small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart told CNN Business recently that he expects Orbit's first mission to be underway by the "early part of next year.""When a Virgin Orbit [rocket] goes into space it'll be traveling at 18 and a half thousand miles an hour around the Earth" Branson said. "Going from there to then putting people into orbit should be ... a relatively sensible next step."Three minutes in zero gravityGalactic's core technology is the brainchild of Burt Rutan an eccentric aerospace engineer who teamed up with Paul Allen the late co-founder of Microsoft to form Scaled Composites. In 2004 their SpaceShipOne won the $10 million Ansari X Prize a cash-prize competition meant to spur innovation by making two crewed trips to space within two weeks.Virgin Galactic has since spearheaded the effort to adapt the technology for commercial flights.This is how it will work: A carrier plane called WhiteKnightTwo — it looks like two jets flying side by side fused together at their wings — takes off from a runway carrying SpaceShipTwo. At about 50000 feet the mothership releases SpaceShipTwo and the rocket-powered plane free falls for a few seconds. Then the pilot fires the engine heaving the craft further into the sky at three times the speed of sound.At its peak altitude more than 50 miles or 264000 feet above Earth passengers will be able to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and take in sweeping views of the planet Galactic says. From takeoff to landing the trips will last about 1.5 hours.Mark "Forger" Stucky who has piloted SpaceShipTwo on more than a dozen test flights said he takes it "very seriously" — "but I don't feel like I'm walking the plank or you know flipping the coin on whether I'm going to live or not" he said. "You just have to do the proper quality assurance in our case training and whatever simulations to show that you're safe enough" he said.Billionaire's space raceBranson founded Galactic in 2004 around the same time Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk two other deep-pocketed entrepreneurs established space companies of their own. More than a decade later the commercial space industry is booming.Musk whose ultimate goal is to establish a human colony on Mars is leading the charge with SpaceX. It has put more than 60 missions into orbit without crews on board. Musk also plans to launch a trip around the moon in SpaceX's first tourism mission as soon as 2023.And both companies want to adapt their spaceflight technology to shuttle people around the Earth. SpaceX said last year that its forthcoming rocket technology could fly passengers from New York to Shanghai in half an hour. Branson has long envisioned using Galactic's technology for faster point-to-point travel on Earth."Obviously SpaceShipTwo is not a platform that will allow us to go from New York to London in 30 minutes" Enrico Palermo president of The Spaceship Company Virgin Galactic's manufacturing partner told CNN Business. "But it's on the stepping stone."In the nearer term Virgin Galactic will go head-to-head with Blue Origin in offering suborbital tourism flights. Bezos' startup is well underway in tests of a capsule and rocket that takes off and lands vertically. The company told CNN Business it has not settled on a ticket price but Reuters reported they will cost about as much as Virgin Galactic's — between $200000 and $300000 each. Blue Origin has not yet set a date for its first commercial flight. Risky businessAerospace companies face daunting risks. The history of human spaceflight is one of triumphs and tragedies. The deadliest were the Space Shuttle disasters of 1986 and 2003 which each claimed lives of all seven astronauts on board."We think a lot about risk in this company and we know that we will not have a business if we do not have a product that we feel confident flying on ourselves" Whitesides said.The chief executive has skin in the game — he's purchased tickets for himself and his wife.But he added "If we don't take any risks we're not going to advance."Whiteside said he hopes space tourism will set off a contagion of the "overview effect" — a phenomenon that astronauts have described as a profound shift in one's worldview after seeing the Earth from afar."You look at climate change or you look at certain peace and security issues these are issues that cannot be handled just by one country or one city" he said. "They're issues that have to be handled at a really a global scale." Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Enrico Palermo. ,Business
Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's private space industry has suffered a setback after a leading startup failed in its first attempt to put a satellite in orbit.LandSpace a three-year-old company based in Beijing said "something abnormal occurred" in the third phase of the launch Saturday that was meant to send a satellite into orbit for CCTV China's state-run television network.The company is one of several Chinese startups that are trying to follow in the footsteps of Elon Musk's SpaceX in making a viable business out of commercial space launches.LandSpace says it's the first private company in China to receive a license from the government to launch rockets carrying satellites as well as the first to build a three-stage launch vehicle for such a mission.The company aims to eventually carry out launches for companies around the world and to play a role in China's broader spaceflight goals according to its website.LandSpace spokesman Guo Xin said the company is investigating what caused the launch of its "Zhuque-1" vehicle to fail. The problem occurred after the rocket took off from a satellite launch center in the northwestern province of Gansu on Saturday afternoon. Another Beijing-based startup OneSpace made headlines in May with the launch of what it called "the first rocket developed and built entirely with homegrown technology." But that rocket is only designed to carry out tests and research during suborbital flights.The private Chinese companies have a long way to go to match the feats of SpaceX which regularly launches big rockets that put satellites in orbit and then return to Earth.Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.,Business
This story was originally published on August 25 2018.Philadelphia (CNN Business)In a nondescript office building in the suburbs of Philadelphia a software company is watching thousands of pieces of junk floating around in space.One mission of Analytical Graphics Inc. or AGI is to ensure that none of that garbage comes close to colliding with the dozens of billion-dollar communications satellites orbiting Earth.Debris in space is a serious issue. Millions of pieces are already whirling around the result of 50 years of space travel and few regulations to keep space clean.The junk includes defunct satellites discarded rocket boosters and tiny pieces of garbage from a prior collision. At orbital speeds something as small as a ping pong ball could blow a hole in a critical satellite.Collisions can set off disastrous chain reactions spawning thousands of new pieces of debris. Too much junk in one orbital field can render it useless. And too much junk around Earth could mean all spaceflight comes to a grinding halt. That could mean an end to scientific exploration GPS service and satellite TV internet and phone service for millions of people.Tracking debrisThe US government and regulators around the world have long worked to track spaceborne objects and mitigate threats. About five years ago AGI launched a program called ComSpOC making it one of a the few private-sector companies in the business of tracking objects in space."We say we don't have competitors" in the private sector CEO Paul Graziani told CNN during a recent tour of the ComSpOC headquarters. "There are some companies ... focused on the sensor side of things. They have a lot of telescopes all over the world. But that data has to be processed. This is really our strong suit. This is what we do that nobody else does."It's new territory for AGI. The 30-year-old software company is known for creating intricate 3-D models and maps. For example the map of Earth you see at Christmas when NORAD "tracks Santa" is created by AGI.ComSpOC's headquarters are in a dimly lit room painted wall-to-wall black where AGI employees stare at giant glowing monitors that constantly update the projected path of various objects. They look eight days into the future scanning for possible collisions.Identifying riskComSpOC is tracking about 2500 objects that are of interest to AGI's current or prospective customers though the software is capable of handling information about hundreds of thousands of objects.AGI has spent tens of millions of dollars buying data from operators of telescopes radio antennae and radars and the company has also purchased its own data collection devices.If a risk is identified — say a dead satellite could drift within 50 kilometers of an active communications satellite that belongs to one of AGI's customers — the company will alert the satellite operator. Then the operator may choose to fire up the satellite's thrusters and maneuver it out of harm's way.Space is huge and despite the number of inanimate objects orbiting Earth the risk of a crash remains low. It's also impossible to track objects in space with absolute precision so there's always some uncertainty.Given the odds satellite operators don't always choose to maneuver their spacecrafts according to Robert Hall the director of ComSpOC at AGI.Private v. governmentAGI wants ComSpOC to be a premium version of a program currently run by the US military. That program called the Joint Space Operations Center or JSpOC also tracks debris and warns satellite operators of potential risks. It does so free of charge.AGI is betting that some satellite operators are willing to pay for more detailed information hands-on service and the use of AGI's intricate visually striking software.They also wanted to prove that AGI could handle JSpOC's duties — and do it at a lower cost than the billion-plus the US government spends.AGI has landed government and national security contracts. The company's private-sector customers primarily operate satellites in geosynchronous orbit which is located roughly 22000 miles from Earth.Communications companies such as US-based ViaSat or British firm Inmarsat spend heavily to design build and launch hefty satellites. So it makes sense those types of companies would be more willing to invest in AGI's ComSpOC services than an Earth-imaging company that put a few small inexpensive satellites into low-Earth orbit Hall said. Though Hall added AGI is always interested in broadening its base of customers.The vast majority of space junk is located in low-Earth orbit or LEO which is less than 2000 km above the ground. LEO is where the International Space Station orbits and companies like OneWeb and SpaceX are planning to launch constellations that will put thousands of new satellites in orbit.Like many others in the space exploration community Paul Welsh AGI's vice president of business development thinks the need for better regulation of spaceflight is pressing. There should be stricter worldwide rules Welsh says aimed at ensuring new satellites won't become space junk in the future.Also like many others Welsh is only cautiously optimistic the world can avoid disaster."I have faith in tech" he said. But the question is: "Is it going to take some catastrophe to be a catalyst for action?",Business
A lot of responsibility falls to workers from minority groups. They're often the ones asked to educate their colleagues on racism sexism ableism and all the other -isms. They're also the ones who are typically tasked with recruiting more diverse candidates. They're usually the ones tapped to speak up in uncomfortable discussions about company culture. In short they're the ones doing the hard work of making a workplace more diverse inclusive and welcoming to everyone. "Especially if you're a woman of color or visibly queer you will be burdened or assigned or expected to take on that diversity work" says Veronica Caridad Cruz Rabelo assistant professor of management at San Francisco State University.This "double shift" is common in many workplaces. White cisgender or straight colleagues may be fearful of accidentally saying the wrong thing. So instead they task employees of different races backgrounds or sexual orientations with the "diversity work" that otherwise wouldn't get done. The emotional tollIn bearing the brunt of this "diversity work" people find they are coping with both the tangible tasks — like recruiting more minority employees to the company or shutting down a colleague's tone-deaf comments — as well as the emotional side effects that come later. "I don't think people realize how much emotional time it takes and how much physical time it takes" says Jennifer Gómez associate professor at Wayne State University. "I believe that oftentimes it's seen as 'It's not my issue. I'm a white person. Racism isn't my issue. It's not about me. It's about those people over there.' and really diversity and equity is everyone's responsibility." Most damning of all Gómez says this work is usually invisible. Meeting with other employees of color for example isn't something that is typically recognized in employee evaluations and speaking up against sexism in a meeting isn't often part of a promotion track. People from the majority group may not even recognize it as "labor" that detracts from time that could be spent on other work responsibilities. "I'm not going to be promoted for doing this emotional labor" Gómez says. "There just isn't enough time in the day or enough time in my brain to do all these things. I get tired." Where it starts — and stopsThose from the majority group may think they're doing the right thing by turning the work over to people of color LGBT employees and other workers who belong to a minority group.They don't want to take up space in the room — but in avoiding the conversation altogether they're also not taking the time to be an ally. '"Well-meaning' whites want to address these issues and i think the one thing where this needs to start is really listening" says Rebecca Erickson sociology professor at the University of Akron. "This requires a safe space." Their intentions may be good but in neglecting to share their responsibility they're only perpetuating the problem. Erickson suggests organizations keep the power differential in mind: an employee may feel uncomfortable explaining to their manager that the responsibility is being shared unfairly. First of all supervisors need to listen and learn without for example relying on people of color to educate them on racism in the workplace. Managers should bring in people from human resources or even outside firms suggests Erickson. This way the manager gets a chance to learn alongside everyone else and the other employes aren't distracted from their work with requests to do the heavy lifting. Rabelo says she likes and values a lot of the work that goes into promoting diversity and inclusion. But finding that balance between her actual responsibilities and these other responsibilities both of which she thinks are important to the health of her organization — it takes work. "It's one of the most motivating aspects of my job" she says. "A lot of the work I'm taking on is things I initiated. But by and large people are forced to be in these positions and don't want to be" she says. Correction: A previous version of this story mistakenly identified Rebecca Erickson as a professor of psychology. She is a professor of sociology.,Business
I've heard a lot about donor advised funds. Are they a good way to structure my charitable giving while getting tax benefits?A donor advised fund is a relatively simple flexible and tax-efficient way to grow your investments and give to charity. Think of it as a dedicated account for your charitable giving. It allows you to contribute cash securities or other assets to the fund and get an immediate tax deduction. You maintain control of your investments which grow tax-free since they are charitable donations and make grants to the IRS-qualified charity you choose.You can open a fund with as little as $5000. All the money you put in goes to charity (once it's in you're not getting it back) but you get an immediate tax break. Deciding how the money gets distributed is up to you: dole out $2000 every year to a bunch of different charities for example make a significant gift of a $1 million ten years from now or create a fund as a legacy for your children to continue to distribute after your death. "Donor advised funds are one of my go-to strategies for reducing taxes for people who are already charitable" says Patrick King a certified financial planner with Transformative Financial. Here's how to figure out if a donor advised fund is the best way to accomplish your giving goals.The benefitsOpening a fund is relatively easy. You can do it through many public charities such as Fidelity Charitable Schwab Charitable the National Philanthrapic Trust or a community foundation. You just need a Social Security number and at least $5000 to invest though some charities may have higher minimums. If you donate cash you're eligible for a tax deduction of up to 60% of your adjusted gross income.But the real appeal of donor advised funds for many investors is that they might accept a wide variety of donations — including publicly traded securities restricted stock mutual fund shares cryptocurrencies private equity and hedge fund interest real estate or privately held C-corp or S-corp shares — that charities often cannot accept."Donor advised funds have gotten to a place where they can take more complex assets" says Tina Davis Milligan managing director of family office services at BMO wealth management. "A lot of clients have large capital gains and they may give more than they planned because it becomes more meaningful." This is where investors can find very favorable double tax benefits. If you give these appreciated assets directly to a donor advised fund you can first avoid paying capital gains tax and second take an additional income tax deduction in the amount of the full fair market value of the asset up to 30% of your adjusted gross income.A donor advised fund could make a great deal of sense right before retirement says Michael Troxell an investment adviser and certified public accountant with Modern Financial Planning. "While a near-retiree is still working and in a high tax bracket they could contribute a large amount of charitable giving (say 10-20 years worth) to a DAF in order to maximize the tax benefit while being able to distribute the funds to charitable organizations over the course of their retirement" says Troxell.A good time to establish or add money to your fund is after a significant swell in assets — maybe a retirement payout an unusually high bonus or the sale of a company. "When a client has a big year a donor advised fund can 'front load' their charitable giving for future years while providing a large charitable deduction in the year they need it most" says King.The pitfallsLike any investment the value of a donor advised fund fluctuates. Don't get in over your head with a fund that includes costly or risky investments says Dan Stous the director of financial planning at Flagstone Financial Management. Another mistake is opening a DAF with a high-cost provider. "There may be some premium services offered by some providers to justify a fee like acting as a consultant to connect the giver with charities in their community or talking through complex gifting situations but givers should know what they're paying and know what they're getting for that fee."But the biggest pitfall with a DAF is to simply view it as an investment or tax-reduction vehicle says Stous. "Ultimately donor advised funds are a way to give to charity" he says. "If your primary reason for putting money in a fund is something other than a generous heart you're setting yourself up for disappointment.",Business
Los Angeles (CNN Business)Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. helped unveil Audi's upcoming all-electric sports car just before the official kickoff of the Los Angeles Auto Show. The Audi E-Tron GT is expected to go on sale in 2020.With 590 horsepower the E-Tron GT will be capable of going from zero to 60 miles an hour in about 3.5 seconds. It's top speed will be about 149 miles an hour.The slope-backed four-door shares much of its engineering with the upcoming Porsche Taycan. Porsche and Audi are both subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG and the two brands collaborated on the cars' fundamental engineering. Like the Audi E-Tron crossover SUV unveiled in San Francisco in September the E-Tron GT doesn't look startlingly different from Audi's current combustion-powered cars. It's a little lower and its sides are more sculpted than the similarly shaped Audi A7. It even has a version of Audi's trademark grill despite the fact that electric vehicles don't need nearly as much cooling air as gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles.The car unveiled in Los Angeles is technically a concept car but Audi executives insisted it is very close to the final production version that will go on sale in a couple of years.Like Tesla's all-wheel-drive cars the E-Tron GT is powered by two separate electric motors one for the front wheels and one for the back. It also has four-wheel steering enabling tighter cornering.The E-Tron concept car has a range of just under 250 miles on a full charge according to a standard European driving test Audi said. With fast charging the battery will be able to charge up to 80% of that range or about 200 miles in 20 minutes. Wireless charging will also be available on the production version Audi said.Volkswagen AG has made major commitments to producing electric vehicles. As part of that Audi has said it will have 12 all-electric cars on the market by 2025. Audi has also said that by that time at least a third of its sales will be of autos that are at least partly powered by electricity.Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the Audi E-Tron GT's rate of acceleration.,Business
Los Angeles (CNN)The Jeep Gladiator rolled onto a stage at the Los Angeles Auto Show Wednesday. Essentially a Wrangler with a pickup truck bed it's a product Jeep fans have long been waiting for.Jeep's last pickup the Comanche went out of production in 1992. Now the Gladiator will face off against a lot of fresh competition in the mid-sized pickup market. Trucks like the Ford Ranger Chevrolet Colorado and long-time market favorite the Toyota Tacoma are designed to appeal to buyers looking for something more fun and efficient than a massive full-size pickup.But the Gladiator will also appeal to those who simply want a Jeep Wrangler with a bed. Executives at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Jeep's parent company say it's one of the questions they are most commonly asked."When are we going to get a Wrangler pickup?" The Wrangler designed for serious off-road driving is already engineered like a truck rather than like a tall car as most SUVs are these days. That made adding a bed to the back a relatively natural idea.The Wrangler is also the only four-door convertible on the market. That means the Gladiator will be a convertible pickup a truly unique selling point. It will be available with a cloth top or removable hard top. The windshield also folds down as it does on the Wrangler for a complete open-air feel.For difficult off-road terrain the Gladiator will have an optional forward-facing camera enabling the driver to see obstructions just ahead on the trail. The truck will also be able to drive through two and a half feet of water.With its four doors and a five-foot bed the Gladiator is 31 inches longer than a four-door Wrangler. It can carry up to 1600 pounds or tow 7650 pounds. Buyers will be able to choose a 3.6-liter gasoline-powered V6 or a 3.0-liter diesel V6 engine.Besides the bed there are some subtle design changes to meet the special demands of a truck. The openings in the famous seven-slot grill are slightly wider allowing more air to reach the engine for improved towing capacity. The top of the grill is also slightly swept back for better aerodynamics. The tailgate is capable of being lowered to three different positions. The bed can be illuminated with light coming from under the side rails. It will also have covered external power outlets. The Gladiator will be built in Toledo Ohio where the Wrangler is made. Production will begin in the first half of 2019. Pricing will be announced closer to that time.,Business
New York (CNN Business)5G is already here but you can't do much to access those super-fast speeds unless you live in a specific place with a particular piece of technology. That's about to change.Samsung and Verizon (VZ) jointly announced Monday the companies would sell a 5G smartphone in the first half of 2019. Although they didn't say which phone would support 5G Samsung usually announces its latest Galaxy S smartphone in the spring. The mystery phone may not be the first 5G smartphone to hit the market. Unsure of other companies' plans Verizon and Samsung hedged by saying it would be "one of the first." But Samsung is by far the largest smartphone maker in the world and its decision to launch a 5G smartphone means the rest of the market won't lag far behind. If smartphone companies want to stay competitive in the coming years 5G will soon be a must-have.That still doesn't solve the problem of network availability. Verizon's 5G network currently exists in only a small handful of cities. AT&T (T) also has 5G networks up and running in just seven cities. Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) lag behind. Verizon and AT&T lack specific rollout plans or time frames but they plan to bring many more cities online in 2019 and 2020. (CNN is owned by AT&T.)Although 5G may not be much of a selling point now it will be once it's pervasive enough. 5G promises much faster speeds than 4G. How much faster is up for debate (Verizon says "many times faster") but lab tests have yielded speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G. When millions of people are on the network though that tends to slow speeds down a bit. Industry estimates put 5G at around 10 times faster than 4G in real-life scenarios.That's where 5G's ultra-low latency technology really comes in handy. Today's networks take a split second to send and receive communications between your smartphone and the network. A split second isn't much but your phone could make dozens of request each time you tap on your screen. 5G gets that network communication time down to virtually zero.5G is exciting technology for smartphone owners but it's potentially much more important for broadband customers and businesses. Verizon already sells 5G home internet service as a replacement for wired internet connections for homes — it even comes with free YouTube TV as a throw-in. 5G potentially allows companies like Verizon and AT&T to become broadband competitors in every city — something they were unable to do with FiOS and U-Verse.5G's low latency can allow self-driving cars to process all the information they need to make life-or-death decisions in the blink of an eye. And the health care industry believes 5G could help power the next generation of telemedicine and robotic surgeries.Before all of that can happen however wireless companies have tens of billions of dollars worth of infrastructure to upgrade.That's a big commitment but they've made good on their promises before.  For example Verizon also offered the world's first 4G smartphone the HTC Thunderbolt which debuted in March 2011. It similarly could only be used in certain areas as Verizon built out its 4G network and the world collectively rolled its eyes. Yet other smartphone manufacturers quickly followed suit and 4G modems became standard equipment on smartphones by the end of 2011.,Business
San Francisco (CNN)In the summer of 2017 hikers found skeletal remains on the side of a highway outside of Baltimore. For months police were unable to identify the body. But then they caught a break with a pioneering technology that requires only a small amount of DNA to create an image of what a person could look like. Using that likeness police were able to make an identification of the female victim and then arrest her killer. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison.But it isn't just being used to identify Jane and John Does. That same technology has helped police create potential likenesses of killers. With a single drop of blood a composite image was made that helped authorities catch another man who had brutally assaulted a 17-year-old girl in New Mexico and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. It also led to the arrest of a man charged with murdering a 25-year-old woman in Texas who was never considered a suspect of the crime. His trial is pending. The technology relies on the fact that DNA has a specific set of instructions for a person's physical characteristics. It only needs a small sample to be able to pull from tens of thousands of genetic options and create an informed prediction of what someone could look like.Parabon NanoLabs one of the companies that offers this technology has been working with law enforcement since 2015. The service which costs about $3000 per composite image has already assisted in over 40 cases."In a lot of the cases we work it turns out that the police had some information that was leading them in a particular direction and our information completely redirects" Dr. Ellen Greytak told CNN Business. "You know you're not looking for a person of that description. You're looking for a person with this very different description. And once they pivot and start going down that road they can find that person."DNA phenotyping is different from traditional DNA profiling which relies on matching the relevant DNA from a crime scene with DNA that has been obtained from potential individuals. With DNA phenotyping a match isn't being made so the relevant DNA is used on its own without having to compare it to DNA that's been collected beforehand and is in the system. "We're essentially bringing in entirely new ways to analyze forensic DNA" Greytak said."The traditional forensic DNA analysis looks just at 'Can this DNA from a crime scene be matched to a suspect we've already identified or to a database?' And it's great for that but if you don't find a match it couldn't tell you anything else. We can generate leads just from the DNA that's at that crime scene."Parabon said the information it predicts is generally observable by the public such as eye and hair color. When it uses genealogy information it relies on public databases such as Ancestry.com.But some experts say accessing DNA and genetic information in this way and the predictive nature of the technology is a cause for concern.Arthur Caplan a professor of bioethics at NYU's Department of Population Health said "the consent isn't as explicit and clear as it needs to be."He said people in public genealogy databases may not realize that it's being used in this way. But he said there are fewer concerns over the use of DNA. "DNA privacy is very flimsy" he said. "You're leaking your DNA everywhere you go. In part it's ethical because DNA is left all over the place. It'd be another thing to come into your house and approach your bed when you're asleep and try to get a swab out of your mouth."He noted gathering DNA from blood found outside of someone's home isn't that different from getting DNA from a discarded cigarette butt or coffee cup.While he said the science isn't yet 100% accurate he noted that it's only going to get better as the science and understanding of genomes improves. "There's all kinds of info lurking in our genes" he said. "Not everything is there but a lot."There are already some clear limitations. The composites can't reveal an individual's age and they can't lead directly to a conviction on their own but similar to a mug shot it may help police narrow their search.Still Greytak hopes the technology will help law enforcement solve active cases faster and cut down on the number of existing cold cases."Cases won't have to go cold" Greytak said.,Business
New York (CNN Business)The Trump administration wants to reform a popular American work visa program.The Department of Homeland Security released a proposal Friday that would increase the number of H-1B visa recipients who have master's degrees or higher level degrees and would move the registration process online.The government has been working to crack down on the H-1B program — a result of President Donald Trump's direction that agencies implement a "Buy American Hire American" strategy.The H-1B visa is a work visa that's valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years. Many companies use H-1B visas to help fill their workforces. But tech is the sector most commonly associated with H-1Bs. Tech firms big and small say they need the H-1B program to hire trained talent that they can't find at home.65000 H-1B visas are granted annually with another 20000 reserved just for people who hold advanced degrees from US higher education institutions. Demand for the visa often exceeds the supply triggering a lottery system. The proposed rule would change the selection process so that all registrations — including those from people who are eligible for the advanced degree exemption —  are applied to the regular cap of 65000 first. After that US Citizenship and Immigration Services would select from the remaining to fill the degree cap. The agency says this new process could increase the number of H-1B holders who have advanced degrees by up to 16% — ensuring that "more of the best and brightest workers from around the world come to America" under the program USCIS spokesman Michael Bars in a statement to CNN Business.The proposal also includes plans to modernize the registration process by moving it online. That would cost the government nearly $280000 to develop in the first year and an estimated $200000 in fees in each subsequent year.USCIS says that part of the rule would decrease costs for applicants by cutting down on paperwork making the process more efficient for the government."The cost signals that the new system will be complex and comprehensive" said immigration attorney Tahmina Watson of Watson Immigration Law. She said she was concerned about whether the government is rushing to put out the new system before it is ready. It's unclear whether the system would be ready in time for the spring which is when H-1B registrations are due.The public can weigh in on the proposed rule December 3 2018 through January 2 2019.,Business
San Francisco (CNN Business)Alexa and Apple are playing nice. Amazon's Echo smart speakers will work with Apple Music starting December 17 Amazon announced Friday. If you have an Apple Music account and have connected it to your smart speaker in the Alexa app the speakers will be able to play music on demand. Just say for instance "Alexa play Baby Shark on Apple Music." Apple's $9.99 a month music subscription service will join Spotify Pandora iHeartRadio Amazon's own music service and other options on Alexa devices. Apple is careful about access to its services outside of its own ecosystem especially when it's on a device that competes with an Apple product — in this case the HomePod. The agreement is the latest sign of good relations between the two companies. It comes two weeks after Amazon announced it was working with Apple to carry the latter's newest products. As part of that deal Amazon agreed to prohibit unauthorized third-parties from selling Apple goods on its site a deal that angered some independent sellers and iPhone repair companies. Apple and Amazon are still competitors however. Amazon will still not sell the HomePod smart speaker sticking to its own Echo offerings instead. And you cannot access Amazon Music through Siri on the HomePod at this time.Spotify will likely be the most impacted by the addition as it offers a similar service for the same price. Unlike most of the other music options including Spotify there is no free tier of Apple Music but you can get a three month free demo period. Gartner analyst Werner Goertz says Apple Music coming to Alexa products is another example of digital services being consumed through a variety of products brands and categories. Since their launch in 2015 smart speakers have added many new features like the ability to order a pizza or play games but the ability to listen to music is still the most popular feature on the devices according to an Adobe Analytics survey. The company tracked 1000 smart speaker users and found that 70% used the devices for music. The second most popular activity was checking the weather.Since it was released in February the $349 HomePod has struggled with middling reviews a high price and limited features. It doesn't support as many third-party services as Amazon's Echo."Although HomePod with its current pricing and feature set is not as prevalent as Amazon Echo devices or Google Home devices I wouldn't consider the fact that Apple Music can be delivered by Alexa as a sign of surrender" said Goertz.,Business
New York (CNN Business)A version of this article first appeared in the "Reliable Sources" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.A presidential funeralThis week for the first time in nearly 12 years America will lay a former president to rest. George H.W. Bush will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda from Monday evening until Wednesday morning.Then there will be a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral. Bush spoke at the most recent presidential memorial there -- a service for Gerald Ford in January 2007.Ford passed away "just after a midterm election in which Democrats won Congress" the NYT's Peter Baker tweeted. "His departure occasioned a moment of bipartisan coming together — but just a moment."More than a decade later in this twittery age state funerals are still television events -- bringing people together and bearing witness to American greatness. The goodbye to Sen. John McCain earlier this year was a "where were you when?" moment. And Bush's farewell will receive even more attention."You know we're not a very historical society" Frank Sesno told me on Sunday's "Reliable Sources." And we live at a time when events fly by in real time "instantaneously and then it's gone." So memorials like this week's tributes to Bush 41 are a rare chance to "reflect on a life and to think what service to country actually looks like" Sesno said. Wednesday in DC Thursday in HoustonAfter the DC service on Wednesday the former president will be flown back to Texas. There will a memorial service in Houston. Then per CNN's story here he will be laid to rest at his presidential library in College Station Texas "where his wife Barbara Bush and daughter Robin who died of leukemia as a child are buried." Monday's morning showsCNN's "New Day" anchors John Berman and Alisyn Camerota will be live from DC on Monday. So will "CBS This Morning" co-anchors John Dickerson and Norah O'Donnell. CBS co-anchor Bianna Golodryga will be in Houston. (Gayle King is on some pre-planned time off.)On NBC Savannah Guthrie will co-anchor from DC starting Monday through Wednesday. Later in the day ABC's "World News Tonight" anchor David Muir will be live from DC... with Amy Robach in Houston... Interviews with past presidentsGeorge W. Bush Bill Clinton and Barack Obama taped interviews withNorah O'Donnell in the past 18 months knowing the Q&A's would only air after Bush 41's passing. Those interviews formed the basis of this double-length segment on Sunday's "60 Minutes." Obama has granted very few interviews since leaving office last year so it's notable that he participated in this.When a member of "The Presidents Club" dies you naturally want to hear from the other members. CNN's Jamie Gangel sat down with both Clinton and Bush 43 for her Saturday night special report... When the news broke on Friday...As the NYT's Peter Baker reported here "Bush had been fading in the last few days." 41's last words were to Bush 43 via speaker phone.On Friday night a small number of reporters were in position in Houston on standby for the announcement. Many others were caught by surprise when Jim McGrath Bush 41's longtime spokesman announced the former president's passing at 11:48 p.m. ET. It was too late for some major papers to rip up the front page. But all three cable news channels were still live. Don Lemon Steve Kornacki and Shannon Bream reported the news on CNN MSNBC and Fox respectively. Lemon went live to CNN's Jamie Gangel and then to Dana Bash who was standing by in Houston. He stayed live until 3 a.m. ET when CNN showed the HBO documentary "41."On Fox Bret Baier and others joined Bream's special coverage. Meantime Kornacki anchored a lengthy special report for NBC stations across the country featuring an obit by Lester Holt. The special reports at midnight on ABC and CBS were much shorter. ABC's cut-in was led by correspondent Lynda Lopez who sometimes appears on ABC's overnight newscast. Byron Pitts anchored a special edition of "Nightline" at 12:30. On CBS one of the network's L.A. station anchors Sharon Tay led a short special report about Bush's passing. In these moments you see how prepared the networks are... or are not... for big breaking news stories. TVNewser has details here... Reflections from veteran reporters Bush was "available and accessible" to the press corps former White House correspondent Charles Bierbauer said on "Reliable.""He also understood our job" Sam Donaldson added. "Presidents don't like everything they read or see but he understood what we were about."Read Jackie Wattles' story about the segment here... A very different media environmentBush 41 was the last president to serve in a pre-WWW pre-Drudge pre-Fox News world. "This was before the age of the Internet and before cable exploded into what it is now" Sesno said on "Reliable." He described genial relationships between the W.H. press secretary and the press corps that are hard to picture today... >> One more point from Sesno: H.W. Bush "actually believed in government..." >> But was it really a "kinder gentler time" as some have said? Donaldson and I discussed how Bush's 1988 campaign trafficked in fear-mongering via the infamous Willie Horton ad. We talked about Lee Atwater and Roger Ailes' roles... Video here... 41 versus 45So many of the conversations about Bush's life and legacy are a contrast to President Trump. There's just no way to pretend otherwise.WaPo's Greg Jaffe captured it this way: "In death Bush becomes a yardstick for President Trump."This came up all weekend long. Witness Maureen Dowd: "Covering H.W.'s White House was wildly different than covering Donald Trump's" she wrote. "A Trump day bursts with a fusillade of huge news stories often starting at dawn with a crazy tweet and usually involving the amorality criminality and vulgarity of the president and his circle.

New York (CNN Business)This story Ellen Gabler says is a "good reminder to keep being persistent." To keep calling texting and e-mailing.The New York Times has published a blockbuster story about the end of the Les Moonves era. It detailed Moonves' attempts to find a job at CBS for an alleged victim so that she would stay silent.The woman's name is Bobbie Phillips. Her former talent manager Marv Dauer talked with Moonves about lining up possible jobs for her. The Times has the text messages to prove it."If Bobbie talks I'm done" Moonves told Dauer according to Dauer's sworn statement.Eventually she did talk to The Times. All of this is explained in the roughly 5000-word story.The story about the story is pretty remarkable too. The three reporters who were involved — Ellen Gabler Rachel Abrams and James B. Stewart — sat down for an in-depth interview on the "Reliable Sources" podcast.  The fall of Moonves is a tale "about how people use every lever at their disposal to protect themselves" Abrams said.Listen to the full podcast here:The Times' story appeared on the cover of the Sunday Business section on December 2 almost three months after Moonves was forced out of his CEO chair.His departure came after The New Yorker published two stories by Ronan Farrow — one in late July and the other in early September.Each story described allegations of sexual misconduct by six women for a total of a dozen. In September Farrow said some of the women spoke out because they felt CBS was failing to take appropriate action against Moonves.When Farrow's second story came out Moonves said the "appalling accusations in this article are untrue." He said he never abused his power as a Hollywood executive and said he could only surmise that the allegations "are surfacing now for the first time decades later as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name my reputation and my career."The CEO was out within eight hours of the publication of Farrow's second story.But in the immediate aftermath Stewart's sources told him there was something else going on."They were telling me look it really wasn't about The New Yorker story. I know it looks like it was but it wasn't" Stewart said.What really turned the CBS board of directors against Moonves according to Stewart and The Times' reporting was that Moonves tried to get Phillips a job and didn't disclose all of this to the lawyers who were hired to investigate the allegations."Upon learning that Mr. Moonves had tried to find a job for an accuser the CBS board held an emergency meeting with their lawyers" The Times reported in its new story.But the newspaper's reporting started one year ago in November 2017 in the immediate aftermath of stories about Harvey Weinstein Charlie Rose and other powerful men accused of misconduct.On the "Reliable" podcast Gabler said that she and at least one other Times reporter made calls about Moonves that month. Like Farrow they knew about the rumors of Moonves and sexual misconduct. "Our job as reporters of course is to get beyond the gossip and get people to talk to us and tell us what really happened" she said.But sources like Dauer the talent manager who ultimately became a key player dodged her calls. It was a "red flag" she said. "You think 'Hmmm maybe they actually really know something.'"At the time Dauer was a dead end. Gabler had heard Phillips' name — she said "we knew something had happened to Bobbie" — but "we didn't know exactly what had happened."Months later after Farrow's first story about Moonves Stewart reported on the CBS board machinations. After Farrow's second story and after Moonves was forced out Stewart learned that Moonves and Dauer's dealings were at the heart of the CBS decision to oust him. But the board members didn't know the details. It was all still a mystery.That's when an editor connected Stewart with Gabler. Up until then the two reporters had never met. (The Times has a big newsroom after all.) So they started working together. Knowing that calls from The Times switchboard sometimes scare off sources Stewart secured a local 310 area code number. He called Dauer and many of Dauer's friends building on Gabler's many previous calls. "How did you get their phone numbers?" Dauer asked him. Before long Stewart had a dialogue going with Dauer. One thing led to another. And at the same time a third Times reporter was working on a story about the law firms CBS had hired to investigate misconduct. This is where Abrams comes in. One day Abrams walked by Stewart's desk and shared what she was working on. It was an ah-ha moment. Stewart revealed what he was working on with Gabler. "So that's what led me to try to help" Abrams said. Her sources provided some key pieces of information. The trio discovered that the lawyers involved in the CBS investigation "were on a very similar track to us" Abrams said.The Times ultimately reported that it was the attempted cover-up not necessarily the allegations that accelerated Moonves' exit from CBS. When Phillips read The New Yorker story she realized she was not "the only victim" Stewart said and she was "enraged."According to The Times her allegation dates to an encounter in Moonves' office in 1995. She told the newspaper that Moonves committed sexual assault.She was "completely credible" Stewart said noting that even her manager did not know what happened in the office.Moonves responded in a statement to The Times: "I strongly believe that the sexual encounter with Ms. Phillips more than 20 years ago was consensual.""I won't say in this case the cover-up was worse than the crime because the incident is so bad" Stewart said. "But the cover-up is very bad and it really I think will be the cover-up that — if he ends up losing $120 million — that's what it will be about."That's how much money Moonves may be owed according to the terms of his contract. But if the board determines that he can be fired for cause then the $120 million would return to the CBS coffers.The two law firms hired by CBS to investigate the issues are still at work and no decision has been made about the $120 million.Stewart said the trio's investigative journalism revealed something that's bigger than CBS. It's about how money and power are used to smother sexual misconduct."We would be naive to think that there have not been other instances where in fact a scheme like this worked" he said. "Where powerful people have traded either money or favors or influence or something in order to silence their accusers.",Business
New York (CNN)Former ABC correspondent and host Sam Donaldson who covered the White House going back to the 1960s remembered George H.W. Bush as a president who was "accessible" and "understood" the role of a free press.Donaldson told Brian Stelter on CNN's "Reliable Sources" Sunday that Bush who died Friday at his home in Houston at the age of 94 sometimes challenged reporters but he was always respectful."I never heard of him calling a reporter to chew him out never being angry at a reporter" he said. "He understood what we were about."Charles Bierbauer who served as CNN's senior Washington correspondent during the Bush years told Stelter Sunday that Bush always came across as "informed.""And gosh that's what journalists like" Bierbauer said.Donaldson expressed admiration for Marlin Fitzwater who served as press secretary under Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan.Fitzwater would "slide around" questions "but he didn't try to insult reporters" Donaldson said. Former CNN Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno told Stelter that Fitzwater was upfront with reporters when Bush misspoke and would actively work to set the record straight. Fitzwater would "walk around and say what the president meant to say was this or that" Sesno said. "There was no attack there was no suggestion it was fake news.""It really I think was a mark of that sense of respect as I say that was very very noticeable then and is all -- well is virtually absent now" Sesno said. "Of course this was a different environment. ...This was before the age of the Internet and before cable exploded into what it is now."Bush did however have his reservations about the press just as other presidents did Sesno said.He remembered sitting down with Bush in La Crosse Wisconsin shortly before he lost his reelection bid to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992. Senso asked him about his role in the Iran-Contra affair and Bush was "furious.""At one point said 'Are we going to talk about anything else?'" Sesno said.

San Francisco (CNN Business)In the nearly four years since Microsoft introduced its HoloLens augmented-reality headset consumers have largely forgotten about it. But now it's gaining traction among an unlikely audience: car makers.Toyota is one of a growing number of auto makers hoping augmented-reality headsets can improve everything from designing cars to manufacturing and fixing them. These headsets let users merge 3-D images with the real world. For example Ford and heavy-duty truck maker Paccar are among those using the HoloLens to help design cars and Daimler recently said it purchased over 100 HoloLens headsets to train its mechanics with 3-D models of vehicles and parts like brake systems.But the augmented-reality market is still small: Eric Abbruzzese an augmented- and virtual-reality analyst with ABI Research expects more than 2 million headsets and smart glasses will ship this year. Most of that market is made up of businesses still testing the technology. Abbruzzese predicts it will grow to 29 million by 2023.The most recent example of car makers adopting the technology is Toyota. At its headquarters in Japan's Aichi prefecture employees like Koichi Kayano are experimenting with HoloLens for a variety of tasks. Kayano a project manager who finds ways to use 3-D models across the company is using the headset to speed up the process of measuring the thickness of a vehicle's paint and rust-prevention coatings to ensure consistent color and avoid corrosion.Typically this process takes two people an entire day but the HoloLens cuts it down to four hours -- and only requires one person to do it. Workers traditionally carefully place specially-made paper patterns which have about 500 holes cut throughout on the exterior of a car. An employee then scans the visible paint with a measuring instrument. Now Kayano and his team developed an app that lets them skip the paper pattern and use the HoloLens to project a digital array of dots onto a real car revealing which areas need to be tested."It's as quick as wearing a HoloLens and seeing the measurement points virtually on the vehicle" Kayano told CNN Business through an interpreter during a phone interview. "Preparation time is like instant."Toyota is also using the headset to visualize new machines on the factory floor at scale and in 3-D and determine where they will fit. It's also conducting a similar experiment to figure out whether large vehicles can fit inside a building.But HoloLens still faces adoption challenges. To start HoloLens is a pricey investment -- it costs $3000 or $5000 per headset depending on whether you want a developer or enterprise version. The hardware also hasn't been updated since it was released two and a half years ago and at 1.3 pounds it remains heavy especially when worn for hours at a time. Meanwhile the battery only lasts between two and three hours of continuous use.HoloLens is far from the only wearable AR device on the market. It competes with Magic Leap's recently released Magic Leap One headset and AR glasses from companies such as ODG Vuzix and Epson. Still HoloLens has become the "gold standard" of high-end AR products due to features like showing the user 3-D images that can stick to one spot in the real world and letting a remote person see what's in the user's real-world field of view said Abbruzzese.However companies have been somewhat slow to buy and use AR technology due to concerns about cost as well as if it's worth it to provide the resources to train workers. But Abbruzzese said Toyota's use of the HoloLens to measure paint thickness is a clear example of possible savings."Toyota can then make a very informed decision about how well this can scale and [determine] the return on investment" he said.Toyota declined to share how many headsets the company has bought so far. But Microsoft did confirm the car companies are purchasing them -- either from Microsoft itself or from a supplier.Although Toyota's HoloLens project is only a test so far the company said it's also helping with the development of a vehicle coming to the market in the near future. ,Business
 (CNN)From Elsa's magic in Frozen -- and those gigantic ice shards that rise from the stage -- to social media taking on a nearly principle role in Dear Evan Hansen the Great White Way produces some of Broadway's most elaborate and technical stage spectacles two times a day.But behind the stage it's a different scene: Directors and stage managers are still lugging around 10-pound production books filled with paper that's often swapped out for script and choreography changes especially during pre-production and previews. And when understudies and new ensemble members are added hours before the curtain raises -- some of whom have never seen that scene before -- there's a steep learning curve to teach it fast.Now backstage is catching up to the innovation we see in the seats.Several shows including Kinky Boots and Pretty Woman: The Musical are shifting to a paperless system that packs the script lyrics videos and costume and prop notes into one spot for the director crew and cast members.The productions are leaning on an app from startup ProductionPro which is already used at companies such as Walt Disney Studios to help produce film and TV shows. During a recent rehearsal of Pretty Woman: The Musical attended by a handful of reporters production stage manager Thomas Recktenwald ran lines with three cast members subbing in for an evening performance. Swiping through the ProductionPro app on an iPad Pro Recktenwald showed off recent changes made to the script. It had notes scribbled into the margins via an Apple Pencil and he tapped his way through videos that highlight blocking broken down scene by scene.On the choreography side the dance captain might show the newer actors or understudies how a scene may look when a palm tree crosses from side of the stage to another and where they'll need to stand nearby. For last minute changes productions like Pretty Woman are not only saving time but cutting down a significant amount of paper waste. Production associates typically sprint to copy machines to give the cast and crew a look at what's new. (On average the show changed about 30 pages a day during its 12-week pre-production period -- and about 50 people received those copies daily). But Recktenwald or director Jerry Mitchell now pushes the update to anyone who's been given a ProductionPro log-in."We've gone through pages and pages of paper that have been printed distributed multiple times a day and then recycled or discarded in the same day -- and even in the same hour -- to improve the show to what we see on stage today" he said.ProductionPro founder Alex Libby who started as a Broadway stage manager came up with the concept to simplify the process five years ago when he was a producer alongside director Stephen Daldry known for his work on The Crown and Billy Elliot on Broadway."We were working on a brand new show at his kitchen table in the Meatpacking District" Libby told reporters. "There was paper everywhere -- costume designs set designs and script pages constantly changing. He looked up from this mess and was like 'I need a way to see this almost like a musical score; where I can see the entire opus in one place. I need a window into the world that we're creating.'"Libby transitioned from the musical world to launch his own software company which now has 10 employees working out of its Brooklyn New York office. While ProductionPro is focused on rolling out the technology to even more shows on Broadway it's also currently being used by 400 US high schools working on theatrical productions.David McQueen research director at tech advisory firm ABI Research says the move to streamline large-scale productions to tablets makes sense."Tablets are gaining traction in many industries and businesses from education and healthcare to lawyers and restaurants so it is of no surprise that Broadway is also turning to them for ease of access to vast amounts of scripts and videos" he told CNN Business. He emphasized how tablets enable real-time long-distance sharing in a relatively easy-to-use form factor has broad appeal."And of course there are also the immediate benefits of reducing paper waste and literal storage space" he said. "Bye-bye filing cabinets." Or in Broadway's case farewell 10-pound production books.,Business
New York (CNN Business)Those who miss Vine videos may find some solace in TikTok.The Chinese short-form video app has been gaining global momentum. It's been downloaded about 80 million times in the United States and nearly 800 million times worldwide according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower. Those figures exclude Android users in China.Users share short videos of themselves cooking dancing lip-syncing or doing regular tasks like brushing their teeth. The videos which often feature music in the background can be sped up slowed down or edited with a filter. Similarly to Instagram users can follow others and "heart" or comment on videos. TikTok videos are also being reposted to other platforms like Twitter and Instagram. According to Sensor Tower TikTok's revenue has more than tripled in the past year. The app has increased its international marketing efforts canvassing Instagram and Snapchat with TikTok ads. Social media influencers and celebrities are starting to join. YouTube star Jake Paul comedian Jimmy Fallon and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk all have accounts.TikTok -- which launched in 2016 -- was downloaded more than Facebook Snapchat Instagram and YouTube in October according to Apptopia an intelligence firm that tracks mobile apps. It's on track to beat them out in November too. In August ByteDance the Chinese internet company behind the app shut down Musical.ly -- a short-form video app it acquired in November 2017 --  and merged it with TikTok. Since then it's been gaining popularity in the United States. ByteDance calls itself an artificial intelligence company and it's known in China for its popular news app Jinri Toutiao or "Today's Headlines" which launched in 2012.The TikTok app is a way for ByteDance to expand into the US market and target younger users. In general Chinese social media apps have had trouble attracting users from outside their country. "TikTok could be the first long-term successful social app in the United States owned and operated by an Asian company" Apptopia wrote in a recent report. TikTok is attracting attention from brands too. It recently teamed up with fashion brand Guess on a denim campaign to target Millennials and Generation Z on the platform in September. Facebook has taken notice of TikTok's rising popularity and even launched a competitor app called Lasso earlier this month. The app lets users create and share short videos with music and camera effects. Adam Blacker communications lead and VP of mobile research at Apptopia called Lasso "almost identical" to TikTok. "[Lasso] has not been downloaded much at all but the behemoth hasn't put any marketing power behind the launch either" he said. "Facebook likely views the launch as extended beta testing but also wants to understand what juice it has in terms of organic and viral growth."Not all viral apps end up successful and TikTok's fate is still to be determined.In February Vero was briefly the hot social media app of the moment. Pegged as an alternative to Facebook and Instagram it showed users content in the order it was posted and didn't feature ads. Other social apps such as Peach and Ello also went viral before fizzling out.CNN Business' Sherisse Pham contributed to this report. ,Business
Mountain View California (CNN Business)John Krafcik downshifted his white Porsche 911 and whipped it around a curve on a heavily wooded mountain road. The car's 25-year-old engine made its distinctive soft rumble behind us as he accelerated out toward the next turn. For a few moments we stopped talking. I was enjoying the drive but also the pleasant irony of it. That's because Krafcik is the CEO of Waymo the self-driving car division of Google's parent company Alphabet.I first got to know Krafcik years ago when he was the head of Hyundai Motor America. Before that he had worked at Ford. He owns a small collection of cars that includes two Porsches (neither particularly high-end) a souped up Volvo wagon and a little known bare-bones British sports car called a Caterham. These aren't cars for showing off. These are cars for driving. Because John Krafcik loves to drive. He makes no secret about it and he sees no conflict. This is not like the owner of a vegan restaurant grilling bison burgers on his back deck."You ask a room full of people: 'Do you love to drive?' and most people actually would raise their hand" he said while he drove. "But if we ask the question a slightly different way 'Do you love commuting? Do you love driving on your commute?' I think most people would say. 'Eh not so much.'"That's the problem Waymo is trying solve he said. The company doesn't want to do away with driving altogether just the driving that's unpleasant and boring he explained. Starting soon Waymo will be making its driverless van rides available to the public in Arizona. From there the roll out of the service will happen gradually."It's going to be a long long time before someone takes my hands off the steering wheel of a car" he said. "That's just not something that's going to happen in the short term."It's not only that he personally doesn't want to give up driving. He actually doesn't even think it's possible for Waymo or any company to entirely replace human drivers in all conceivable scenarios — at least not in the foreseeable future. Human drivers aren't that hard to improve upon as Krafcik pointed out."I've got these two eyes. That's all I've got these two optical sensors and it's amazing that we can drive so well just with these simple optical sensors and they're augmented a little bit with these three pieces of glass otherwise known as mirrors and this is my full complement of sensing technology" he said.On top of that a human driver's optical sensors are attached to only one brain. Each human must learn to drive on his or her own. A Waymo driverless van has video cameras laser and radar that can see and sense things in all directions around the vehicle continuously. And the cars learn from the experience of every other Waymo car creating as Krafcik puts it "the world's most experienced driver." Each day the Waymo driver adds another 25000 miles to its pool of experience more than the average person covers in two years.But that doesn't mean the technology is perfect. Krafcik parked his 1993 Porsche at Alice's Restaurant about 30 minutes from Waymo's headquarters. I had suggested someplace closer knowing he's a busy executive and probably pressed for time. But like I said he likes to drive. We sat outside with a couple of sodas and a box of fries and talked about what automated cars even with all those sensors and all that experience won't be able to do. Engineers talk about L5 or Level 5 autonomous driving. That's as autonomous as any vehicle could possibly be. At L5 you could get into a car at any time under any weather conditions and say "Take me...." anywhere. But L5 is impossible said Krafcik."That's a somewhat unreasonable expectation" he said "and it's sort of not even necessary because we so rarely drive from San Francisco to Santiago Chile. We just don't do that."The highest level of automation you can buy now is Level 3 at best. That means the car can drive itself in certain conditions such as on a multi-lane highway but with a human driver always paying attention and ready to take over.Waymo cars will operate in designated areas on familiar roads. Those designated areas will widen over time covering more places. But Krafcik doesn't foresee a day when the need for human drivers will be entirely obviated. But that need will diminish.Even then though no one will take the steering wheel from Krafcik's hands. Not even his own company's creations.,Business
London (CNN)When my Aunt Nicki visits me in London we avoid musical theater and the cinema. Aunt Nicki is hard of hearing. Although there are many enhanced listening devices available to help her such as an Assistive Living amplifier or a closed captioning screen that sits in a cup holder she tells me they don't work well enough.When I recently tried on the new "smart caption glasses" at the Royal National Theatre I had her on my mind. The theater is testing a pilot program for the technology for all performances of Hadestown and War Horse through October. It plans to make the glasses available for all of its performances during the 2019 season.The headset manufactured by Epson in partnership with the Royal National Theatre is heavier than normal reading glasses but much lighter than bulky virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift. The lenses look like a typical pair of glasses but they fit inside a large gray casing that sits on the sides of your head. When you look through the glasses closed captions scroll across the bottom of the augmented reality lenses. A handheld keypad is attached to the glasses via cable to allow each user to customize the color size and position of the closed captions. Changing the positioning of the text is key for user comfort. The biggest challenge is finding the sweet spot of balancing the captions in the foreground with the theater performance in the background. Here's how it works: The script from an opening-night production is fed into speech software which follows the performance and adjusts the captions accordingly. This process is refined using sound video and lighting cues.  "If a performer jumps a few lines the system will react" said Jonathan Suffolk the technical director for the Royal National Theatre. "It will take a second or two but the system will react and it will recognize where it is."Suffolk said some hard of hearing users wear it so they can read lips at the same time as reading the captions. The glasses are free for attendees and available at every performance. It's a major improvement on existing open captioning which unlike closed captioning are always in view. This typically includes large screens displaying captions."The response has been overwhelmingly positive for deaf theater-goers who would like to come into the theater anytime they want" Suffolk said of its recent trial. "It's really fundamental that organizations like the National Theatre -- in its really privileged position -- does this type of work for the entire sector."Richard France -- who works for a group called Deafinitely Theatre which creates performances for both the deaf and hearing communities -- has worked with many different technologies but calls the smart glasses a potential game changer. "I'm used to going to the theater with captions in it but it's much more enjoyable with the glasses because I can follow the movement of the actors on the stage and they feel is more inclusive" France said.The technology has been successfully used in US movie theaters but the Royal National Theatre's challenges are greater because their performances are live.Advocates for the deaf caution there's no single device or system that will work for all members of the deaf community but say the availability of this type of device at every Royal National Theatre performance is as much a game changer as the actual technology. Sarina Roffé the former president of the National Cued Speech Association believes it's a solid step toward making live performances more inclusive."This new technology allows the deaf and hard of hearing to have complete access" Roffé said. "It's really amazing how far we've advanced and how it has positively affected the quality of life for people who are deaf and hard of hearing."So perhaps the next time Aunt Nicki comes to London we'll be able to catch a show together.

Rita McGrath is a professor at Columbia Business School. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. In recent weeks we've seen how concentrated power and a lack of diverse perspectives on corporate boards can cause systemic blind spots in organizations and lead them into avoidable crises.Facebook for instance is currently in the crosshairs of regulators business partners and users after damning reports came to light about its reaction to a drumbeat of bad news. Carlos Ghosn's devastating fall from the upper echelons at Nissan has thrown both the auto maker and its longtime partner Renault into crisis and has cast doubts on the structure of corporate governance in Japan. And his behavior as an "imperial CEO" led to Jeff Immelt parting ways with GE heralding a corporate meltdown of epic proportions. These are just some of the most recent and visible examples of how power — particularly absolute power with few checks and balances — can presage a crisis. Here's how absolute power can lead a company down a self-destructive path:Shrinks cognitive bandwidthPractices such as having the same person serve as chairman and CEO failing to give decision making power to truly independent directors and selecting directors from the same tired pool of contenders are all likely to increase the chances that corporate leadership will miss something important in the external environment. By definition the number of perspectives weighing in on decisions are reduced if the diversity of the people making consequential decisions is limited. Moreover research suggests that more homogenous teams (as one finds when only a small group of people — or even a single individual — is in power) perform more poorly when tasks involve imagination creativity and out-of-the-box problem solving. Precisely because it is harder to come to an agreement on information and its implications more diverse teams do a better job.  Discourages sharing uncomfortable news The people most likely to encounter evidence that the world is changing tend not to be comfortably seated in corporate headquarters. They are at what the late businessman Andy Grove long ago called the "edges" of the organization. It's the person at Facebook who first noticed something strange going on with accounts that could be traced to Russian operatives only for Facebook's then-security chief to be met by anger from the top of the company when he shared early findings in a conference room deliciously named "only good news" according to The New York Times. It's the whistleblower at Nissan who pointed out that all did not seem well with respect to the car company's books. And they're the external analysts looking at GE's businesses and wondering whether something wasn't "broken" over there despite corporate management's denials that anything was problematic at all. Enables self-interested decisions  When power is overconcentrated in a few players executives have the latitude to take actions that are comfortable for themselves but not necessarily consistent with the good of the organization or the people in it. While this should be obvious we still see many examples of how long-term decisions are colored by the outcomes that will reward the most powerful even if they prove negative in the longer term.This can take the form of outright criminal behavior as the allegations against Carlos Ghosn — which he has denied — imply. Or it can take the form of claiming generous retirement payments stock options and access to company resources as has apparently happened with Jeff Immelt who used a spare plane for travel until 2014 according to GE. During his tenure GE's decisions to buy back its own stock (which has the effect of strengthening the share price) were blamed for contributing to GE's cash problem.Or it can take the form of prioritizing advertising revenue over the protection of a user's confidential information and strict adherence to the law. According to a complaint filed by the Housing and Urban Development Department Facebook for instance has promised advertisers it won't show housing ads to people in protected classes such as the disabled who might need certain accessibility which is considered housing discrimination and actually illegal (and for which the company is being sued — Facebook said it would address HUD's concerns). Given these obvious drawbacks why are so many organizations working under governance structures that expose them to these risks? One reason is that good governance challenging group discussions and quests to find real information is hard. It takes time and effort to identify and recruit diverse board members. It can feel uncomfortable to insist that the influence of more powerful people be reduced. And bringing women and underrepresented groups into the conversation means the conversation itself is likely to be different. Nonetheless it's an effort worth making — unless you want your organization to star in the next set of shocking corporate headlines.,Business
Inside Access only on CNN Business goes behind the scenes of the world's most innovative companies. The multimedia series went inside Richard Branson's Virgin empire and premiered live from Mojave California on November 30 2018.Miami (CNN Business)Richard Branson says Virgin Galactic is on the verge of a major achievement: It will send astronauts into space by Christmas.The billionaire entrepreneur told CNN Business' Rachel Crane this week he is "pretty confident" his space tourism venture can achieve its milestone by the end of the year. "We have a brilliant group of astronauts who literally believe 100% in the project and give it their everything" he said. The first few trips to space will be flown by test pilots without anyone else on board. Branson says he will be the first passenger. Eventually paying tourists will also make the trip."I'm not allowed up until the [test pilots] have broken it in a few times first" he said. "I would love to have gone on this very [first] flight but [pilots] are incredibly brave people."SpaceShipTwo Galactic's rocket-powered plane will fly into space after it detaches from beneath the wing of a mothership. It has been thoroughly tested on the ground and at lower altitudes Branson said. But the first few flights to space will be "the dangerous ones."The pilots will fly the space plane at at 2300 miles per hour accelerating to top speed in about eight seconds Branson said.Earlier this year the company resumed powered test flights of the rebuilt SpaceShipTwo named VSS Unity. The latest test in July sent the craft to a peak altitude of 32.3 miles. The goal is to send VSS Unity more than 50 miles above Earth high enough to earn passengers astronaut wings from the US government.If Virgin Galactic reaches space before the year is done it'll put Branson's venture ahead of its direct competitor Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. Founded in 2000 Blue Origin also plans to offer paying customers suborbital flights. Galactic could also beat Elon Musk's SpaceX — which has a booming business making unmanned trips to orbit and is gearing up to fly astronauts to the International Space Station next year."Safety's all that matters if you're putting people into space" he said. "So none of us will race to be the first."But he added "Virgin Galactic will be the first.""Elon's done extraordinary things. We hope to do extraordinary things. Jeff I'm sure will do extraordinary things" Branson said. "The demand for space travel whether it's satellites putting people into space is enormous...So exciting times ahead."The design and flight control systems of SpaceShipTwo were overhauled following a 2014 test flight crash that killed a co-pilot. Branson has said the accident made him question whether to continue pursuing his riskiest business venture. But the company said it received an outpouring of support including from customers who had reserved $200000 to $250000 tickets to one day ride in SpaceShipTwo. Hundreds of people are still lined up for a shot.The flight will offer tourists a few minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth's curved horizon.It's not clear when Virgin Galactic will be fully operational.Branson is known to set deadlines that aren't met. Virgin Galactic has been developing SpaceShipTwo since 2004 and Branson initially said commercial rides would begin in 2007. Eleven years later the firm is still working on getting its 600 customers into space."Space is difficult. Rocket science is rocket science" Branson said. "I obviously would love to prove our critics wrong and I'm reasonably confident that before Christmas we will do so. I think once we're in space we'll obviously need to do a number of other test flights before I go up and then before we start putting the ... astronauts who signed up to go into space with us."Correction: An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated the speed of SpaceShipTwo and the number of customers Virgin has lined up for travel.,Business
New York (CNN Business)The New York Times bet more than a year ago that it could convince an audience of foodies to pay for a standalone section devoted to all things cooking.About 120000 subscriptions later the newspaper thinks it has proven that NYT Cooking is not just another flash in the pan. The Times isn't shy about touting its success: The newspaper recently announced that it surpassed four million total subscriptions. But persuading a sizable chunk of those people to sign up for a separate food website was no small feat.  NYT Cooking charges $5 a month for access to its coverage. That's a relatively big ask in an age when just about every form of entertainment has a monthly fee attached to it and when amateur cooks already have access to countless recipes on the internet for free. Notably the Cooking section is not included in a basic $15-a-month digital subscription to the Times. Cooking enthusiasts either have to pay the extra $5 for access or subscribe to a pricier Times bundle. That meant the Cooking staff had to come up with a product that was worth the cost of entry. According to editor Sam Sifton the strategy for the section's current iteration was years in the making. "The idea was based in history really" Sifton told CNN Business. He traced it back to the 1960s when food editor Craig Claiborne amassed a bunch of Times recipes and assembled them into his own cookbook. The book was a bestseller — for Claiborne at least. The book belonged to him and the newspaper didn't profit. "We had this notion that we could build a digital version of what was 'The New York Times Cook Book'" Sifton added referencing the title of Claiborne's book. "But this time we'd own it."So Sifton and his team got to work and curated decades of Times recipes they deemed suitable for a modern cooking app. There were a few duds they passed over — the '70s microwave recipes aren't at the top of Sifton's list — but many others were classics that deserved another look."Each one of these things we are interrogating and retesting and trying to figure out so that we're not beholden to whatever the food trend was then" Sifton said. For example the Cooking staff dusted off a recipe for an original plum torte creation from Times food columnist Marian Burros that the newspaper published every September from 1983 until 1989. The torte was re-baked and photographed for inclusion on the app. Sifton said recipes like those were chosen because they had become indelible in the minds of Times readers. When the Cooking app launched in September 2014 it featured 16000 recipes available at no charge. There were plenty of other flourishes to encourage reuse such as the ability to save recipes or search for meals by keyword. All of those features along with a regular newsletter helped Cooking develop a user base for when the company began charging for the service three years later. In addition to the 120000 paid subscriptions the Times says about three million people now subscribe to its main Cooking newsletter which doesn't require a subscription. It has also grown its recipe library to about 19000. The team has been tinkering with other ways to promote the brand. It launched another newsletter in September focused on providing readers with a series of weeknight dishes to cook. That newsletter now has 86000 subscribers.Cooking has also partnered with Wirecutter a product recommendations website owned by The New York Times Company to provide tips on how to find the best pressure cooker. And until recently the section offered a meal kit service through Chef'd a company that is now defunct. Sifton says he's still expanding his team. He just hired two new editors to assign and edit recipes work on special projects and focus on social media. He also snagged cook and author Alison Roman as a columnist in the summer. Roman was a Times contributor whose chocolate shortbread cookie recipe went viral earlier this year. And then there's video. This year Cooking brought on two people to beef up its video presence both of whom used to work at Tasty the division of BuzzFeed made popular by its Facebook cooking videos. Sifton said those hires shouldn't be read as an effort to replicate what Tasty has done. He said his team is instead focused on figuring out how to use video to expand the audience for Cooking's archive of quality recipes."I don't think you're going to see top-down videos of cheese-stuffed deep-fried chicken Oreos" Sifton added. "That's not the direction." He cited Cooking's recent Thanksgiving coverage as an example of its ambitions including the smorgasbord of recipes it published earlier this month. The photos of the apple ombre and striped berry pies looked tantalizing enough in print. But online readers were steered to videos that showed them exactly how to pipe the topping onto the sweet potato meringue or create a lattice crust for the cranberry herringbone. Another digital package featured videos of Times food columnist Melissa Clark recreating an entire Thanksgiving meal with her family.There are more plans on the horizon. Sifton said Cooking is going to build its own test kitchen something the company hasn't had for decades. And when asked if the team would ever consider their own cooking show NYT Cooking Vice President Amanda Rottier didn't rule it out. "We're trying to establish Cooking as a standalone brand to increase our subscription business. I can imagine that extending in a lot of different ways" she told CNN Business. "I think shows is an interesting place that we would love to explore or experiment with down the line."The Times declined to disclose how much it spends to market Cooking. But Rottier said the team has been building a marketing operation. She added that Cooking promotes the brand through social media its newsletters internet search results and by leveraging its relationship with the rest of the Times.Whatever Cooking does to build awareness of its brand it's all in the service of convincing more people to pay for the product. Sifton said the rise of subscription models of all types are actually good for Cooking since that conditions people to pay for content. And then there's the newspaper's ultimate value proposition: It's the Times. It should be worth the money because the company has spent several decades building enough of a reputation to justify it. "Look you're really competing for people's time" Rottier said. "If you're someone who loves to cook and you want to spend money on that then Cooking is the place to do that.",Business
New York  (CNN Business)Dolce & Gabbana needs to clean up the mess it made in China or get left out of the country's luxury boom. Over the past several days the Italian fashion line has been trying to manage a crisis caused by an ad campaign that critics called "disrespectful and racist." It's also reeling from offensive comments allegedly sent from co-founder Stefano Gabbana's personal Instagram account. The Italian designer has denied writing the messages.Fallout from the controversy has been swift and harsh. Celebrities called for a boycott. Chinese e-commerce sites pulled D&G products from their virtual shelves. The brand canceled a major fashion show in Shanghai that the ads which featured an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks were designed to promote. "This is a big brand crisis" said Tulin Erdem a professor of marketing at NYU's Stern business school. "Sometimes brands do recover ... but on a scale of 1-10 [this is] really high up."Alienating customers is always bad for business. But for luxury brands pushing away Chinese shoppers is a disaster. A taste for luxuryChinese consumers that abandoned luxury brands during a government crackdown on corruption Kering (KER) the owner of Gucci and Alexander McQueen said that sales in China soared 30% in the first half of 2018. French fashion house Hermes credited sales in the country for record profits over the same period. D&G is a private company that does not share its sales figures with the public. Overall Chinese consumers spend over $7 billion each year on luxury goods according to the consultancy McKinsey. That's nearly one-third of the global market.Dolce & Gabbana may have seen the Shanghai show as a way to win over those consumers. The company had promoted the canceled event with the hashtags #DGLovesChina and #DGTheGreatShow on its social media accounts. As criticism poured in co-founders Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana tried to explain their thinking. "Our dream was to bring to Shanghai a tribute event dedicated to China which tells our history and vision" the founders said in a statement posted to Instagram and Twitter on Wednesday. "It was not simply a fashion show but something that we created especially with love and passion for China." The company also said that Gabbana's account was hacked and that the offensive messages were unauthorized. "I love China and the Chinese Culture" Gabbana wrote on his personal account. "I'm so sorry for what happened." The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. Missing the mark Some didn't find the apologies sincere. Chinese-French model Estelle Chen who withdrew from the show wrote "you don't love China you love money" in an Instagram post tagging both the brand and Gabbana directly. Chinese consumers are particularly sensitive to criticism that goes viral online said Thomai Serdari a strategist in luxury marketing and branding who teaches at NYU's Stern business school. "People are really influenced by what's happening online" she said. "They do shop primarily online and they're excellent researchers" she said. They "have experience in the luxury market and they really know what they're buying." And the way young wealthy Chinese consumers are thinking about luxury is evolving said Sun Baohong a marketing professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. "Before it was more for showing off social status" she said. Now it's about "making a personal statement." Even if Dolce & Gabbana hadn't offended people with its ads she added it probably would have missed the mark with the campaign. "The ad is really showing a very old-fashioned" image of China she said. "Chinese consumers still love foreign brands but things are changing." Making amends Now D&G has to figure out how to win back Chinese consumers. "It's not going to happen overnight" said Andrew Gilman founder of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group. The brand will have to "find the biggest influencers they can ... [and] get back in their good graces" he said. The company must also share a consistent message across its social media platforms and any other channels it uses to communicate with customers he said.Moving forward it will have to do a better job of understanding Chinese culture. "You can be a global brand" Gilman said "but you have to have local sensitivities."CNN's Ivana Kottasová Stephy Chung and Oscar Holland contributed to this report. ,Business
Parissa Haghirian is professor of Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.After his arrest Nissan removed Carlos Ghosn as chairman due to his suspected acts of financial misconduct: understating his income and misusing the company's assets. But the Nissan scandal is just the latest in a long line of mishaps to rock the Japanese corporate world. Other manufacturers such as Kobe Steel Takeda and Toray Industries have shocked the public in recent years admitting to violating safety rules or falsifying data. But the scandals are not only a shock to Japanese consumers — they leave a mark on Japan`s reputation as a reliable and quality-oriented manufacturer and business partner. Japanese corporate structures offer some explanations for the events.  No specialists In most Western companies employees are hired with a detailed work contract and only do what's agreed on in the contract. In Japan employees are hired with no job description and can be assigned any task.  Since there is no work division in most Japanese companies all employees can be transferred within a day to a new department or even location. Companies usually have employees change departments every two years. This job rotation allows company members to know the basic job functions in every part of the firm so by the time they become top managers they truly know the company inside-out. However this often means that many Japanese firms lack specialists since most managers had a short time to learn about particular business processes. And they're often not up to date when it comes to emerging business topics such as compliance diversity management or digitization.  Lifetime employment  Japanese companies provide lifetime employment and they expect employees to stay with them until retirement. In fact many Japanese are hired by their companies right after graduation and stay in their companies for their entire work lives. But a lifetime in the same company with the same colleagues makes it difficult to raise concerns and question existing processes. Even on company boards we find mainly Japanese managers know only one company and have spent decades working there. Often new international standards are recognized very late or not at all.  What's more new hires are trained in each department by older members or sempai who are role models and informal leaders at the same time. This creates a strong bond between employees but having such close-knit units and strict hierarchies makes it difficult for new ideas to flourish.  Labor laws Japanese labor law makes it difficult to fire full-time employees. They can stay in the same company until retirement and enjoy full protection by the law as long as they dedicate themselves fully to the firm and rotate throughout the company for the first 10 years of their career.  Many Japanese employees do not question internal processes because they cannot compare to processes in former work places or other companies. The one-company-per-lifetime system creates a strong bond between employee and firm and makes it difficult for employees to question or criticize internal processes even if they perceive them as wrong or unethical.  What's next? Now that trust in Japanese companies has been deeply shaken it's obvious that Japan needs to beef up corporate governance regulations.  The government has already taken some first steps. As of 2015 Japanese boards are supposed to have two external directors. Though the code itself isn't legally binding companies have to declare why they're not following it which puts pressure on them to do so. The government hopes diversifying traditional boards will lead to more innovative decision-making amongst board members.  Changes in Japanese society will also have an effect on Japanese companies. Japan is currently facing a very serious labor shortage because of a population decline. The unemployment rate is at a record low of 2.3% and companies regard recruiting as their biggest future challenge.  The Japanese government has reacted to this population decline by relaxing immigration laws and making it easier for international managers to enter Japanese firms. These international employees may bring more international perspectives as well as implement new procedures in traditional Japanese firms to make them more competitive on a global scale. In the coming years they may also influence attitude toward compliance and safety standards.  Furthermore whistleblowing has become more common in Japan in recent years. Many of the scandals in recent months have resulted in security risks for the Japanese population so more employees have begun reporting them to authorities.  The Nissan scandal is a wake-up call for Japanese companies to rethink their processes and install effective compliance management processes. We will see what they learn from it. ,Business
Mountain View California (CNN Business)John Krafcik downshifted his white Porsche 911 and whipped it around a curve on a heavily wooded mountain road. The car's 25-year-old engine made its distinctive soft rumble behind us as he accelerated out toward the next turn. For a few moments we stopped talking. I was enjoying the drive but also the pleasant irony of it. That's because Krafcik is the CEO of Waymo the self-driving car division of Google's parent company Alphabet.I first got to know Krafcik years ago when he was the head of Hyundai Motor America. Before that he had worked at Ford. He owns a small collection of cars that includes two Porsches (neither particularly high-end) a souped up Volvo wagon and a little known bare-bones British sports car called a Caterham. These aren't cars for showing off. These are cars for driving. Because John Krafcik loves to drive. He makes no secret about it and he sees no conflict. This is not like the owner of a vegan restaurant grilling bison burgers on his back deck."You ask a room full of people: 'Do you love to drive?' and most people actually would raise their hand" he said while he drove. "But if we ask the question a slightly different way 'Do you love commuting? Do you love driving on your commute?' I think most people would say. 'Eh not so much.'"That's the problem Waymo is trying solve he said. The company doesn't want to do away with driving altogether just the driving that's unpleasant and boring he explained. Starting soon Waymo will be making its driverless van rides available to the public in Arizona. From there the roll out of the service will happen gradually."It's going to be a long long time before someone takes my hands off the steering wheel of a car" he said. "That's just not something that's going to happen in the short term."It's not only that he personally doesn't want to give up driving. He actually doesn't even think it's possible for Waymo or any company to entirely replace human drivers in all conceivable scenarios — at least not in the foreseeable future. Human drivers aren't that hard to improve upon as Krafcik pointed out."I've got these two eyes. That's all I've got these two optical sensors and it's amazing that we can drive so well just with these simple optical sensors and they're augmented a little bit with these three pieces of glass otherwise known as mirrors and this is my full complement of sensing technology" he said.On top of that a human driver's optical sensors are attached to only one brain. Each human must learn to drive on his or her own. A Waymo driverless van has video cameras laser and radar that can see and sense things in all directions around the vehicle continuously. And the cars learn from the experience of every other Waymo car creating as Krafcik puts it "the world's most experienced driver." Each day the Waymo driver adds another 25000 miles to its pool of experience more than the average person covers in two years.But that doesn't mean the technology is perfect. Krafcik parked his 1993 Porsche at Alice's Restaurant about 30 minutes from Waymo's headquarters. I had suggested someplace closer knowing he's a busy executive and probably pressed for time. But like I said he likes to drive. We sat outside with a couple of sodas and a box of fries and talked about what automated cars even with all those sensors and all that experience won't be able to do. Engineers talk about L5 or Level 5 autonomous driving. That's as autonomous as any vehicle could possibly be. At L5 you could get into a car at any time under any weather conditions and say "Take me...." anywhere. But L5 is impossible said Krafcik."That's a somewhat unreasonable expectation" he said "and it's sort of not even necessary because we so rarely drive from San Francisco to Santiago Chile. We just don't do that."The highest level of automation you can buy now is Level 3 at best. That means the car can drive itself in certain conditions such as on a multi-lane highway but with a human driver always paying attention and ready to take over.Waymo cars will operate in designated areas on familiar roads. Those designated areas will widen over time covering more places. But Krafcik doesn't foresee a day when the need for human drivers will be entirely obviated. But that need will diminish.Even then though no one will take the steering wheel from Krafcik's hands. Not even his own company's creations.,Business
In Isaac Larian's Los Angeles office there's a crowded shelf of framed $1 $5 and $100 bills signed by people who have waged bets against him on a product's success and have lost. "We're running out of room" jokes Larian. The 64-year-old billionaire founder and CEO of toy maker MGA Entertainment has notched some pretty big wins over the years including the launch of the wildly popular Bratz dolls in 2001 the acquisition of the Little Tikes toy brand in 2006 and more recently the release of the L.O.L. Surprise toys. But as much as he loves proving his naysayers wrong defeat hits him equally hard.It happened this past May when Larian lost his $675 million bid But Toys 'R' Us' creditors who ended up with control of the company rejected his offer forcing Larian to withdraw. While the specifics of the decision were not disclosed the creditors later said in a filing that they believed the company was worth more than the offer price. "It really made me very sad. I was depressed" says Larian. "We were very serious about the offer and spent thousands of dollars in time and effort negotiating." If the deal with Toys 'R' Us had gone through Larian had planned to turn the stores into a "mini Disneyland-like experience." "When my kids were young we would take them on weekends to Toys 'R Us. It wasn't to buy something every time. It was for the joy of playing with toys" says Larian.In his vision "kids could come to the stores touch play and experience the toys and have fun" says Larian who recently became a grandfather for the first time. "Parents wouldn't have to buy something just to be there."But Larian hasn't totally given up on the idea."Who knows? Maybe I will do it myself" he says. "Now there is big opportunity there for someone else to come along and fill this gap left by Toys 'R' Us."From Tehran to Los AngelesLarian grew up in the slums of Tehran where he didn't get to have many of the experiences that he hopes to create for kids today. His father had a small shop selling textiles and he put his son to work restocking inventory and collecting payments from customers. "I was working since I was nine years old. I'd go to school then to the shop then do my homework and sleep. I really didn't have much of a childhood other than that" says Larian.  His one escape was to watch Hollywood movies. "That was my idea of America" he says. By the time he was 17 he convinced his parents to send him to the United States in search of better opportunities. They borrowed $753 from his uncles and bought him a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. It was 1971 and Larian arrived alone with a suitcase and a yellow blanket that his mother gave him."I was scared. I was still a child at 17" says Larian. "I didn't speak English and I had no place to stay ... I would walk around the city crying and hungry because I was almost out of money and couldn't find a job."With the help of a friend he found an apartment. He eventually found work as a dishwasher at a coffee shop earning $1.65 an hour. He would later become a busboy then a waiter.After saving for almost a year Larian enrolled part-time at Los Angeles Southwest College a local community college."I took classes at the college and like many immigrants picked up on American [English] by clichés through watching television and movies" he says. He later transferred to California State University.Larian graduated in 1978 from California State University with a civil engineering degree but he soon realized he had other ambitions."I knew I was meant to be an entrepreneur. It's what I learned working in my father's shop in Iran" says Larian.'Fortune favors the bold'Larian soon launched a small mail-order business called Surprise Gift Wagon that sold imported decorative brass products from Asia. "I was working out of my apartment" he says. "In about nine months my sales were about $30000."Shortly afterward he also started selling imported electronics such as handheld video games. By the late 1980s the company became the first official distributor of Nintendo's Game and Watch handheld videogames in the US and Larian changed the company's name to Micro Games of America. By the late 1990s the company's portfolio of products had expanded even further and the company's name was changed again to MGA Entertainment. It was around this time that a toy inventor named Joe Trushus showed Larian a prototype of a talking doll. In 1997 the Singing Bouncy Baby doll became the first toy hit for the company.But Larian's biggest breakthrough came in 2001 with the launch of Bratz dolls. In just five years the dolls turned into a billion-dollar global phenomenon with fans dubbing the edgy multi-ethnic Bratz as the "anti-Barbie." At its peak Bratz accounted for as much as 75% of MGA's total sales says Larian. But Bratz's success was stymied by a legal battle with Mattel over who owned the brand. Mattel claimed the inventor Carter Bryant developed the idea for Bratz when he was still a Mattel employee. During the protracted legal battle the court said MGA was not allowed to sell the doll which hurt the company's sales.A jury ultimately ruled in MGA's favor in 2011 and the company began to sell Bratz again.This past summer Larian also offered to buy rival Mattel but the toymaker dismissed the idea. In letters exchanged with outgoing Mattel Chairman Christopher Sinclair Larian suggested a merger of the two companies for an undisclosed price. "The Mattel board unanimously concluded that this proposal is not in the best interests of Mattel and its shareholders" Sinclair said in response to Larian. "Mattel is not interested in further discussing the matter with you."Since the legal tussle with Mattel ended MGA has expanded its portfolio. It is now the largest privately-held toy company in the US and generates annual sales of more than $1 billion according to Larian. The company is also profitable but Larian declined to disclose its profits.Looking back at his entrepreneurial journey Larian is reminded of a favorite saying. "Fortune favors the bold" he says. "I can do whatever I want. And what I want is to keep innovating. Innovation is what's vital to our industry." ,Business
Dr. John Lee is senior fellow at the Hudson Institute (Washington) and United States Studies Centre (Sydney) and an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own. (CNN)At the post G20 Summit in Buenos Aires US President Donald Trump held what the White House called a "very successful meeting" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed that current US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports of 10% will remain unchanged for 90 days. Tariffs were due to be raised to 25% on January 1.According to the White House there will be a substantial increase in American exports to China of agricultural energy industrial and other products which will reduce the trade deficit in favor of China. The White House statement declares both sides will begin negotiations to resolve differences on forced technology transfer intellectual property protection non-tariff barriers cyber intrusions and cyber theft.Chinese state media reported Sunday that the two countries had reached "consensus on economic and trade issues" and that "healthy and stable economic and trade relations conform to common interests of the two countries and the whole world."The reality is far more unsettling especially for China. We are merely entering the next phase of what will be an enduring economic competition between the world's two largest economies. For America the next 90 days is about assessing testing how much further China is prepared to compromise. For China it must rethink its fundamental negotiating strategy and time is running out.Consider how China has played this game. When Trump first flagged his seriousness about tariffs China promised to retaliate with its own measures in a tit-for-tat response. Surely American firms would not tolerate increased parts and products from China which would dilute their profit margins. American consumers care more about how much they pay for their latest gadget than where it is made or assembled.Besides the widespread Chinese assumption was that talk of a trade war was sparked by the President's obsession with current account deficits. In May China apparently agreed to measures to reduce the then $375 billion surplus it enjoyed with respect to two-way trade with America even if there was disagreement about the size of the reduction. Send negotiators to work out ad hoc agreements for China to buy more American products and economic relations will continue in the same way as it had been before Trump came into power.That was China's negotiating strategy: threaten retaliatory pain for American firms and consumers and shrink the trade surplus with America. A distracted and divided as American democracy would force Trump to call a truce. Beijing miscalculated.To China's horror Trump seems to believe his own rhetoric that trade wars are good and easy to win especially when one is buying more from another country than selling to them. Washington has since made it not just about reducing the deficit but at attack on Beijing's supposed industrial policy and objectives.This includes the "Made in China 2025" blueprint which is based on the twin pillars of Chinese "self-sufficiency" and Chinese domination of global exports in these sectors. To get there America has accused China of blatant intellectual property theft and policies which offer the latter's national champions and preferred domestic firms all manner of unfair disadvantages such as subsidies tax breaks and protection from foreign competition in Chinese markets.If China is indeed guilty of these accusations then it must delay its political and economic objective to become a "moderately prosperous society" by 2021 and a fully developed economy by 2049. If China is not Trump has nevertheless placed the burden of proof on China to demonstrate that it plays according to the rules.Meanwhile inside China Xi is being accused of triumphalism and unnecessarily picking fights with America. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen almost 30% since the beginning of the year and the trade troubles come at a time when China is trying to de-leverage its economy while maintaining growth at the 6.5% target at the same time.Xi will be desperate to avoid the tariff increase on its imports to America from 10% to 25% in 90 days' time. But offering to help increase American goods into China has only temporarily staved off the threatened 25% tariff at the beginning of 2019 -- and then only for 90 days. The pain for China is far from over and Xi might have to walk back his grand economic plans for the country.  In contrast Trump has the benefit of a still buoyant stock market and a booming American economy to cushion damage inflicted by China.How will he use his advantage? In his book The Art of the Deal which was released in 1987 Trump wrote "My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after." And he has further room to move. Getting tough on China economically is perhaps his only main policy for which there is broad Democratic support significant as the latter has won control of the House in the recent Midterms.If Trump wanted to discombobulate China he has achieved that. But it is only a tactical and transient advantage. The problem remains lack of clarity with respect to objectives: going after Chinese intellectual property violations greater access for American firms in China discouraging distorting subsidies to state-owned enterprises and national champions challenging Chinese plans to dominate industries as laid out in "Made in China 2025" disentangling critical American supply chains from reliance on China or simply reducing the trade deficit.  In Buenos Aires leaders of the other G20 countries stood warily on the sidelines as they have largely done so far. They would not disagree with Trump's insistence on free fair and reciprocal trade and Trump needs other advanced economies such as the European Union nations and Japan on his side in this fight.Yet to convince that it is about more than punishing China or gaining special advantages for only American firms Trump has 90 days to make his case not just to China but to the world.,Opinion
Mariska Hargitay is the founder and president of the Joyful Heart Foundation and the Emmy Award-winning star of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)Much has been written this year about women's anger -- its power and potential its evolution and necessity. But beneath the analysis there is the feeling itself: anger pure and simple. It's what I felt when I read CNN's report about the destruction -- the outrageous careless wrongheaded uneducated ill-informed dangerous willful destruction -- of rape kits. I have been engaged in the work to bring an end to sexual violence since 2004 the year I started the Joyful Heart Foundation which aims to heal and empower sexual assault survivors. But in truth my work goes back even further -- to the moment I learned some of the statistics about sexual assault and domestic violence in preparation for my role on "Law & Order: SVU."For example in the United States one in three women and one in six men are survivors of sexual violence. One in four women and one in seven men have suffered severe violence from an intimate partner. Those numbers alone almost made my head explode. I had that feeling again when I first learned about the backlog of untested rape kits in 2009 after a report from Human Rights Watch. I couldn't wrap my mind around it: thousands of rape kits sitting in some cases rotting in police storage facilities across the country. As Polly Poskin executive director of the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault has said "If you've got stacks of physical evidence of a crime and you're not doing everything you can with the evidence then you must be making a decision that this isn't a very serious crime." Beyond the obvious threat to public safety beyond the wasted opportunities to both prosecute the guilty and exonerate the wrongly convicted the backlog sends a devastating and inexcusable message to survivors: You don't matter. What happened to you doesn't matter. And if the backlog wasn't enough the destruction of rape kits now brings our country's attitude toward sexual assault and its victims into even sharper focus. Explore CNN's investigative report and you will learn about 99 agencies in 47 states destroying rape kits. About a detective in North Carolina who authorized the trashing of a rape kit a month after it was collected from a woman who was gang raped because the investigator didn't believe her. And about records showing kits were trashed as recently as 2016 -- with one of the objectives being to "make space in the evidence room." That is an outrageous shameful level of disregard and the system that makes it possible must change. Just as the backlog is a reflection of how we regard sexual assault and its victims in this country the individual actions and decisions by law enforcement are the outcome of deeply entrenched societal attitudes that make those actions and decisions possible. Those attitudes must be dismantled. And what must change are the laws governing the handling of rape kits. As CNN reports last year the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations for best practices about the counting tracking and testing of rape kits reforms that the federal government agrees are needed. In order to be able to hold jurisdictions accountable those recommendations must become law in all 50 states. Legally requiring the testing of rape kits and prohibiting the destruction of rape kits ensures that every survivor gets the same standard of care and rights. Importantly each survivor should also have the right -- by law -- to know the status of their rape kit and have the option of having it preserved for as long as they want. It is important to note that systemic and lasting change takes effect through state-level legislation. While agency local and county-level reforms are vital we know that perpetrators do not stop at the county limits and survivors' access to justice should not be restricted by zip code. Progress has already been made to be sure. In the last two years alone we and our partners have helped pass 34 laws to change the way rape kits are handled and are already working on legislation for 2019. Through endthebacklog.org the first and only comprehensive online hub for information about the rape kit backlog in the United States we are sharing best practices progress on reform and a way for people to join this growing effort. I also had the great privilege of telling survivors' stories who have kits in the backlog in "I Am Evidence" the documentary I produced in partnership with HBO which continues to be shown in communities across the country. In the work to bring this violence to an end -- that is the vision to which we must commit -- stark reminders like this important report from CNN confront us with how much work is left to be done. While the report's content angers me deeply perhaps that anger is not pure and simple. It also contains a renewed resolve a reminder of how much is at stake in our work and a deepened determination to create the more just society we all seek. ,Opinion
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)Three fiercely determined women with little else in common seized the spotlight this week.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who was elected to Congress from the Bronx; Maria Lila Meza Castro whose image as she fled tear gas at the border went viral; and Meghan Duchess of Sussex.Call them sisters under fire:Ocasio-Cortez has yet to be sworn in but she is already Fox News' favorite trigger wrote Dean Obeidallah.  It's "'Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome'" he writes: They can't stop talking about her "from her choice of footwear to the type of apartment she can afford to the alleged impending doom she presents for America."  With Hillary Clinton on the sidelines "a young brown Latina woman is the new 'villain' Fox News needs to keep viewers tuned in." Maria Lila Meza Castro slogged her way with thousands of others from Honduras to the United States border hoping to cross at Tijuana and seek asylum. Instead she was hit with tear gas and the photograph of her -- wearing a T-shirt from the American film "Frozen" as she pulled two little girls to safety -- became an instant symbol. The cruel irony is that the movie "celebrates freedom and empowerment" noted Yalda T. Uhls. "Unfortunately ... she is unlikely to ever realize the dreams celebrated by the two characters beaming out from her T-shirt -- at least not in 2018 America." Do the British media have it in for the Duchess of Sussex? Sure looks that way observed Jane Merrick. The gushing coverage of the royal wedding has given way to tabloid trashing of the former American actress as "a demanding bridezilla in the run-up to the wedding and a difficult boss" who demanded an emerald tiara and even made her sister-in-law Kate cry.  It's unfair and an "apparent effort to 'other' her -- perhaps due to her being American but also in a more insidious way over her biracial heritage" Merrick wrote. Cut her a break she says.  Why '41' will be missedAmerica's 41st President George H.W. Bush died Friday. Aaron David Miller recounted a phone call he received from the President when he worked in Bush's state department.  It showed he wrote Bush's character and another essential quality: curiosity. While Bush's "mission in life was certainly driven by personal ambition it was always tethered to a broader goal of service and obligation to a nation he loved. Together with the passing of John McCain Bush's death reminds us of what's often missing in today's politics -- the service and bipartisanship required to lead a nation through difficult times."  Trump is right to worry about Cohen "It is easy to see why (Donald Trump) is so visibly flustered" wrote former federal prosecutor Elie Honig. On Thursday Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to lying to Congress about Trump's Russia dealings.  "Trump took a few swipes at Cohen calling Cohen 'very weak' and accusing Cohen of 'lying.' This is Cooperator Bashing 101 -- standard textbook stuff from a frightened target of a criminal probe. As Trump seems to understand cooperating witnesses often pose the gravest threat to the leaders of closed corrupt hierarchical organizations." The implications mount. "Did Trump's hiring of (Paul) Manafort as campaign chair for no salary have anything to do with Manafort's deep ties to pro-Vladimir Putin Russian oligarchs?" And where does the Russian state's effort to hack Hillary Clinton and the DNC's e-mails fit in? If Cohen knows it now Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller does too Honig says. Earlier in the week Mueller's cooperation deal with Manafort collapsed after Manafort was accused of lying to the special counsel's office ("incredibly reckless and self-defeating" opined Jeffrey Toobin). It's no setback for Mueller Honig says since "we know Mueller has the goods on whatever Manafort lied about." GM job cuts puncture the Trump narratives If Trump's presidency fails look to General Motors not Mueller as a precipitating cause suggested Mark Weinberg. On Monday GM announced it was closing five North American plants killing 14000 jobs. Trump whose steel and aluminum tariffs have cost the company $1 billion was furious.  If his economic policies are implicated Weinberg wrote it could represent "a stake in the heart of the Trump presidential experiment ... thousands of American autoworkers many who voted for Trump in 2016 -- believing he would protect their jobs -- now face a stark reality just weeks before the holidays." GM's move is a reality check wrote Megan McArdle in The Washington Post. "We no longer live in a country where what's good for big business is good for its workers or for its politicians. There may be no way back to such a place but if there is it's pretty clear that Trump doesn't have the map."  It's not likely GM does either wrote Detroit native Marc Osler; it is motivated by short-term gains for investors not long-term vision. The company will "roll out as many gas-guzzling Suburbans as Texas moms can buy. I don't believe for a second though that there is much chance that GM will eventually pivot to electric vehicles or autonomous cars."  The harsh truth: "Don't fall in love with GM. She will not love you back." The trouble with Beto-maniaBeto O'Rourke who failed to unseat Ted Cruz from the United States Senate told a crowd in El Paso on Monday that he may well run for president in 2020.  Consider this wrote Jill Filipovic. "A record number of women won races in the midterm election making the incoming Congress the most female and the most racially diverse in American history. So of course presidential speculation is all about the white guy who lost his Senate race." The truth is "we still understand executive power as male and so we continue to look to men to occupy it." More than three weeks after the midterm elections the country was still wrapping them up last week.In Mississippi the Republican Senate candidate Cindy Hyde-Smith won a runoff Tuesday after clinging tightly to Trump during a campaign marked by repeated race-related controversy.  Lamented Mississippi author Ralph Eubanks: "Tuesday night Mississippi had the opportunity to show the country that it had become a state that has shaken off its image as a closed society. "In the end it was Mississippi's past that won the election rather than its future." Burying climate change report backfiresWhy asked Ken Kimmell and Brenda Ekwurzel in The Guardian did the Trump administration try to bury its own scary climate report by releasing it on Black Friday? What's Trump a climate change skeptic hiding? the writers ask. That "it's here and now" and that its findings "make the case that the administration must stop rolling back the climate policies the previous administration put in place." Trump ignores this at the world's peril they note even as states cities and the private sector are stepping up with climate change strategies of their own. Alaskan Bernadette Demientieff saw confirmation in the report: "Many of our Native communities ... are living that reality daily" she wrote. "Alaska is ground zero for climate change."  And yet the Trump administration is pushing to open up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling.  The "dangerous collaboration of the fossil-fuel industry and the Trump administration are threatening our food security our traditions our cultural heritage and our very survival" she says. John Bolton's cowardiceJohn Bolton President Trump's national security adviser told reporters Tuesday he had a perfectly good reason not to listen to an audio recording of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's torture and murder in the Saudi Embassy in Turkey: He doesn't speak Arabic.  Earlier Trump explained to Fox News' Chris Wallace that he too did not want to listen because "It's a suffering tape. It's a terrible tape." Paul Begala offered "a word for those who when entrusted with leading our nation purposefully turn away from their duties because they are difficult or unpleasant: cowards." "What this sad story teaches us is they (Trump and Bolton) also don't speak the language of American values" Begala says. Khashoggi himself faced truth directly his daughters Noha and Razan Jamal Khashoggi reflected in the Washington Post. "It was vitally important to him to speak up to share his opinions to have candid discussions." They offer not a eulogy of their journalist dad but "a promise that his light will never fade that his legacy will be preserved within us." Washington Redskins should be ashamedReuben Foster was charged with domestic-violence battery in Tampa Bay Florida on Sunday and the San Francisco 49ers swiftly dumped him from their roster.  Three days later the Washington Redskins hired him.  Repulsive message received wrote Roxanne Jones. The "NFL continues to excuse misogyny and abuse against women." But this will backfire she says. "Women make up nearly 45% of the NFL fanbase" and often are the deciders for their kids' involvement.  "We know our power. If the league intends to keep women watching and spending on the NFL it cannot keep justifying guys like Reuben Foster."Seven minutes of terror and then...Piece of cake:  Point and shoot an $814 million spacecraft at Mars 300 million miles away then wait seven months for it to arrive and plunge at 12300 mph (and a precise 12-degree angle) through the planet's atmosphere and parachute gently to the featureless surface.What could possibly go wrong?  Nothing did. To cheers NASA's Mars probe InSight landed flawlessly Monday which is quite a thing wrote physicist Don Lincoln ahead of the landing: The planet is a "graveyard of failed probes" with 44 tries and 18 successes over the years.  Finding liquid water this time "would be the key discovery" says Lincoln and "very comforting to possible future explorers.",Opinion

Bush's death deeply affected me. When I first learned of his passing on Saturday morning I stared blankly at the television screen as the memory of a moment long ago abruptly flashed before me. While I did not work in the late president's administration our unexpected meeting -- on a stage at the FBI Academy in Quantico Virginia some 27 years ago -- forever impacted me.It was shortly before New Agent Class (NAC) 91-6 was scheduled to graduate from the FBI Academy in May of 1991. We were all excited to become freshly minted FBI special agents assigned -- according to the needs of the bureau -- across the country staffing field divisions large and small and soon to be imbued with sober and grave responsibilities enforcing federal law."I have some news for you -- both good and bad" our staff counselor supervisory special agent Don Peck noted during our final week of training. "Look" Peck continued "we're forced to push commencement services back two days" to audible groans from the class.Peck shot us a withering glare immediately silencing the murmuring of NAC 91-6. "The good news is that the President of the United States will provide your commencement address." The year 1991 could surely be considered quainter times. I knew none of my classmates' political affiliations nor did any of them know mine. And still we all broke into a spontaneous ovation.After all the President would be handing out our FBI badges and credentials.Though we lived in far less partisan times Bush had at least in part a political purpose in making an appearance in front of our class. He was in support of the Omnibus Anti-Crime Bill that Democrats and Republicans had been hotly debating in both chambers of Congress. Bush a Republican pushed for strengthening laws and giving police broader provisions related to obtaining evidence without court-authorized search warrants. Gun control sentencing guidelines and habeus corpus provision debates afforded the President the opportunity -- in front of a largely sympathetic law enforcement gathering at Quantico -- to have his voice heard on the issues. Shortly after the President's crisp enunciation of his policy desires I heard my name called and strode confidently across the stage shaking hands along the way with FBI Director William S. Sessions and Attorney General Richard Thornburgh. When I arrived in front of the President I straightened a bit extended my hand for the obligatory handshake photo-op and advised Bush that it was an honor to have him in attendance."Thank you son" the 41st President of the United States replied "I appreciate your commitment to this nation. Make us proud and congratulations.""Yes sir. I will" I responded. He softly patted my shoulder as I strode past him.And that was it. Fifteen words that I will never forget -- from a President who valued public service so deeply that he made time to be at my graduation. Those words have shaped my professional career across many decades. Bush deeply believed in the FBI motto of "Fidelity Bravery and Integrity." He'd lived those words during his adult life. Fidelity to his family and country. Bravery in the face of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis of the early 1940s. And integrity in every government assignment he handled. Quibble if you must with Bush on political issues but no one can question the man's integrity. His word was bond and his character unimpeachable -- virtues sadly in short supply these days. This humble man unknowingly shaped the conduct of a young callow and fresh-faced special agent on a stage he would likely not have recalled. And yet Bush forever changed my life on that bright clear morning in 1991. He was and ever shall remain for me an ordinary man who lived an extraordinary life.Rest in peace sir. ,Opinion

(CNN)As it turned out the contrast at this year's G20 conference of the world's most significant nations was as stark as possible. Following the news of President George H.W. Bush's death the difference between the late president's leadership as a unifier whose legacy was to preside over America's graceful exit from the Cold War and a deeply divisive President Donald Trump who has the potential of plunging the United States into a new cold war with the China of Xi Jinping was on full display.A severely wounded Trump managed to avert the most dire of consequences -- at least for the moment -- but wings clipped found his two days of summitry most noted for meetings that were avoided or canceled. In fact every one of Trump's potential landmines was there -- his autocratic friends Russia's Vladimir Putin Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman China's Xi; and democratic frenemies Canada's Justin Trudeau Germany's Angela Merkel France's Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Theresa May.In the end however there was only one encounter that truly mattered -- the dinner meeting between Trump and Xi. Fortunately Trump found it prudent to step back from the very edge of an abyss. Each leader is clearly enamored by what they see as the other's supreme power over his nation and world events. The one substantive difference is that Xi has no term limits while Trump has two or at most six years remaining in his tenure.And their minimal progress averted an immediate crisis. Trump and Xi agreed to allow their people to talk postponing for three months the January 1 deadline of crippling new American tariffs and setting up the stock market for at least a temporary relief rally Monday morning.At most of these G20 meetings it is less the vast plenary sessions that set the tone and provide the headlines than the one-on-one conferences or even the brief "pull-aside" conversations between the assembled leaders many with long dockets of grievances or issues to be explored.But this year most of these meetings were either removed or downsized at the last minute leaving Trump curiously muted -- perhaps quite astute moves by advisers anxious to avoid unfortunate headlines or worse from a personality rarely able to adapt to any diplomatic niceties. Of course for some there is also the feeling that spending too much time in close proximity to or extended conversation with Trump would be the diplomatic equivalent of playing with a live hand grenade. One never knows when the pin's been pulled. Still it's a pretty sad state of affairs when the smartest move Trump could make was canceling meetings -- with Putin for instance when a direct face-to-face confrontation might even have helped put a brake on Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and reclaiming of power in eastern Ukraine.Petulance is hardly a savory sauce to spice any international gathering. While Trump's foul moods all too often seem to have set the table at international gatherings most recently last month at the celebration of Veteran's Day in Paris this time he was scarcely visible to allow any dark clouds to gather. Apart from the suspension of the cold war with China there was little sense that the Trumpian agenda of America First and rest of the world be damned had changed one iota. Rather the rest of the world seems simply to have accepted the new normal from its onetime leader and moved on. Such an attitude toward Trump seemed to be how Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe opened his conversation with the American president on the first day of the G20: "I want to congratulate you on your historic victory in the midterm election in the United States." This set me to wondering whether Abe had been reading any reports at all from the American elections or had simply learned a vital lesson of dealing with his self-referential interlocutor.In the end while the United States refused to sign the G7 closing communique in June this year the other G20 signatories simply wrote in American exceptionalism to the document reflecting the view of much of the western world -- with the exception of the United States.This allowed all sides to claim at least a modicum of success. On trade the communique suggested it was a matter not of free trade but fair trade failing to speak out on protectionism while bowing to the American desire to reform the World Trade Organization which most countries recognize could use some touching up while not scrapping it entirely.Equally it allowed Trump a final swipe at a pet peeve on his way home telling reporters on Air Force One that he planned to begin the mechanism to pull out of NAFTA "shortly" giving the newly Democratic House and GOP-led Senate six months to approve his revised pact he signed in Buenos Aires."Today is a great day for the United States" a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing at the end of the G20. "Across the board it was really a resounding success." And the official went on to explain that there was other language the administration liked on everything from transparent trade financing to women's empowerment adding that the G20 even allowed the US to explain "why we are withdrawing from the job-killing Paris Agreement" on climate change -- while every other G20 nation committed to reinforcing and embracing its provisions.In short whatever victory the Trump administration might claim seemed to be for American exceptionalism rather than leadership. Quite a pyrrhic victory in the end -- and one the United States must find some way of overcoming if it is ever to assume any leadership role again.,Opinion

Bush have been pouring in even from some progressives who disagreed with many of his policies but expressed "great respect for his lifetime of service" to our nation. There's one more aspect of Bush's life that I believe deserves to be celebrated -- namely how the late President could laugh at himself.  In fact as President Bush even invited Dana Carvey who was then depicting him on "Saturday Night Live" to the White House annual Christmas party in 1992 to tell jokes at his expense. Can you imagine Donald Trump inviting Alec Baldwin to the White House to mock him?!  This may seem minor to some but Bush being able to laugh at himself showed us and the world that he was a secure well-adjusted person -- qualities you want to see in the leader of the free world. In fact after Carvey performed at the Christmas party Bush took to the stage and told the crowd "Dana has given me a lot of laughs." He then added a line that said so much about the late President: "And the fact that we can laugh at each other is a very fundamental thing." To be clear when Carvey was on "SNL" and even at the White House holiday party he was telling jokes that mocked and ridiculed Bush. Carvey often portrayed Bush in an unflattering light -- as a bumbling leader with wild hand gestures who was out of touch with the average American (a caricature that arguably hurt Bush when he lost his race for re-election in 1992).  For example in 1989 after the devastating Hurricane Hugo Bush was criticized by many for the federal relief effort being too slow. On "SNL" the following week there was Carvey as Bush telling America in his famously exaggerated Bush cadence "Hurricane Hugo ... doing that damage down there ... going round and round ... natural disaster." Then Carvey over-emphasizing Bush's cadence added "Not my fault" to big laughs from the audience. And in late 1991 with the economy slowing and Bush facing increasingly challenging re-election prospects Carvey opened "SNL" as Bush and noted that while the economy was sluggish he was not afraid to say the word "recession" repeating the word multiple times. Later in that sketch a Bush desperate to get the economy going turned his address into an infomercial hawking goods that he hoped Americans would buy from the "Salad Shooter" that quickly cuts lettuce to "the Hickory Farms' 'party in a box'...less than $20."Even at the White House Christmas party with Bush only a few feet away Carvey mocked Bush for vomiting in front of the prime minister of Japan.  But Bush laughed at all of jokes -- even though the entire crowd was arguably laughing at him.What a contrast to the painfully thin-skinned Trump who has not only lashed out at comedians who dare tell jokes about him but has even called for canceling "SNL" likely because he didn't like its jokes at his expense.  And in April Trump demanded that the White House Correspondents' Association end its 30-plus year practice of featuring a comedian because again Trump objected to the jokes directed at him. This past April Carvey appeared on Conan O'Brien's late-night show and reflected on getting to know Bush and his wife. "We had so many warm moments with them" he said adding it was "a different time. It wasn't scorched-earth angry politics." In response O'Brien said "In today's environment you do an impression of a president and you're the enemy."But you just can't dismiss the starkly different ways Bush and Trump respond to comedy as being a product of a "different time." I believe it has far more to do more with being a product of a different person. Bush told us that "politics does not have to be mean and ugly." In contrast "mean and ugly" sums up Trump. Just look at how a few months ago Trump ridiculed Bush and his famous "thousand points of light" phrase that was intended to encourage volunteerism. Overall there are many reasons to praise Bush -- as well as to be critical of some of his policies. But no one can deny that Bush could laugh at himself reminding us of a time when the occupant of the White House was not a petty insecure person. Hopefully the next president will not only be able to laugh at himself or herself but also share Bush's humanity and belief that politics doesn't have to be mean and ugly.,Opinion

(CNN)"When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation you're losing"  Sarah Sanders then a Donald Trump campaign aide famously said of Hillary Clinton supporters before the 2016 presidential election. Although she has repeatedly struggled with the facts -- and now serves as White House press secretary -- Sanders' apt tweet remains wisdom for the ages. Both President Donald Trump and Sanders have led the charge against special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors investigating the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia and other crimes unearthed in that endeavor. Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a "witch hunt" in an attempt to paint Mueller and his team as a band of corrupt authorities trying to bring down an innocent President. The closer Mueller gets the more caustic Trump becomes. On Thursday we saw yet another round of efforts to attack investigators after Michael Cohen the President's former lawyer and fixer pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's business dealings with Russia. While the President has maintained he had "nothing to do with Russia" Cohen told a federal court on Thursday that acting as Trump's representative he had been in communication with the Russian government about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow during the presidential campaign. Cohen previously told Congress that talks surrounding the project ended before the Iowa caucuses but they continued for at least six months longer. Faced with the new revelations made public by his lawyer-turned-nemesis Trump returned to familiar territory and lashed out against his accuser along with Mueller and the investigation as a whole. He called Cohen a weak liar while branding Mueller and his team of independent public servants "a total disgrace."To bolster his case Trump went on to amplify the words of various fire-breathing commentators on Fox News which has often served as a mouthpiece for the President during his ongoing attempt to discredit Mueller. Remarkably Sanders issued a statement on Friday suggesting Mueller's investigation "probably does undermine our relationship with Russia" while saying nothing about the Kremlin's documented efforts to interfere with America's sacred electoral process. Time is running out for Trump because the patience of the American people is not without limit. The public understands that elected leaders are not perfect but they will not accept a continued pattern of demonstrated deception. With Trump we have seen countless instances of his categorical denials completely subsumed by the facts.While Sanders denied in 2017 that Trump dictated a misleading statement to The New York Times regarding his son Donald Trump Jr.'s  2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians we now know Sanders' statement was false. We also know the President personally directed a $130000 payment to Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 election despite his complete denial of any knowledge of the matter.We have further learned that the President's full-throated claim that he had had no business ties with Russia was false (in an effort to rationalize his behavior the President himself tweeted on Friday that he "lightly" looked at a building project in Russia).As Trump's statements are continually found to be false and Mueller's progress is revealed in court documents many are beginning to see the light. The tired yarn that Trump sits at the center of an out of control "deep state" hellbent on bringing him down has now become quaint eliciting yawns and eye-rolls from the national security professionals I am frequently in contact with. The unyielding scrutiny on Trump's potential ties to Russia may feel like the work of circling sharks for those in the crosshairs of the Mueller investigation but many of us see a system working as it should to hold the powerful to account. In February I wrote that many people inside the FBI believe Trump was trying to undermine the institution for the sole purpose of discrediting Mueller's findings. It was true then and it remains true now. However what none of us could have predicted at the time is that Trump's repeated denials would be met with such a cascade of overwhelming evidence suggesting he has not been truthful with the American people.Fortunately for our institutions of justice each new exposed lie is further evidence that those in the Justice Department are not corrupt; they are simply doing their jobs and following the facts wherever they lead. If the Trump associates that Mueller has continued to knock down were indeed innocent the President might be spending his time presenting facts to prove the case rather than attacking Mueller and the investigation. And we all know that when you're attacking investigators you're losing. ,Opinion

(CNN)On November 11 2018 Jemel Roberson a 26-year-old security guard was shot and killed by a police officer responding to a shooting at Manny's Blue Room Bar in the predominantly black community of Robbins Illinois about 20 miles outside Chicago. Roberson was black while the veteran officer who opened fire -- identified only as a regional SWAT team leader -- is white.Earlier that evening a group of intoxicated men had been ejected from the bar according to local reports. When one of the men reportedly returned with a gun and opened fire Roberson managed to detain the shooter by putting his knee on the assailant's back one witness told WGN. Roberson who aspired to be a Chicago police officer was wearing a hat that said "security" according to an attorney for the Roberson family.The incident appeared to follow the NRA playbook. Roberson was a "good guy with a gun" taking on a "bad guy with a gun." As The American Conservative noted it sounded "like a Second Amendment success story." But then the police shot and killed the good guy.On Thanksgiving just 11 days later shots broke out during a fight between two young men at the Riverchase Galleria Mall in Hoover Alabama according to police. The suspect reportedly drew a weapon and shot an 18-year-old twice while a 12-year-old girl was struck by a stray bullet.Two uniformed Hoover police officers working security at the mall approached Emantic "EJ" Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. a 21-year-old black man who was initially described by the police as "brandishing a pistol." One of the officers shot and killed him. The Hoover Police Department initially declared Bradford the mall shooter but the department soon retracted this statement revealing that he was not in fact responsible. While the police narrative continued to shift in the days that followed the actual gunman remained at large until suspect Erron Martez Dequan Brown was arrested a week later.Many will conclude that these tragedies prove two seemingly obvious things.One: While the NRA asserts that a "good guy with a gun" can stop a "bad guy with a gun" these incidents reveal that in an active shooter situation police are all too likely to identify any armed civilian as the shooter.Two: African-Americans are more likely than white people to be killed by the police. According to an analysis in The Washington Post 51% of those killed by police in 2014 and 2015 were white while 28.1% were black. But white people made up 62% of entire country's population at the time while black people accounted for 17.9%.Active shooter situations are inherently urgent and confusing. While officers are trained to make split-second life-or-death decisions about the use of lethal force the natural impulse is nevertheless to treat any armed person as a threat. And that impulse is difficult to overcome. While it may be unclear whether racial bias played a role in the deaths of the two men in Illinois and Alabama there are just two certainties. Roberson the father of a nine-month-old baby with another on the way and Bradford a caregiver to his cancer-stricken father are tragically dead. Police officers routinely operate in situations of uncertainty. They are both sworn and trained to protect lives and civil rights. Often these two imperatives conflict. They are also trained to think before they shoot and to employ deadly force as a last resort. But in many cases there is no time to think and often the "last resort" is the only option that can save lives. No one ever said policing was easy. "Serving and protecting" in situations of uncertainty is in fact heartbreakingly difficult.As a former president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) I joined the current National President Vera Bumpers and Executive Director Dwayne Crawford in a meeting with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on November 28. Our purpose was to share with him and the Department of Justice our deep concerns over the halted progress in police reform and accountability especially after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo November 7 drastically reducing the DOJ's role in working to resolve disputes between communities and their police departments. Acting AG Whitaker listened to us and he agreed to continue the discussion in January to revisit the need for DOJ involvement in police reform and accountability.In view of the open-minded spirit of our meeting with Whitaker I am heartened and hopeful that the DOJ will act to restore the federal government's leadership role in helping police and communities to create a greater degree of certainty -- of truth justice and legitimacy -- especially in managing difficult policing issues such as the officer-involved shootings in Illinois and Alabama. These tragedies cry out for thorough and objective investigation leading to sound guidance from lessons learned.,Opinion
Dr. Azeem Ibrahim is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy and author of "The Rohingyas: Inside Myanmar's Hidden Genocide" (Hurst & Oxford University Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)The governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar's plans to start repatriating Rohingya refugees from the Cox's Bazar area ran into difficulty when not a single Rohingya volunteered to return.That's no surprise considering it was only a couple of weeks ago that Marzuki Darusman chair of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar described the situation inside Myanmar as "an ongoing genocide" against the Rohingya a Muslim minority in a Buddhist-majority country. The small proportion (less than 30%) of the Rohingya people left in Myanmar -- those who have not already fled over the border to Bangladesh since August 2017 -- continue to be subject to arbitrary violence by state authorities and non-state militant groups alike. And nothing regarding the legal and social environments which enabled the military's original "clearance operations" in the northwestern state of Rakhine have changed.The Burmese government denies claims that it has committed crimes against the Rohingya people. Authorities in Myanmar say they the clearance operations are targeting violent militants in the region.Nevertheless the ongoing humanitarian disaster is bad press for the Myanmar government. The government of Bangladesh is reeling from internal pressure over the refugee influx and is struggling to cope with the logistical social and financial aspects of the crisis. The ideal outcome of the Rohingya situation is for them to be able to return to their homes in Myanmar. The problem is that for the most part those homes no longer exist. They have been either burned to the ground or redistributed to Buddhist citizens. The repatriation plan is not for the Rohingya refugees to be returned to their homes: It is for them to be moved from refugee camps in Bangladesh to refugee camps in Myanmar.That would be catastrophic.International relief organizations and humanitarian observers have largely unfettered access to the camps in Bangladesh and can offer support both to the refugees. Most of these organizations however have been banned from Myanmar.  So the plan is to move the refugees from precarious but largely safe conditions to precarious conditions where they would be at the mercy of their previous attackers and out of sight from the international community or anyone who might want or be able to protect them.In the long run it may in principle be possible to allow for the Rohingya to return to Myanmar. But before that can be even contemplated Myanmar must change. The country must overhaul its 1982 Citizenship Law which rendered the Rohingya stateless. They must receive the same status and the same legal rights and protections as everyone else in the country. In addition the individuals inside Burmese institutions and civil society organizations who orchestrated this genocide must be fired and held accountable before international tribunals.But the highest priority must be given to ensuring the safety of the remaining Rohingya people. And realistically for the foreseeable future their safety can only be ensured by the international community -- who only have access to Bangladesh not Rakhine State.To that end the international community must work together with Bangladesh to invest in the refugee communities and in Bangladesh itself so the Rohingya and Bangladesh can together build a sustainable thriving community.And so far as it is possible the international community must seek to recover the costs of this endeavor from those who have instigated the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya from Myanmar: the Burmese government and the military leaders who incidentally also control most of Myanmar's wealth.,Opinion
Jill Dougherty is an American journalist a former CNN foreign affairs correspondent and Moscow bureau chief with expertise in Russia and the former Soviet Union. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)I first went to Russia in 1969 as an exchange student. I've studied lived worked and traveled there ever since. I'm now considered an "expert" on Russia a word which always strikes me as an exaggeration when it comes to understanding a country as complex as this.  I remember a friend of mine who studied Russian with me. He laughingly told me once that as he heard little Russian kids speaking the language better than he did that if he simply gave them a gentle kick they'd speak English.Sometimes I think our approach to Russia is like that. If only Putin his government or the whole country would come to their senses they'd see things our way. But like those kids who speak Russian because they are Russian Russia is not going to act as we do just because as we see it it's the "right" way.In mid-October in Sochi Russia I listened as Vladimir Putin answered questions at the Valdai Discussion group an annual meeting of international foreign policy experts. Sitting back in a large chair he deftly batted away his interviewer's probing and it became clear to me that as Putin sees it Russia never did sign onto "our" ideas -- Western principles and the "liberal international order." As the Soviet Union crumbled Russia was weak and went along with the West he said. But as it grew stronger economically and militarily it returned to its Russian roots.Now the United States and Russia are locked in an angry geo-political confrontation that threatens to spiral into direct military conflict - even if neither country wants it.America's current strategy toward Russia simply put is not working; it is instead tying our hands. It's making Russia more aggressive externally and less democratic internally. The dangers are escalating as this week's armed attack on Ukrainian military vessels in the Kerch Strait proves. Moscow is becoming bolder in challenging the United States and its allies while expanding its regional and global trade and security arrangements.We need to re-think how we deal with Russia. Confrontation combined with an endless cycle of sanctions isn't the answer even if sanctions sometimes are justified. But a "Let's just be friends" approach won't do either. For our own security we need a bi-partisan sustainable policy based on a realistic definition of why we even care about Russia.Like the United States Russia has its own strategic interests -- whether or not we accept them or condone them. For the sake of our own security we must try to understand what motivates Russia. Objectively analyzing Moscow's aims helps clarify how we should pursue our objectives or respond to future actions by the Kremlin. For that we need more tools than simply confrontation a more flexible strategy to respond to the dangers challenges and yes even opportunities that Russia may present. Although confrontation may sometimes be necessary we must add two more components: competition and cooperation.For the past six months I have been part of a group that's trying to outline such a strategy. It's called the Mayflower Group (after the DC hotel in which we've been meeting) and it includes political and public figures as well as policy analysts.Our first conclusion: To revise our strategy toward Russia we first have to define what is in America's own long-term strategic interests. The first interest is national security; Russia after all is the only country that can destroy our country with nuclear weapons.  And new weapons are on the way including hypersonic weapons designed to evade US defenses and hit their targets with little or no warning. Russia can disrupt our way of life even destroy our advanced weaponry through cyber attacks against US computer networks. And as we saw in 2016 it can exploit social media to undermine our democracy with disinformation campaigns. The US of course has the capability to harm Russia which locks the two countries in an embrace of mutual destruction.The Mayflower Group also concluded that we have to make clear to our fellow citizens that confrontation is not cost-free; If we let arms control agreements atrophy or even disappear are we willing to pay for an arms race?Also if we continue to sanction Russian individuals and entities can we still cooperate with Russia on space exploration and manage our competition in the Arctic Ocean? Are American business willing to lose out to foreign competitors on lucrative contracts with Russia?  If we don't communicate -- military-to-military political-to-political -- with the Russian government can we avoid misunderstandings that could have terrifying consequences?Our strategy we believe must:Strengthen strategic stability through verifiable arms control agreements and joint efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms.Bolster our offensive and defensive cyber warfare capability while also supporting dialogue with Russia and others designed to promote strategic stability in the cyber sphere.Restore official and citizen-to-citizen contacts to manage competition between our two countries and promote a better understanding of one another.Nearly a half-century ago studying at Leningrad State University the same university where Vladimir Putin studied law I lived in a dormitory with Russian students and made Russian friends -- some of whom I am still in touch with. It changed my view of Russia forever and gave me some insight on what motivates Putin and his country today.  Building a new US strategy toward Russia however is not an attempt to be "friends." It's not predicated on Russia's liking us. It is based on strengthening our own security.Like it or not building paths to Russia is part of ensuring US security.,Opinion
Myron Brilliant is executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The opinions expressed in this article are his own.For the better part of a year the United States and China have been engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war. It's time to stop. The meeting on Saturday between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit in Buenos Ares is the place to make that happen.To his credit President Trump is taking important steps to minimize security concerns arising from certain Chinese investment and technology acquisition practices. Now he must find a way forward that allows American businesses to participate in the world's fastest-growing economy with as much fairness openness and transparency as possible. The tariff actions have put pressure on a Chinese economy that was already under some stress. But tariffs have also served as a tax on American consumers and businesses and reciprocal tariffs from China are hurting American farmers ranchers and manufacturers. Saturday's meeting is the opportunity for the two presidents to abandon these damaging tariffs in favor of a framework for fair trade and investment.A truly successful meeting between President Trump and President Xi would result in three outcomes.1. China would announce near-term moves that would address long-standing areas of concern such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer or the practice of requiring that foreign companies share their technology to do business in China. For example China could issue a public statement recognizing that it will take immediate actions to quickly resolve a number of ongoing cases involving IP theft and discrimination affecting US companies. It could also establish permanent solutions that protect US intellectual property against theft forced transfer and infringement. These actions could stave off January's planned tariff increase.2. Presidents Trump and Xi should announce that senior officials will immediately open negotiations to develop a comprehensive enduring commercial agreement. In our view these negotiations should last less than six months and the two sides should aim to eliminate all tariffs within that timeframe. China must also commit to expanding market access for American companies. To advance fair competition in China and around the world China must also curb overcapacity in industries like steel solar and wind eliminate subsidies and remove restrictions on digital trade. These issues limit the competitiveness of US businesses in China while further distorting global markets and we're long overdue for change.      3. Both nations should commit to working jointly to preserve the rules-based architecture that has powered China's economic rise — from a developing economy to the world's second-largest economy. China will play a key role in the future of global trading. However China must recognize that the economic model it champions significantly diverges from the transparent fair market-oriented global norms that its leaders stated it would adopt upon joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.The United States is not alone in its view that China isn't playing fair. Our global allies agree that China undermines the fragile rules-based trading architecture and creates global economic distortions through its commercial policies and practices. China should move to adopt long-promised market-based reforms and re-commit to the promises it made upon joining the WTO in 2001. The outcomes we are seeking are tall orders and we are not naïve in believing that a single meeting at the G20 will solve the complex challenges facing China and the United States. But it's the right time and place to start.,Opinion
Moshe Kantor is president of the European Jewish Congress and the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation where he leads the struggle against anti-Semitism and racism and the promotion of tolerance and reconciliation human rights and interfaith dialogue. He also leads the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)The recent deadly attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh demonstrated more than ever that the threats from both the far right and the far left are rarely about individual Jews but against Jewish collectivity."The Jews" as in "All Jews must die" -- the phrase that the far right Pittsburgh shooting suspect Robert Bowers allegedly shouted as he shot at the worshippers in the Tree of Life Synagogue -- disregards the diversity of the Jewish people.  Whether religious cultural or political the only thing that mattered was that they belonged to the Jewish people. (Editor's note: Bowers has pleaded not guilty to 44 federal charges in connection with the attack.)On the far left many hold a paramount hatred against the Jewish collectivity and substitute the term Jews for Zionists meaning that the Jews do not constitute a people deserving of national sovereignty and self-determination in their ancestral and indigenous homeland.In recent years we have seen that this effortlessly shifts into ancient anti-Semitic motifs especially in Europe and singles out Jewish collectivity from all peoples on earth.When Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote "The Social Contract" in 1762 he created a new format for a relationship between the people and their rulers. This was the dawn of a new system of government. However the Jews were not to be part of this wave of equality and association.Later in 1789 speaking in a debate on the eligibility of Jews for citizenship the Count of Clermont-Tonnerre spelled out in a fateful sentence the terms in which Jews could be included in the new political exemption. "The Jews" he said "should be denied everything as a nation but granted everything as individuals."It was possible to allow individual Jews into the new social contract but not Jewish collectivity and it has been that way ever since.However after the Holocaust the greatest destruction and attempted annihilation of the Jewish people it was felt that a new social contract was being signed between the nations of the world and the Jewish nation.The return of Jewish sovereignty was welcomed and Jewish communities in more places than ever before in history were given full and equal rights.But now in 2018 this social contract between the nations of the world and Jewish collectivity is tearing apart at the seams. The Jewish state is being singled out among all nations for boycott divestment and sanctions viciously attacked in international forums and is the subject of age-old anti-Semitic myths like the blood libel and global control.In Jewish communities around the world Jews have to fight for their right to full understanding and equality. In France Belgium Scandinavia and now the US the Jews are constantly being targeted not for what they do believe in or think but because they belong to a certain community the Jewish community.In Europe due to rising radicalism populism a weak political center economic imbalances and terrorism -- combined with a lack of historical memory -- anti-Semitism is no longer considered an absolute evil. And it's likely to get worse.The ultimate goal is to change what has sadly become the new normal.Radicalization of the political spectrum continues with the severe weakening of mainstream parties which are expected to continue suffering major losses to the far right and far left.That is why we need to create a new social contract between the Jewish people and the nations of the world. We need governments to restate their obligations to all their citizens by ensuring equal right and protection by allocating funds and resources to ensure the security and well-being of the Jewish community.Jews have always been loyal to the nations where they resided and hold strongly onto the rabbinic dictum that "the law of the land is the law." We contribute to all walks of life whether medicine science technology arts and entertainment often disproportionately to our overall numbers. We do this as proud Jews and as loyal servants to our nations.We ask for nothing more than full equality and respect to be both a loyal and dependable citizen and an open and proud member of the Jewish collectivity. Our holy texts do not force us to decide between the two and inspire these feelings of loyalty to our rulers and governments.Nonetheless we are being asked to decide.On the far right they try to force us out of our countries; on the far left they try to force us out of our collectivity. We need governments around the world to speak openly and honestly against both these discriminatory efforts. Now is a time to speak against these trends and for our Jewish collectivity to be recognized and defended by those in leadership positions.This is why we reach out to the leaders of the world to repair this social contract before it is ripped to shreds before our eyes. Without this social contract our existence will become even more challenging anti-Semitism will increase and we will see more attacks like those in Pittsburgh Paris Brussels Copenhagen Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.,Opinion
Nic Robertson is CNN's international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author. Buenos AiresIf the G20 were a music festival you'd be stressing about not being there.The once snooze-worthy global power fest now looks like diplomacy on steroids.Where else -- even pay-per-view pales in comparison -- will you get so many heavyweights waiting to face off: Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump; Donald Trump and Xi Jinping; Donald Trump Justin Trudeau and Mexico to see if they can sign Trump's revamped NAFTA agreement to name just three. Trump who normally shuns international travel is turning the event into a one-stop diplomatic shop with seven bilateral meetings scheduled in 48 hours.Not yet on the agenda: a meeting between Trump and Theresa May but it will be worth watching the body language when they do cross paths. Just this week Trump publicly criticized her Brexit deal saying it makes the prospect of a trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom post-Brexit unlikely. If you are minnow even a big one like May Trump is a dangerous ally even on a good day. Just ask German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She's down for a one-on-one with Trump and it's hard to remember the last time he didn't try to undercut her just before they met.But this year's breakout star will be Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pretty much any leader he meets will be an event in itself.Did they smile? Did they shake hands? Did they broker any deals or sign any new ones? And did any of them give bin Salman a dressing down over the brutal killing two months ago of Jamal Khashoggi? And if not why not?The meetings are endless. Access sadly is harder come by than a Rolling Stones backstage pass. Even if you get one it will need to come with an accompanying unicorn so you can jump the tedious rings of security.Still this is the place to be.It's the type of weekend when rumors are legion and facts tantalizing. How big was Putin's grin? Did bin Salman get the cold shoulder -- and was he about to leave before it all began? Did Xi blink? And which leader most drew Trump's ire? Merkel and Trudeau know all about that.A lot of people will be hoping it's not Xi. In bad news for world trade both he and Trump seem set on course to escalate a trade war.Unlike Trump whose gut seems to guide him from hour to hour the Chinese leader is likely thinking a few years ahead. He is a leader for life and will be attending G20 summits long after Trump's time in charge is history.But that won't matter this weekend in Buenos Aires. The consequences of this meeting could cement a legacy that will put the condo salesman-turned-"very stable genius" President into the annals of 21st-century economic history. Then there is Putin who always seems to be able to conjure a fresh crisis as he lands on the world stage -- this time accused of shooting up Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.Trump has canceled his meeting with the worryingly provocative Putin. This means they won't get to discuss all of the crucial issues that John Bolton suggested they might from arms control to the Middle East. Putin grinned as he left his last meeting with Trump. Now he will have to leave the G20 unsure if the US will interfere in Ukraine as Russia tightens the screws on Kiev's sovereignty in the Azov Sea.Xi and Trump will be the next big-ticket meeting to watch. As I've mentioned there is a lot at stake. This is one on which world trade may swing or sag. Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Monday he is ready to impose tariffs on another $267 billion dollars of trade with China and indicated he is unlikely to not increase tariffs on another $200 billion of trade from 10% to 25% next year.His economic adviser tried on Tuesday to inject some optimism into the meeting saying there is a "good possibility" a deal can be made if "certain conditions" are met on "fairness and reciprocity" including on issues of intellectual property technology ownership issues and tariffs. But Xi has been staring down that same demand since trade talks began. Blink or fold it may be like watching paint dry but both men need to walk away winners if we are all to benefit.Trump's meeting with bin Salman is being downgraded. Not a full meet-and-greet according to Bolton although Sarah Sanders said she "won't rule out" some "interaction."It's still one to watch. The Saudi Crown Prince has already had some kind Trumpian blessing for his role whatever it may be in the Jamal Khashoggi affair in the form of a rambling White House statement last week that said he "may or may not" have ordered the journalist's killing.On Saudi minds will be the question: Will Trump find some way to embarrass bin Salman through his enthusiastic embrace?The expected meeting between bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will be unlikely to resolve once and for all how and why Khashoggi was killed -- and more importantly what happened to his body.If that were to happen there will be plenty more smiles in the obligatory so-called family photo which is usually a lackluster affair.Trump's various meetings will no doubt be focused on his America first policy especially on trade. This is likely to kill any chance of a substantial communique usually the big show at these summits.It's what stymied agreement a few weeks ago at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and last summer at the G7.Trump's abhorrence of multilateralism is taking its toll and creating global drama right out of "The Apprentice" playbook. Ratings for this G20 may well go up.Only a brave punter would put money on Theresa May surviving her Brexit turmoil at home and making it to the next G20 gig. Angela Merkel will too be wondering if this is her final rodeo. German politics are febrile right now and her steady step is faltering.See so much to keep your eyes on. Who's up who's down who's in who's out. So don't fall asleep; you might just miss the one they all end up talking about.,Opinion

Today she shares her story with school children across the UK as part of her work with the Holocaust Educational Trust. The opinions in this article belong to the author.  (CNN)The rise of the far right in Europe has brought back to the surface fears that many had hoped were gone forever.There is something chilling about the way in which some countries and politicians have treated people fleeing war and persecution.Emboldened by the justification that their racism and xenophobia is protected under the guise of free speech hatred is being allowed to flourish -- and it is not being challenged.As with any time of upheaval and political uncertainty when the far right rises Jews become an easy target.INTERACTIVE: A shadow over Europe Anti-Semitism has a way of changing over time. It mutates like no other hatred and is camouflaged in so many ways.It has evolved through the ages passing through the realms of religion and politics to where it lives today. It has permeated the minds of people throughout history.At first it was religious then social then it was racial and political. Whatever problems would arise it was always the Jews that were to blame.Whenever I go into schools to share my story I always ask the teacher whether they think the Holocaust could happen again.It sounds like a ridiculous question and yet more often than not the reply is "yes."READ: CNN poll results I am 88. I have been sharing my experiences for 30 years. I honestly believe that education is the only tool we have to challenge hatred and ignorance.We are approaching a seminal time. Not only is the entire face of European politics changing. But we are coming to a point where many survivors of the Holocaust are departing this Earth.I honestly believe that the only weapon we have left if we are to ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust are not forgotten is education.People have to be informed of what happened. They need to be educated. There can be no room for ignorance. After all once the survivors have passed what will be left?It has been a lifelong effort to recover from what happened at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen but I will keep telling my story.Unless we are prepared to act against hate then -- under the right toxic combination of circumstances -- anything can happen.ANALYSIS: Anti-Semitism is alive and kicking in Europe Has the world learned the lessons of the Holocaust? No I don't think so. Those ancient malicious ideas about Jews still persist.Many of these myths about Jews have existed for so long it will take decades maybe centuries for that to disappear.Tropes such as Jews having too much power in finance and the media are once again being repeated in mainstream politics and media. These same fallacies have been part of Western society for hundreds of years.For us to eradicate anti-Semitism it will take all of us who care all of us who want our children and everybody's children to live in a peaceful and safe society to stand up and unite against this ancient hatred.READ: World reacts to 'appalling' poll numbers For full coverage on CNN International please tune into Hala Gorani Tonight at 7pm GMT.,Opinion
Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)It is barely six months since the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was feted by the British press as a modern progressive fairy tale.But now certain corners of that same British press are turning against them -- or more specifically the bride.For the last few weeks the Duchess of Sussex has been the subject of hostile briefings by so-called "royal insiders" "courtiers" and "family friends" who portray her as a demanding bridezilla in the run-up to the wedding and a difficult boss who snaps at her staff.An assistant has left amid reports of barrages of emails and phone calls at 5 a.m. while Harry is reported to have loudly told courtiers before the wedding "What Meghan wants Meghan gets."We are told that the Queen was displeased about the bride-to-be's request for an emerald tiara and in the latest story that Meghan left her future sister-in-law Kate in tears at the fitting for Princess Charlotte's bridesmaid dress.Whatever the truth in any of these reports -- and there are always at least two sides to any story -- a troubling narrative is developing about the new Duchess of Sussex that seems designed to put her firmly in her place.There is an apparent effort to "other" her -- perhaps due to her being American but also in a more insidious way over her biracial heritage. After all how dare this successful independent-minded forthright woman have opinions on how she wants her wedding to be? How dare a woman who has worked hard at her career before she joined the royal family continue to send emails now she is on the inside?It has long been the case that young royals -- particularly those who marry into the family -- simply cannot win. Take a laid-back approach to royal life and you are accused of being lazy. But if you dare approach signing up to what must be an overwhelmingly rigid and traditional family firm with enthusiasm and gusto as Meghan apparently has you are attacked for being pushy and demanding.The Duchess of Sussex is not the first new royal to be criticized by the tabloid press for in their eyes not getting it right: Her husband's late mother Diana was both adored and pilloried by newspapers; her sister-in-law Sarah Duchess of York is to this day portrayed as apparently not quite fitting in.Before her engagement to Prince William Kate Middleton and her family were always too middle-class rather than aristocratic for those "courtiers" who briefed the newspapers.But for Meghan the othering has been stepped up a gear. The fact that she is an American and a Hollywood star added glamour to her wedding to Harry in May at St. George's Chapel in Windsor. Now her background is being used against her as if no one else in the royal family has ever been demanding or dared to express an opinion about a tiara.Even if there is a grain of truth in these stories let's step back for a moment. There are always tensions and stressful demands from a bride and groom in the run-up to any wedding. For a royal wedding to be watched by 2 billion people worldwide those tensions and stresses must be magnified by a thousand.For Meghan on top of all of this it was a period of intense personal turmoil as for those with short memories should remember her father was hounded by the media not exactly supported fully by Kensington Palace in the maelstrom and then announced he could not attend.She had to endure other family members selling their stories about her personal life while unable to speak publicly herself.So if Meghan did snap at Kate at Charlotte's dress fitting does she not deserve some understanding? And if as is reported Kate did indeed cry is this also not entirely unexpected given that she herself had very recently given birth? If Harry really did say "What Meghan wants Meghan gets" was it not simply an attempt by a loving husband-to-be for the wedding to go as smoothly as possible given all the turbulence? And is asking for an emerald tiara from the Queen an act of treason as some would have us believe or merely a request from a bride-to-be to put her own twist on tradition?It is possible these stories are gaining traction because there are rumored frustrations among royal journalists that the family -- and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's camp in particular -- are not giving anything away as they retreat to a more private existence in anticipation of the birth of their first child moving to a cottage on the Frogmore estate at Windsor away from the media glare of London.It is also notable that the negative briefings began shortly after Meghan and Harry broke the news of the pregnancy in October at the champagne reception of his cousin Princess Eugenie -- as if because the new couple had broken one unspoken social rule they surely must be guilty of breaking others.But judging by the crowds that turn up to Meghan's public engagements she remains one of the most popular members of the royal family. As she is unable to publicly hit back against anonymous hostile briefings against her our newest royal does not deserve the version of the fairy tale that's been written for her.,Opinion

(CNN)Every week I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States. Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing or PDB which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Donald Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.This week I offer a special briefing in advance of Trump's participation at the G20 summit in Argentina.If you give a mouse a cookieFrom Russian President Vladimir Putin's perspective the Michael Cohen bombshell exposing his lies about your alleged Russian business dealings could not have come at a better time. Putin probably thinks that you're entering the G20 worried about your exposure to the Special Counsel. He may even think he has leverage over you because he knows the truth about what may actually have happened between Russia and members of your campaign. Despite your denial of wrongdoing we assess that he thinks he knows all the dirty little secrets about who he worked with and when.   While he may have been itching for a repeat of your meeting in Helsinki -- it could have been a chance for him to score points at home when his domestic approval ratings are falling -- you citing Ukraine as the reason for canceling your meeting doesn't hold a lot of water. While you are canceling a meeting with him for violating Ukraine's sovereignty you went ahead with meeting him in Helsinki despite his violation of US sovereignty via election interference. Canceling (or postponing) the meeting is also signaling to Putin that you'll give him a relatively free pass on Ukraine. This is a diplomatic slap on the wrist for Putin. He knows that past presidents haven't viewed bilateral meetings as simple photo-ops -- but as opportunities to deliver tough messages. In a one-on-one meeting you could have delivered a clear message about the actual costs for his misbehavior -- including more sanctions and/or NATO enhancements.Even without a meeting expect Putin and his team to use their digital army and public statements to continue cooking up their favorite Russian recipe -- scapegoating imaginary political forces for everything Russia is actually doing wrong. He said that the recent clash with Ukraine was a political stunt by Ukrainian President Poreshenko.  And because he knows that your Twitter feed and public remarks are often filled with ire he'll likely rely on his favorite tactic of blaming US political forces rather than himself for any deterioration in the bilateral relationship.His goal is probably to divert your attention from punitive measures for his ongoing aggression and to refocus you on your usual suspects -- Democrats Robert Mueller and your perceived "unfair" treatment by other countries. But if you give Putin any wiggle room he'll just continue to push (with all kinds of force) for more.No points for just showing upG20 leaders may view your arrival in Argentina as a huge cost to the summit. Why? Because they fear a repeat of your previous summit performances -- such as when you insulted world leaders at a gathering of NATO or refused to sign the G7's communique in Ottawa.They also probably expect you to criticize what the G20 itself is premised on: multilateralism and the idea that coordinating with other major economies on international stability is of net benefit to each member.Your threats that the United States would leave multilateral institutions like the World Trade Organization and "go its own way" if NATO allies didn't pay up -- plus your withdrawal from multilateral efforts like the Iran deal Paris climate accord Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United Nations Human Rights Council -- have sent a clear message to your peers that you aren't a big fan of multilateralism unless it suits your agenda. They probably believe that it's your way or the highway particularly after you criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau the host of this year's G7 summit right after you left the summit.Because of this background foreign intelligence services might reasonably assess that you do not view the G20's focus on globalization and interconnectedness as an effective tool for international economic cooperation. They are expecting you to make unilateral statements about what America wants and what America needs -- rather than what's good for international stability. While much attention will be focused on your bilateral engagements a decision to insult the body of the G20 its host or its members could stoke more concerns about US isolationism.Making a murdererAfter you broke with our allies and issued a unilateral statement proclaiming that despite the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi the United States should continue doing business with Saudi Arabia your posture toward Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be the focus of much discussion at the G20. Any moves you make to embrace him further -- literally and figuratively -- will be perceived as emboldening him to murder again (even if MBS still denies any involvement). Any public display of affection you show for MBS -- even if he offers you a carrot like agreeing not to advocate further on oil production cuts -- may be interpreted as standing with Saudi Arabia and against our other allies like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (whom you are scheduled to see) and European countries who have pledged to cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia. However any coordinated measures you announce to punish Saudi Arabia -- even if not aimed at MBS himself -- could show a renewed interest in strengthening your (non-Saudi) alliances.You should be aware that statements you make in Argentina criticizing recent congressional moves against the Kingdom will be viewed as further evidence that your real enemies list is made up of whomever doesn't vote your way -- and not perpetrators of actual crimes.Not a one-trick ponyChinese President Xi Jinping probably knows that you have two goals in mind for your meeting with him this weekend: trying to maintain the image of your close personal relationship with him while concurrently hammering China to at least publicly profess (like they did after your first meeting last year) that they'll be more flexible on trade issues so that you can declare even a temporary victory. Xi has witnessed your tactics. He has seen you agree to a tariff cease-fire with the EU only to restart berating it again. And even if you agree to a US-China trade war moratorium temporarily he probably thinks that more tariffs are a foregone conclusion especially because of your team's recent findings of ongoing egregious Chinese behavior.While you highlight your leverage over China's economy we want to flag that the Chinese Communist Party is not a one-trick pony. Your (sometimes) friend  Xi is able to strike back with more than tariffs. Harassment of US businesses could increase along with harassment of US interests in the diplomatic and security space. China has ramped up its aggression against our ally Taiwan and with a more pro-China party winning last week's Taiwanese election China could increase efforts to hurt Taiwan's independence while concurrently upping its bullying tactics in the South China Sea and against US military assets.Xi also knows how much you have invested in denuclearization talks with Kim Jong Un and despite a lack of progress on that front there is reporting that he may be planning a visit to North Korea soon .While China has pledged to uphold relevant UN sanctions against Kim for now as North Korea's biggest trading partner Xi could choose to weaken enforcement of these sanctions if he feels like you're treating him unfairly on trade. If you're not playing by the rules it's safe to assume that neither will he. You should expect Xi to have coordinated with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in urging you to relax sanctions on North Korea. But this doesn't mean that China isn't considering covertly lifting the maximum pressure campaign for any number of reasons including their growing dissatisfaction with you.,Opinion
Mark Lynas is a writer on climate change and visiting fellow at the Alliance for Science at Cornell University. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)To get the best view of current progress to tackle global warming you need to climb a large volcano in Hawaii. In the rarefied air atop the solidified lavas of Mauna Loa more than 3000 meters above the hubbub of modern civilization sophisticated instruments hosted at the Mauna Loa Observatory take daily measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations.  Started in 1958 by Charles Keeling the long-term output of these measurements is a graceful curve which trends gradually upwards through recent decades. You can follow the Keeling Curve on Twitter -- earlier this year CO2 levels passed 410 parts per million higher than at any time since the Pliocene about three million years ago. The Keeling Curve is a reality check because it shows not the slightest downward blip despite increasingly intense international efforts to restrain greenhouse gas emissions. Remember the 1997 Kyoto Protocol? You won't see it on the Keeling Curve. Nor will you find any sign of the Copenhagen Accord of 2009 or even the much-heralded Paris Agreement of 2015. In other words -- despite all the noise and fanfare the sleepless nights and long days suffered by delegates at the annual UN Climate Change Conferences (the Conference of Parties or COPs) all the pledges on solar targets and coal peaking dates -- humanity hasn't yet done enough to make a tangible difference to the relentless accumulation of carbon dioxide in our planet's atmosphere. Addicted to fossil fuelsTo find out the reason for this lack of progress look no further than the International Energy Agency's annual reports. In 2000 the share of global primary energy supply coming from fossil fuels (coal oil and gas) was 80%. In 2006 it was 81%. And in 2017 it was... drumroll... 81% again. Read: World is woefully short of 2 degree goal for climate change according to UN reportYes renewables -- led by wind and solar -- have grown enormously in recent years. But so has the global economy and with it demand for energy to run our power stations transport industry and agriculture. In absolute terms clean energy can barely keep pace with growth so the proportion of fossil fuels remains unchanged.  The Paris Agreement included a paper commitment to aim to restrain the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. We've hit 1 degree already and unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut by half in the next 12 years -- an economic and political impossibility -- passing 1.5C is a virtual certainty. What about the other commitments that governments signed up to in Paris? According to the latest analysis by the Climate Action Tracker current government policies will lead to a global temperature increase of 3.4C in 2100 -- well above the committed target of 2C and certainly enough to cause catastrophic impacts that could threaten the entire future of human civilization. Read: To truly fight climate change we need to set our sights higherIn Paris governments volunteered to cut their emissions but add together these commitments and the resulting emissions path restrains the ultimate rise in global temperatures by a mere 0.2C yielding a rise of 3.2C by 2100. Anti-science denialism It gets worse. The current political surge in right-wing populism exemplified most by the election of President Trump -- who duly made a prime-time announcement that America would withdraw from the Paris Agreement -- endangers even the tiny progress that has so far been made. Many of these populist movements make anti-science denialism an article of faith with climate change action the most high-profile casualty. Australia's right-wing government has hinted it might follow Trump's example in ditching Paris while president elect Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has indicated he will redouble the destruction of the Amazon rainforest where the pace of deforestation has already increased.Read: Donald Trump buried a climate change report because 'I don't believe it'Where public pressure to enforce reductions in carbon emissions shows any sign of succeeding fossil fuels companies pour millions into efforts to squash it. For example BP pumped around $12 million into the successful effort to block a moderate carbon tax in Washington state. Overall fossil fuels companies outspend environmental groups by a margin of 10 to one. And the greens themselves have scored some notable own goals. Germany's push to eliminate nuclear power has led to a renewed dependence on coal and the bulldozing of ancient forests due to the resulting expansion of open-cast coal mining. Everywhere around the world that nuclear plants have been closed they have been replaced by fossil fuels worsening our climate emergency. Recognizing this the US environmental group the Union of Concerned Scientists recently broke ranks with the wider environmental movement in a new report calling for nuclear stations threatened with closure to remain open so as not to increase power sector carbon emissions. In Taiwan grassroots climate activists wearing polar bear masks won a referendum overturning the previous nuclear-exit policy.  The fight has barely begunIn the UK a new climate action group Extinction Rebellion burst onto the scene over the last month with daring actions causing chaos in the center of London. Their message came through loud and clear -- that if climate catastrophe is to be avoided we will have to do more than issue polite but unenforceable pledges at annual UN conferences. The COP is important but what happens out on the streets in the real world is more so. You can see a long distance from the top of that Hawaiian volcano and the figures don't lie: CO2 is building up irrevocably with each year of delay. Despite decades of COPs the fight to save the Earth's climate from collapse has still barely begun. The opinions in this article belong to the author.,Opinion

As it is being talked about increasingly widely I thought it might be time to revisit the three moments in American history when it ignited: during the presidencies of Andrew Johnson Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. What can we learn from those tumultuous examples?For my latest CNN special I sat down with some experts to understand what impeachment is how it works and whether President Donald Trump could or should be impeached.  Impeachment is a complex issue with political legal and historical dimensions. It's one of the most basic democratic safeguards enshrined in the Constitution yet few people really understand it.The first important thing to realize is that impeachment is a political process. An impeachable offense is at the end of the day whatever Congress defines as such. But in a constitutional republic shaped by law and history what is the mandate given to Congress? What does the Constitution mean when it speaks of impeaching a president who has committed "high crimes and misdemeanors"?In history's three main impeachment cases Congress "never defined high crimes and misdemeanors" explained Timothy Naftali a CNN presidential historian and a professor at NYU. Instead Congress cited "abuse of power or a certain violation of the law -- perjury or obstruction of justice." Why? "Because the Founders never defined high crimes and misdemeanors."Some backgroundThere is some legal background that is relevant or at least was relevant to the Founding Fathers when they wrote that phrase."That was language that they borrowed from the British" said Noah Feldman a professor at Harvard Law School. "'High' means pertaining to high office.... So if your crime or misdemeanor has nothing to do with your office you're not really covered by the Framers' idea of impeachment. But if it is connected then your act is high."Historically that appears to have been a common feature. Members of Congress who have voted for impeachment "always come back to the idea that some action or some pattern of conduct by the chief executive represents a threat to our democracy and to our Constitution" according to Naftali.The Founders' perspectives are valuable but they may have their limits. Most of them conceived of a presidency of extremely limited powers and they would almost certainly be stunned at the size and scope of the White House's power today. In their view Feldman notes the excessive use of presidential power -- taking the country into war without explicit Congressional authorization -- would likely have been much clearer grounds for impeachment than lying about sex with an intern.Impeachment talk seems to have become more common in recent years. After Clinton there have been cries to impeach George W. Bush Barack Obama and now Donald Trump.  This is part of a worrying pattern."It really has been about 20 years -- which is to say from the Clinton impeachment -- that impeachment talk has so overtaken our political discourse" noted Josh Matz co-author of "To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment."Bush and Obama "ended their presidencies with about a third of the country supporting their impeachment" Matz added but "President Trump came to office with about one third of the American public already supporting his impeachment. That's extraordinary.""This is a power that's meant to deal with a president who's gotten out of control not a president whose election you think was a terrible mistake.  But there was this drastic and rapid shift from electoral loser to impeacher-in-waiting."Impeachment and TrumpSo has Donald Trump committed offenses that could be considered impeachable? Laundering money through real estate deals? Defrauding Trump University students? Misusing his foundation or evading taxes? Of course such allegations have never been proven in a court of law.Feldman told me "Crimes that Trump may allegedly have committed before he had anything to do with the office of the presidency do not count as 'high crimes and misdemeanors' and they would not be impeachable offenses in my view."What about profiting off foreign governments while in office? Foreign countries have rented rooms and held events at Trump properties perhaps to curry favor with the president. That could land Trump in trouble because the Constitution prohibits federal officeholders from receiving "any present [or] emolument... from any king prince or foreign state."But Feldman advised against impeaching Trump over the Emoluments Clause. "I don't really think that we'd want to impeach the president where the impeachment would depend on the technical meaning of a word -- 'emolument' -- that has never been considered by the courts and it was used by the Framers 200 and something years ago" he said.Some people have accused Trump of obstructing justice by firing FBI Director James Comey. Could that lead to Trump's removal?"Obstruction of justice is a charge that was used both against Richard Nixon and against Bill Clinton" Feldman pointed out. "And if it's real it's a very strong ground for impeachment."Regarding Trump's case Feldman elaborated "It's true that the director of the FBI works for the president and the president has the right to remove him on any whim that he might have but the fact that the president can remove Comey doesn't mean that it's permissible for him to do it if he did it for gain." To prove that there would have to be a smoking gun and "It's very hard to prove corrupt intent" Feldman said.However Feldman does see possible charges in another case which he believes is "the closest parallel" to Nixon's case. (Recall that Nixon's scandal involved the break-in of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters by Republican operatives during the 1972 election.) According to the sworn testimony of Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen Trump directed Cohen to make an illegal payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in order to influence the election. "A president who distorts the electoral process and breaks the law in doing so is someone who is potentially impeachable" Feldman argued. "If there were evidence that Donald Trump further colluded with Russians in a way that undercut the legitimacy of the election that would be an even deeper parallel to the Richard Nixon case." These are of course the issues at the heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's enquiry and we will have to wait to see what evidence and conclusions his report contains.Experts disagree about whether this or that charge is impeachable but they do agree on one thing: the sword of impeachment must be wielded with great caution.Naftali called it "almost an unusable option.""Impeachment is capital punishment for a presidency and impeachment represents an undoing of the democratic process" he said. "You are overturning an election.... It's something that Congress should not consider unless all other avenues are no longer open."'A crisis of domestic governance'What would an impeachment process look like in today's deeply divided America?"A lot of folks think that impeachment is this mechanical process and that when the president commits high crimes and misdemeanors [it] just falls out of the sky like some kind of sword of Damocles" Matz said. "I'm here to tell you that it doesn't. Congress has to decide whether impeachment is the right move."Unless there is overwhelming proof accepted by the majority of the country impeachment will not bring the country together."It creates a crisis of domestic governance" Matz warned. "It activates the worst kinds of partisan tribalism on all sides of the aisle. In the eyes of some including some heavily armed parts of our population it may seem like an illegitimate effort to depose somebody who finally can speak for them."Feldman told me "The only circumstances where I would actively support impeachment would be where there was evidence so glaring that failure to impeach would essentially show the hypocrisy of the whole system -- would show that we're willing to allow a president who has committed visible crimes in connection to his office to stay in office."In other words America might be too polarized today to deal with an impeachment honestly and responsibly. That's a dark verdict on the state of our politics but it rings true. And it has a worrying consequence."When you live in a world of broken politics and when you live in a world of extraordinary partisan polarization it just may not be possible to generate the consensus necessary to use the impeachment power" Matz said. "That's a scary thought because the impeachment power does something important. There may be circumstances where we just can't wait for the next election and I don't have a reassuring answer to that."Matz invoked a famous line attributed to one of America's earliest sages: "Benjamin Franklin left the Constitutional Convention and he said when asked about what plan of government they had created 'A republic if you can keep it.'",Opinion

(CNN)The contrast could not be more stark. As big headlines around the world announced the death of George H.W. Bush on Friday just beneath them were these:  6 White House officials found in violation of the Hatch ActPence tweets deletes photo with sheriff's deputy in QAnon patchComey challenge to House subpoena goes to courtCohen thought Trump would pardon him. Then things changed.The juxtaposition highlighted the acute loss of the last World War II veteran to occupy the White House along with the decency and service Bush embodied. It is fitting that news sites' homepages Saturday morning were bracketed by Bush's death and the G20 summit in Argentina. They are in fact bookends. Bush heralded the New World Order and called for the transformation of international relations and economics once the United States and the Soviet Union were no longer pitted against each another in a contest between capitalism and communism. Bush knew the hope freedom and opportunity that the end of the Cold War would bring. But he also knew it presented dangers -- not least of all the disintegration of American resolve and unity. Without a common enemy would America and the Atlantic alliance remain united in the face of numerous global challenges? Would Democrats and Republicans?  America has relinquished much of its global leadership under President Trump who in many ways epitomizes a post-Cold War world. It is not a New World Order Bush could have imagined: a businessman and reality TV star who then became a president who touts "America first" while denouncing globalism.Trump is in many ways the opposite of the patrician and taciturn Bush. And that is one of the reasons our 45th president was elected. Bush was the ideal of the establishment. Trump is the rebel who undermines American institutions. He has also disparaged and denigrated the intelligence community Bush led as director of the CIA. Bush was not a perfect president or politician. He lacked Trump's ability to connect with voters emotionally. Most importantly many of his policies and politics planted the seeds of American division today. His successful but limited campaign against Saddam Hussein liberated Kuwait but left the Iraqi dictator in power arguably leading to the problematic second Gulf War. The resulting American occupation led many to doubt both the elite and foreign military engagements -- doubts that helped Trump win the election.The Willie Horton ad that Bush's campaign supporters used against 1988 Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis helped Bush win but it also exploited racist fears of black men. Bush's campaign manager Lee Atwater later apologized for it. Thirty years later Trump released a similar ad stoking fears about immigrants just days before the 2018 midterm elections.But Bush ultimately called on our unity far more often than he sought to exploit our divisions. Indeed he may have sacrificed his chance at a second term in 1992 by refusing to "go low" in his contest against young Democrat Bill Clinton whose campaign was at one point threatened by scandal. "He loved America with all of his heart and served her as fully and completely as anyone ever has" Condoleezza Rice wrote in her tribute to Bush. "He has finished his race with honor and dignity." Agree or disagree with Bush's politics it is his profound decency that is his legacy. Just one example: Read his letter to Clinton after he lost the 1992 election. That dignity and decorum is perhaps the greatest difference between Trump and his predecessors.That decency deficit is what has a led a handful of Republicans to repudiate Trump's politics and tone -- and many more did so before he was the party's nominee. But today's Republican Party is the party of Trump not the party of Bush.And America is at a crossroads. The suburban vote in the midterm elections suggested that many swing voters reject Trump's divisiveness. But do they accept the burdens of global leadership that George H.W. Bush embraced?,Opinion

Bush embodied a value that seems to be vanishing from our nation: public service. Love or hate his politics most politicians who worked with Bush valued his deep commitment to government. And few would challenge the argument that he devoted his entire life to the public arena. He was part of a generation in American politics when working for the government was a virtue not a vice.His career was remarkable. After serving in World War II and later making millions in the oil business Bush entered the rough world of politics in 1966 when Texas voters elected him to the US House of Representatives.  Five years later President Richard Nixon appointed him to be the Ambassador to the United Nations. He took over as the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973 a difficult time as Watergate was breaking. Nonetheless he proved effective and his career boomed. President Gerald Ford appointed Bush to be the ambassador to China and then in 1976 made him director of the CIA. But Bush was also interested in seeking higher office and ran in the Republican primaries in 1980 losing to Ronald Reagan but winning election as vice president. When Reagan finished his second term Bush defeated Massachusetts Michael Dukakis in 1988 to become President of the United States. He would not win reelection losing to Bill Clinton in 1992 but Bush remained active in the public eye teaming up with his predecessors -- including Clinton -- to raise money for disaster relief.  In politics Bush was not above going low.  During the 1988 campaign for instance he helped open the door to some of the nastier elements in our modern political world such as Lee Atwater's cut-throat campaign style that capitalized on division as a path to victory. But Bush also was not always successful at what he set out to do. He lost reelection in 1992 because he proved to have a tin ear toward the economic struggles of middle class Americans. The history books look back kindly on other aspects of his presidency. He took a huge political gamble by pushing a major deficit reduction bill in 1990 for example and he handled the collapse of the Soviet Union with the adroit skill necessary to ensure that US political leaders did not bungle the end of the Cold War. On domestic policy he repeatedly proved that he was willing to break with the most conservative elements of his party even as their clout increased on Capitol Hill. Despite the rightward drift of his party he gave his support to environmental and civil rights legislation. Newt Gingrich -- in 1990 the No. 2 Republican in the House -- never forgave Bush for agreeing to raise taxes that year though the deficit reduction package would become a major legacy of his administration. On foreign policy Bush demonstrated restraint as the hawks in his party were beating the drums for the US to maintain an aggressive stance. When President Bush did use force in Operation Desert Storm he insisted on pulling back US forces after the mission of freeing Kuwait was completed. But what is most striking about Bush's life beyond the policies or the politics was the fact that this man believed so firmly in the virtue of serving government. He was a civil servant to the core at a time that his own party was smashing government as inefficient and even corrupt. Reagan called government the problem not the solution yet his vice president made government his professional home. Bush believed in the power of political leaders to help usher the nation and the world through big changes. Not only was he a politician to the core but he was notably a father who raised two sons who served as governors -- with one going on to become President.We need more of George H. W. Bush's spirit in this country today. We live at a moment in history when the values that he represented seem to have been jettisoned with a President who often makes a mockery of the institutions he governs. On the sad occasion of Bush's death it is a good time to raise a toast to people such as him Republicans and Democrats who understand that what happens in Washington plays a massive role in the quality of our lives. ,Opinion

(CNN)In a world where each day's news sends us deeper into our tribes the passing of the ever-decent George H.W. Bush our nation's 41st President should cause us to reflect on a call for national political unity Bush made during his inaugural address: "To my friends and yes I do mean friends -- in the loyal opposition and yes I mean loyal -- I put out my hand... The American people await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. 'In crucial things unity' -- and this my friends is crucial" Bush said speaking directly to the opposition Democrats who controlled the US Congress at the time of his election.The last World War II veteran to serve as president President Bush's views on being loyal to your fellow Americans were likely forged while fighting alongside his brothers to save the world for freedom. They were all in one American tribe struggling -- side by side -- to save the world from absolute evil.His inaugural message seems quaint today as politicians operatives and commentators bludgeon each other and impute the worst possible motives to those on the other side. But failure to rise to Bush's admonition to be loyal to one another in our national affairs will continue to hollow America's soul. We are all in this together after all.President Bush was a partisan Republican and a man of strong convictions but he did not assume that those who disagreed with him where bad Americans. He fully understood the push and pull of American political debate and accepted the outcomes produced by our democratic processes.That acceptance was on display when he passed the torch to Bill Clinton after the 1992 campaign. The note he left in the Oval Office implored his successor to never let the critics discourage him and said "I am rooting hard for you." In today's politics it sometimes feels like we take greater pleasure in the failures and stumbles of our political opponents than we do in our own party's successes. Political campaigns produce winners and losers but the enduring example of President Bush's legacy is that America's political affairs cannot be a zero-sum game."In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home his neighborhood and town better than he found it" President Bush said in his inaugural address.George H.W. Bush certainly left the world better than he found it. He believed in an America where we root for and remain loyal to each other. He was of a generation that understood what could be accomplished when individuals and families sacrificed for the collective good.Rest in peace Mr. President. Your words and example of public service and civility remain a light for all Republicans and all Americans.,Opinion

(CNN)One day in 1982 when I was still a young intelligence analyst at the Department of State following Lebanon and the Palestinians the phone rang in my office. It was the White House situation room on the line.  Shortly after the operator told me to hold I heard George H.W. Bush who was the vice president to Ronald Reagan at the time say "Aaron I know you're busy but I read one of your memos on Lebanon. Do you have a few minutes to chat? I'm sorry to bother but I have a lot of questions."Bush's death Friday night should remind us all that the essential qualities in a president along with the inevitable flaws and imperfections are what define a presidency. And that day after hanging up the phone I was struck by a couple of them. First there was the sheer humility and decency of Bush's demeanor and attitude that morning.There was also his curiosity. Bush who won the presidential election in 1988 after eight years as vice president knew what he didn't know and he showed a strong desire and urgency to find out. The desire to learn what you don't know rather than basing decisions on what you already do is an essential quality of leadership. It also reflects the fact that you take the job seriously and shows a great responsibility to maintaining a high standard of professionalism and discipline. Those qualities can give a president both the confidence to act based on sound empirical evidence and a knowledge of when to hold back given uncertainties. Bush's decision not to invade Iraq after pushing Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait was one example of that mix of prudence and wisdom. Criticized by some as not finishing the job that restraint -- given the calamities that would embroil his son in Iraq in 2003 -- was clearly a critically important inflection point in the Bush presidency. There are many ways to assess Bush's presidency.  There are the superlatives of course. He was the first vice president to accede directly to the highest office since Martin Van Buren after Andrew Jackson and the first president since John Adams whose son would also become president. Bush also marked the last time a two-term president (in his case Ronald Reagan) passed on the office to a member of his own party. He was also the last US president to have served in combat. Bush along with his beloved wife Barbara who died in April this year also hold the record for longest marriage in presidential history: 73 years. There are the accomplishments which include navigating the end of the Cold War his support for Germany's reunification and signing the 1991 START agreement along with the passing of the American Disabilities Act and important amendments to the Clean Air Act. There were also of course setbacks and failures. Bush's nominee for Secretary of Defense John Tower was rejected marking the first time in in 30 years Congress would deny a president his Cabinet choice. Bush's presidency was also marred by the White House attack on Anita Hill during the confirmation of Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas.He ultimately lost the presidential election in 1992 and the brilliant military campaign that pushed Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait could not soften the harsh domestic realities of high unemployment rates and the public perception that he was out of touch with average Americans. But looking back now it seems that the real significance of the Bush presidency particularly against the background of the depressing demoralizing and demeaning aspects of today's politics was the matter of character. Sadly Bush now seems like a president of a bygone era as a man of deep experience selflessness and duty. While his mission in life was certainly driven by personal ambition it was always tethered to a broader goal of service and obligation to a nation he loved. Together with the passing of John McCain Bush's death reminds us of what's often missing in today's politics -- the service and bipartisanship required to lead a nation through difficult times.  In a moment of self-reflection at the end of the first year of his presidency Bush wrote in his diary "I'm certainly not seen as visionary. But I hope I'm seen as steady prudent and able." He was certainly that and more -- a president like so many of our best who instinctively knew that to lead was to put the well-being and security of the republic above his own.  We mourn Bush's passing with sadness and hope that his character commitment and basic decency will once again be reflected in the presidency he honored and valued so. ,Opinion

(CNN)A video is worth a thousand words: At the G20 summit in Buenos Aires Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can be seen flashing big smiles laughing and giving each other a robust high five before sitting down for their meeting. This bizarre image lit up social media. Reporters have been tweeting out jokes about what the two men must have saying. "You would be happy too if you just got away with murder" wrote Aaron Blake of The Washington Post as he offered his caption.But the video is also deadly serious. As these two leaders laugh it up -- and are in the process of thawing tensions between their nations by working in partnership to shore up crude oil prices -- there is a total absence of moral leadership from America's President. The video comes out as Americans are still recoiling from the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi and on the same day it was reported that the UK authorities believe Putin approved of poison attacks that killed a Briton and harmed a former Russian spy and his daughter. (Saudi officials have insisted that bin Salman had nothing to do with the murder and Putin's government has said the nerve agent attacks in the UK weren't its doing.)It gets directly to the heart of why President Donald Trump's family business might very well be legal but it's certainly not very cool. During the campaign some now wonder whether his bottom line influenced promises made to foreign leaders. When President Trump told reporters that "I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign" he confirmed some of the worst fears that are circulating in the public.  Despite the paper-thin firewall separating the President from his two sons who now control the business there are also deep concerns about what motivated his positions once he was President on Russia's intervention in the 2016 US election as well as the murder of a Washington Post journalist by Saudi officials allegedly connected to MBS and whether these stances have fundamentally undermined confidence in America's leadership role in the world. According to Gallup only 40% of Americans approve of how Trump has handled foreign affairs.It is almost impossible to know at this point why President Trump acts the way he does. While this is true of all presidents rarely have we seen a situation where there have been genuine fears that the administration is being driven by personal economic considerations rather than the public interest or even other sorts of interest group and partisan considerations. The reason Michael Cohen's admissions about the negotiations that were going on about the proposed Moscow Trump Tower project during the campaign which one associate said could have included an offer to give Putin a $50 million suite in the building is that they raise the big question of whether US policies have been influenced by the President's thirst for money. (Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani dismissed the idea that Trump was aware of discussion of a penthouse for Putin.) The President didn't make matters much better when he made a defiant claim to a gaggle of reporters that as a businessman he could do whatever he wanted during the campaign and had the right to look into possible business opportunities until the election was over. If Robert Mueller has been looking for a possible motive that explains the President leaning over backwards to placate Putin at key points in the presidency he might have found one.The same questions swirl around the President's position toward Saudi Arabia. While there are many legitimate reasons why the administration might seek to protect relations with Saudi Arabia and ignore a high-level murder such as the need for this ally in a turbulent region of the world it has not been lost on observers that Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner have real estate interests in New York that benefit from Saudi investment. The Saudis have also been loyal guests in Trump hotels.   The costs of the murky understanding that we have of Trump's business interests -- which stems from his refusal to release his tax returns during the campaign -- have been enormously damaging to our ability to evaluate foreign policy. The new revelations understandably generate concerns about the worst possible form of corruption namely that the President of the United States may have made big decisions about how to treat other countries based on his personal profit motive. It is as if Gilded Age corruption reached the global stage. If Americans were excited about having a businessman in the Oval Office they are now learning about the potential costs of this mentality when that entrepreneur refuses to change his outlook on priorities. Robert Mueller's final report will be important on a number of levels such as determining whether there are grounds for impeachment and providing a better understanding of what happened in the 2016 election. But restoring faith in the foreign policy process is as important as anything else. In certain respects we are fortunate that the nation has not yet faced a major immediate foreign policy crisis during Trump's presidency. If we did it would be hard for many citizens to have full confidence that the President was acting in the best interests of the nation. Mueller's report will be pivotal to clearing the air determining whether there is really nothing there to be concerned about or providing the kind of data that would be needed for House Democrats to start cleaning up the mess that the President has left behind. The short video that has made so many people cringe today draws its comedy from our fears and concerns. Why were the two men laughing? Where is President Trump when it comes to their behavior and what causes him to remain so silent?  If Trump had greater authority on the world stage and fewer questions looming about the ethics of his presidency he would be in much better position to stand firm against the most abhorrent behavior that we have seen -- even if still maintaining relations. Instead we just see them laughing.,Opinion

View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)A predictable and depressing ritual unfolds in January every two years. Members of Congress take their oath of office and then fail to hire senior staffers who reflect the diversity of the people back home they swore to represent. Those members will once they take office help pass legislation that shapes the nation. But how can they effectively represent all of their constituents if their most trusted advisers don't reflect a range of backgrounds at least as diverse as those whose interests they're serving?Now is the time to fix this problem. As the 116th Congress approaches members in the House and Senate will have hundreds of top- and mid-level openings to fill. Newly elected members will need to hire their entire office staffs and many House Democrats taking over as chairs of committees will need to double the size of their staffs. A serious commitment to diversity in hiring over the next four months can go a long way toward fixing the problem. Six new reports by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies give a better sense of the scope of the alarming lack of diversity at the top level in the Washington offices of six congressional delegations -- Delaware Maryland Mississippi Pennsylvania Tennessee and Virginia. These reports defined senior staff positions as chiefs of staff legislative directors communications directors and committee staff directors. These reports reflect data as of June 1 gathered using a professional research service associations and organizations for Congressional staffers of color social media posts and multiple queries to individual legislators' offices.By far the state with the worst diversity record of the six is Tennessee. While people of color make up around 25% of Tennessee's population they account for none of the state's 28 top staffers. This is even the case in the office of Rep. Steve Cohen -- who represents a district that is around 75% people of color.  It's worth noting that House Democrats and Republicans do not disclose data on overall staff diversity which makes it more difficult to assess diversity outside the most visible top positions. Senate Democrats already do disclose but Senate Republicans do not. Mississippi whose population has the largest share of black residents of all 50 states has a population that is over 40% non-white. Nevertheless people of color hold less than 20% of the top staff positions. And even though 13% of the 2016 Republican voters were African-Americans none of the 14 top staffers who work for the state's five Republican members are African-American.This problem is not limited to traditionally Republican states. People of color make up over 45% of the population of Maryland but none of the nine top staffers who work for powerful Democrats Sen. Ben Cardin Sen. Chris Van Hollen and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. The data also show a pattern of African-Americans disproportionately supporting Democrats but receiving a small share of top staff positions. For example our report points out that African-Americans accounted for over a third of the Democratic Party's voters in both Delaware and Virginia in 2016 but none of the 13 top staff positions in the offices of the four Democratic US senators from these two states. Unfortunately these four senators' offices highlight that this is more than a right-now issue; it's also a pipeline problem among mid-level staffers who might look to advance into top staff jobs. African-Americans make up a relatively small percentage of the mid-level staffers for Delaware Sens. Tom Carper (8.3%) and Chris Coons (6.3%) and Virginia Sens. Mark Warner (13%) and Tim Kaine (0%). All of these senators reported much higher percentages of staff of color to the Senate Democratic Diversity Initiative (Carper 46% Coons 21% Warner 38% and Kaine 40%). The low percentages of staff of color in top- and mid-level positions and the higher overall diversity numbers suggest that staffers of color are concentrated in lower-level or home office positions.  The lack of diversity in members' offices is not limited to these six state congressional delegations and it's a persistent trend. For example our September report on the entire US House showed Latinos and Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders held none of the 64 top staff spots on committees or in leadership offices. Our 2015 report exposed minimal top staff diversity in the Senate.  Some congressional leaders are at least aware of the problem. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi recently wrote a letter to her House colleagues emphasizing the importance of staff diversity in the 116th Congress. She flagged some key reforms such as creating a House Diversity Office and interviewing at least one person of color for each open position (the "Rooney Rule"). The letter was a good first step.More however is needed. Both the entire House and Senate should disclose staff demographic data every year. Each member's office should go further developing a written diversity plan and requiring staff to undergo unconscious bias training.Much has been written and rightly so about how transformative and diverse this incoming Congress will be -- a Congress of "firsts." That reality coupled with the required turnover and flurry of hiring that accompanies any new Congress means the next weeks and months are a critical time to act to promote staffing diversity as well. Rather than letting this opportunity pass Congress should use this window to diversify its offices and do more to finally give all Americans a voice.,Opinion
Elie Honig a former federal and state prosecutor is a CNN legal analyst and a Rutgers University scholar. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)President Donald Trump lashed out on Thursday at his former personal attorney Michael Cohen after Cohen's guilty plea to a new criminal charge in the Southern District of New York. While Trump might want to practice his poker face a bit when facing adversity it is easy to see why he is so visibly flustered.Cohen's guilty plea cements the Trump Organization's financial ties to the Russian state deep into crucial phases of the 2016 election cycle.  And even beyond what we learned Thursday Cohen promises to deliver more damning information about Trump and his campaign to special counsel Robert Mueller in the weeks ahead.    We now know that Cohen is cooperating with Mueller. While the document to which Cohen pled guilty in August (called an "Information" which is essentially an indictment that both parties agree to) was signed by attorneys from the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney's Office today's document is signed by Robert S. Mueller III himself.That suggests two important things. First while the subject matter of Cohen's August plea -- bank fraud tax fraud and campaign finance fraud -- arguably fell in the margins of Mueller's mandate to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election this plea is right down the middle of the Trump-Russia relationship.  Second Mueller apparently has now confirmed to his satisfaction that Cohen is being truthful and that his information can be corroborated by external evidence. On Wednesday Trump stated of Mueller's investigative practices that "this flipping stuff is terrible" and that prosecutors use tactics from the "Joseph McCarthy era" and routinely pressure witnesses to lie.This is flatly untrue. I worked as a prosecutor for 14 years and I know firsthand that prosecutors are if anything obsessed with ensuring that cooperators tell the truth whether it helps or hurts a potential target. This is why prosecutors focus so intently on corroboration independent evidence that confirms the cooperator's testimony.   For an example of this vetting process in action look no further than Paul Manafort who flamed out as a cooperator earlier this week.  Prosecutors on Monday informed a federal judge that Manafort had lied to them.  For Mueller and for any good prosecutor that is a deal-breaker. Mueller consequently rejected Manafort as a witness -- even though Manafort likely could have offered a rare look into the Trump campaign's inner sanctum -- because Manafort lied during the cooperation process.Cohen now has gotten through that vetting process apparently to Mueller's satisfaction.     Trump like a typical boss recognizes the threat posed by cooperation and rails angrily against it.Before he boarded Air Force One on Thursday Trump took a few swipes at Cohen calling Cohen "very weak" and accusing Cohen of "lying."This is Cooperator Bashing 101 -- standard textbook stuff from a frightened target of a criminal probe. As Trump seems to understand cooperating witnesses often pose the gravest threat to the leaders of closed corrupt hierarchical organizations. When I was working as a prosecutor I typically built organized crime cases by working with cooperating lower-level players against mid-level players and then with mid-level players against bosses.  Trump is also demonstrably wrong and Cohen is provably correct about the timing of the Trump Organization's efforts to build a lucrative new property in Moscow (what the Information calls the "Moscow Project").  Cohen pled guilty Thursday to lying to Congress when he testified that the proposed Moscow Project ended in January 2016. Evidence cited in the Information shows the discussion of getting the deal approved carried on into June 2016 --  after Trump had become the presumptive Republican nominee. Trump appears to claim that Cohen is lying when he says that the deal carried into June 2016. Yet the Information quotes documents -- presumably texts or e-mails -- from May and June 2016 in which Trump Organization members give instructions to Cohen about the then-still-ongoing "Moscow Project."The proof is right in those documents in black and white: Cohen may have misled Congress before about the timing of the Moscow project but he is not lying now.   Trump also argued Thursday that the Moscow deal never happened so what does it matter?  It matters because while he was trying to open the new properties in Moscow Trump's proposal "would require approvals within the Russian government."  Whether the Moscow project succeeded or not Trump needed to curry favor with the Russian government to get the necessary approvals to move it forward.    That incentive to curry favor with the Russian state raises several key questions. Did the late-breaking change to the Republican platform in 2016 taking a softened position on Russia have anything to do with the Trump Organization's effort to obtain approvals from the Russian state for the Moscow Project?  Did Trump's hiring of Manafort as campaign chair for no salary have anything to do with Manafort's deep ties to pro-Vladimir Putin Russian oligarchs? Is there any connection between the Trump Organization's business dealings with Russia and the Russian state's effort to hack the e-mails of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee among others?All of this may just be a warmup for what lies ahead. Now that Cohen is cooperating Mueller likely knows everything that Cohen knows. Mueller therefore can use Cohen's information to probe Trump's involvement in any number of things including potential campaign finance violations arising from hush money payments made to Stephanie Clifford and Karen McDougal -- which Cohen himself pled guilty to in August directly implicating Trump.   Federal cooperation is all-or-nothing. The cooperator does not get to choose what information he gives to prosecutors or who he cooperates against. Everything is fair game. So if Cohen knows it then Mueller should know it now too. That should cause Trump some restless nights ahead.

Rebecca A. Kobrin is the Russell and Bettina Knapp Associate Professor of American Jewish history at Columbia University. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)On Monday a Twitter debate erupted between Democratic Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Lindsey Graham over what lessons should be learned from the Holocaust. Ocasio-Cortez contended that the point of remembering the Holocaust was to apply its lessons to contemporary events like the events at the southwest border of the United States while Graham argued that reckoning with it meant seeing it as utterly distinct. In one tweet Senator Graham wrote: "I recommend she [Ocasio-Cortez] take a tour of the Holocaust Museum in DC. Might help her better understand the differences between the Holocaust and the caravan in Tijuana."While the question divided two of Washington's most outspoken figures the deeper problem is that their discussion failed to make clear an entirely different connection between the two historical moments: the role the United States and its immigration policies played in the unfolding tragedy of the late 1930s. By failing to pass legislation that would have allowed more Jewish refugees to settle within its borders the United States inadvertently sent a message to the rest of the world that Jews were expendable. This week is a particularly apt time to reflect on the legacy of US immigration policy in the 1930s. Eighty years ago this week on December 2 1938 the first group of Jewish refugee children arrived in Great Britain as part of a larger humanitarian effort to save Jewish children from the growing violence of the Nazi regime.  Known as the Kindertransport (children's transport) the initiative allowed Jewish children under the age of 17 from Nazi-occupied Germany Austria and Czechoslovakia to settle in England without their parents or guardians because Winston Churchill convinced Parliament that it had to use immigration policy and not just foreign and military policy to stand up to Hitler. Escalating violence against Jews in Nazi-occupied territories like Kristallnacht weeks before had made them refugees. Eventually between 9000 and 10000 children settled in England through this program.Americans should study this period because at the same moment that England opened its doors to children under the age of 17 our own government failed abysmally to respond to the Nazi menace -- largely because of the bigotry and xenophobia that shaped visions of Jews and the State Department's immigration and refugee system. In February 1939 Senator Robert Wagner of New York and Representative Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts sponsored a bill based on Kindertransport program. Wagner and Rogers wanted Congress to temporarily admit 20000 Jewish children until it was safe for them to return home. As the bill stipulated their stay would not have cost taxpayers a penny; various Jewish groups had agreed to assume financial responsibility for the children.  But the bill failed to move out of committee because of racist fears that cast Jews as dangerous to the nation. As Laura Delano Houghteling wife of the US Commissioner of Immigration and cousin to FDR allegedly summed it up at a dinner party: "Twenty thousand charming children would all too soon grow up into 20000 ugly adults."The current presidential administration's policies seem designed to echo Houghteling's sentiment: placing child migrants in the past months in "tent city" jails separating them from their parents or tear-gassing child asylum seekers at our border.  As a professor of American Jewish history and Jewish migration I have thoughts about what Americans should consider as their representatives debate the lessons of the Holocaust. Let's start with thinking about how immigrants are being talked about today. The asylum-seekers at our southern border have been called "invaders" and "terrorists." As reporters embedded in the group have shown these men women and children are not terrorists; most of them see themselves as fleeing for their lives.  The continued demonization of this group has not only been in language but in action as well: by sending troops to the border and using tear gas this administration portrays this as a group to be feared. As the Auschwitz Memorial Musuem aptly tweeted earlier in the week "It's important to remember that the Holocaust actually did not start with gas chambers...hatred gradually developed from words stereotypes & prejudice through legal exclusion dehumanization & escalating violence."  Let's continue with better education. Americans today as numerous surveys attest lack basic knowledge of the Holocaust. Nearly half cannot name a single concentration camp. But as the gap in Graham and Ocasio-Cortez's Twitter debate highlights Holocaust literacy can't be only about what took place in Europe. Americans should read histories and original sources like newspapers and government documents that illustrate how many in the US believed Jews were inferior or suspect in the 1930s -- and how that perception contributed to immigration and refugee policies that kept many Jews trapped in Europe. Indeed even after American soldiers saw what had taken place in Buchenwald Dachau and Auschwitz the United States still refused to accept most survivors of the concentration camps. Truman penned an executive order in 1945 in response to the opposition he saw in Congress to providing refuge for people who had survived the Holocaust.  The lesson of the 1930s that Churchill understood so clearly and channeled into the Kindertransport is that immigration policy is an expression of a nation' values. Governments make choices that impact lives. While the question of immigration reform is complex America's immigration policy over the last two years has conveyed a lack of regard for the basic human rights of asylum seekers and a total cruelty towards the special needs of children.  Some policymakers like Lord Alf Dubs recognize the deep connection between the lessons of the Holocaust and the shaping of contemporary immigration policy. Dubs himself brought to the United Kingdom on the Kindertransport became the author of the "Dubs amendment" passed in May 2016 requiring the UK government to act "as soon as possible" to relocate and support unaccompanied refugee children in Europe. While the implementation of that measure has been far from perfect Americans can and should take a lesson from Dubs that children of asylum seekers contribute to their new homes and can even become some of their greatest leaders.Americans including any members of Congress thinking of engaging in a Twitter debate should remember England's act of humanitarianism and the 10000 lives it saved. England acted boldly through both immigration policy and foreign policy as the US government failed to act. England probably did not go far enough; more could have been saved and the children of the Kindertransport who were saved had to endure because of the trauma of family separation for the rest of their lives. But at least England appreciated that children seeking asylum deserved refuge and not to be tear-gassed for seeking shelter across its borders. By failing to make policy that looks more like the Kindertransport and less like "a wall" the United States may be turning away some of its future leaders. ,Opinion
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)What kind of America do you want? It may be the most important question facing voters Tuesday. Penn Jillette has an idea: "All I want out of America now is kindness" wrote the magician and author. "The past few years have filled too many of our friends and neighbors with hate and it breaks my heart... So many of us now agree with the message of hate and play 'ideology' as team sports" he lamented.  "Anyone whose tone is kind will get my complete support." And how about you Ai-Jen Poo? An America that honors families said the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance who is a child of Taiwanese immigrants. With cruel immigration policies "the people who control our government have put a series of moral choices before us. How do we really value family and the well-being of children -- all families and children?"An America that protects "rights protections equality and justice" wrote Alyssa Milano. "Voting is how we prove that our country is so much kinder and bigger and better than that man in the White House."But political scientist Carol Swain warned against sweeping into office "a leftist's counterfeit remake of our nation" especially after "President Trump has quietly checked off the accomplishments he promised to the American people" including a booming economy.Time for a reality check wrote LZ Granderson: "That restlessness in the pit of your stomach isn't there because the sky is falling" since Trump. "It's there because social media has pushed the clouds away the sun is shining and you're made uneasy by the clarity of who we really are and what we've always been."The fear campaignAs the hugely consequential midterm election loomed the word of the week was fear. The nation was horrified in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.  But as families were burying their dead-- and reckoning with the specter of murderous American anti-Semitism--President Trump Fox News and the far-right fanned conspiracy theories about race and immigration into the overheated election cycle. They invoked their all-purpose Jewish bogeyman the investor and philanthropist George Soros. Naturally wrote Kate Maltby: white supremacists see Jews Hispanics black people and Middle Easterners as the Other threatening their status.  The President needs to do more than condemn the individual actions of racist killers. "He needs to repudiate the conspiracy theories that fuel their bloodlust." Nicole Hemmer wrote that we might have seen Pittsburgh coming. In last year's violence in Charlottesville "the anti-Semitism part of the story quickly disappeared. Most analysis centered on Confederate statues and anti-black racism...a core part of the story." But "lost sight of the specific history behind the Nazi flags that flapped beside them." And then on Thursday the President tweeted an incendiary video about a murderous undocumented immigrant."Racism is a helluva drug" wrote law professor Dorothy Brown. She noted Justice Department stats that show whites had more to fear from one another when it comes to crime. But "facts don't matter now; Trump has a midterm to win." And John Blake marveled at an American leader whose bigotry is losing its ability to shock: "President Donald Trump may be on the verge on doing something that arguably no American leader has ever done. Make racism boring."  Whitey Bulger taken down by a wannabe?The homicidal Boston mobster Whitey Bulger 89 was beaten to death on Tuesday--a day after he was transferred to a federal prison in Bruceton Mills West Virginia. One suspect the Boston Globe first reported is a Massachusetts mafia hitman Fotios Geas known as Freddy. "In 2011 I tried and convicted Geas along with his brother Ty Geas and their mafia boss Arthur 'Artie' Nigro for a string of vicious murders" wrote Elie Honig a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor.  Geas tried to make his name in the mob by showing he was a cold-blooded killer. He did it—and wound up in a prison with Whitey Bulger.  But let's let Honig tell the remarkable story... The "caravan" may just be a minivan All week the President bounced around the country trying to fend off a "blue wave" and whipping up fears over the dwindling group of migrants from Central America most of them children who are in southern Mexico and walking this way—an "invasion" Trump said.   But that's a fallacy wrapped in a fiction argued David Gergen and James Piltch.  We should take a lesson from Mexico. "Since 2010 the flow of undocumented Mexican immigrants has decreased significantly."  That's partly because life in Mexico improved they wrote and we should try to help Central America do the same -- "create better and safer opportunities for the citizens of these countries. We should not cut aid; we should increase it." Alice Driver traveling with the migrants and pausing in Juchitán Mexico lamented how "Trump has tried to erode" faith in America as a "refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty." "A hungry tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet" is not something to fear. But Rich Lowry in the National Review said Trump may be distorting the caravan as a menace for midterm advantage but he "gets the big point right: We have borders and should enforce them."  Fox's Lou Dobbs problem?Hours after a gunman shot dead 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue wrote Jen Psaki Fox re-aired a segment of Lou Dobbs' show in which Chris Farrell from the conservative group Judicial Watch said the "Soros occupied State Department" funded the migrant caravan.  Fox Business later condemned the remarks.  Democracy is suffering from the "partnership between a serial liar now occupying the oval office and a major news network that has evolved from the voice of the conservative movement to a forum for racist and divisive conspiracy rants" she says.   It's already baked in the cake explained New Day host Alisyn Camerota who worked at Fox before coming to CNN.  In a 2016 meeting with candidate Trump he congratulated her on the move but complained that now she was "being mean" to him.  "I tried to explain the role of the free press ... It didn't work" she wrote.     Is Iowa over Congressman Steve King?   The white-culture warrior from Iowa has held office since 2002. Voters should ditch him wrote Jacy Gomez a former staffer for GOP Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. King recently endorsed Toronto's nationalist candidate for mayor who has said "white genocide" threatens Canada.  King's nativism is "a blemish on an otherwise admirable state...his hate-spew has real world consequences" says Gomez. Health is on the ballotLouisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy a medical doctor complained about Democrats trying to paint the GOP as the enemy of pre-existing-condition coverage.  Not true he says: Democrats are trying to rewrite history. They want to "set the stage for a single-payer health care system" and Medicare for all.    Citing a drop in Americans' life expectancy Georges C. Benjamin executive director of the American Public Health Association counseled voters to ask candidates questions about prevention; the best leaders "address the root of the problem." That means funding public health programs research on gun violence and the health fallout from climate change opioids and more.  "Ask what the long-term effect would be on your community if parents can't earn enough to pay the rent and women can't plan a family on their terms."  Maybe the Democrats are delusional?Conor Friedersdorf a political independent confided in the LA Times that he usually votes "candidate" not "party."  Not this time -- he's voting Democratic. "The reason is simple: President Trump." Voters must decide whether the President "will continue to enjoy the endless support of a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans or confront a Democratic House that checks his power." But Democrats expecting a rout in reaction to Trump may be delusional argued Jason L. Riley in the Wall Street Journal. "Economic growth has accelerated unemployment is low salaries are increasing and consumer confidence is strong."   Two years in "who's afraid of Donald Trump?"It's in the Constitution Earlier this week Trump announced that he would upend the Constitution's 14th amendment and halt birthright citizenship by executive order—sometime.  It's "a desperate midterm election Hail Mary" aimed at anti-immigration voters wrote John Avlon;  ironic to boot "given the conservative movement's obsession with Obama-era executive orders." It won't hold up in court he says.  "I'm a birthright citizen" declared Naaz Modan who rooted in the New Jersey suburbs in the 1980s. "My story and the story of many other first-generation citizens is the American story"—immigrants signing on to "a set of shared ideals—democracy rights liberty opportunity and equality."  She concludes: "It comes as no surprise that a man who called himself a nationalist just one week ago is now undermining these values."Let's pause on that wrote Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony: Trump gets the nationalism vs. globalism issue—"the great political struggle of our age"--exactly right.  Before Hitler gave nationalism a bad name "national independence and self-determination" were seen as "key to a free world... free institutions limited government and personal liberties."   Ntozake Shange's pioneering voice We lost Ntozake Shange poet and author of "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf" at 70.   Jane Carr wrote: "generations of women of color -- and others who felt marginalized traumatized or held locked in place by an unforgiving world -- found themselves in Shange's choreopoem."  Tweeted actor Kerry Washington "So grateful for her vision and voice." ,Opinion
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)Less than 24 hours after authorities arrested a man accused of terrorizing the nation with mail bombs another man shouting anti-Semitic slurs and armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday killing 11 people and injuring six.  The suspect Robert D. Bowers 46 was captured at the synagogue.President Donald Trump called the attack "pure evil" and said "our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief." Then he headed to Illinois for a campaign rally 10 days before the midterm elections. ("I don't want to change our life for somebody that is sick and evil.").The trail of anti-Semitism and other hate speech on the suspect's social-media accounts was a familiar marker of domestic terror wrote Jay Parini. "Racism gathers into its dark embrace haters of every kind. Their victims can be of any minority group -- Jew Muslim Latino black gay." For a country "awash in guns hate erupting into murderous violence is a chronic condition."  And while the President is no anti-Semite his "rhetoric has fueled and empowered racists of every stripe...Americans: wake up please! Remember why we exist at all: we were founded by immigrants fleeing persecution abroad..." Writing in the Washington Post Jennifer Rubin warned of the mainstreaming of right-wing "blood and soil" nationalism in the United States and Europe. The shooter may be responsible for this act of mass murder she wrote but politicians who "celebrate 'nationalism' or declare the United States is a 'Christian nation'... are consciously or unconsciously channeling and amplifying anti-Semitism." Twin terrorsThe slaughter at the Tree of Life Synagogue followed days of anxiety and furious debate over who might have been responsible for sending package bombs to a range of people -- mainly prominent Democrats. On Friday the apparent answer came. Cesar Sayoc a 56-year-old Florida man with a long criminal history was arrested in Plantation Florida and his van plastered with right-wing slogans and pro-Trump stickers was hauled away. President Trump had been complaining on Twitter earlier in the day that "this 'Bomb' stuff" was slowing down Republican momentum in the midterms. He instantly pivoted to condemning "these terrorizing acts" before cameras at the White House praising the speedy work of law enforcement. That was teleprompter Trump talking suggested Paul Waldman in the Washington Post and it didn't last long: "after reading some perfunctory remarks about unity he played the victim saying 'Who gets attacked more than me?'" -- before returning to campaign talking points like his plans to halt the migrant caravan moving through Mexico when it reaches the US border. Wrong threat wrote Julian Zelizer.  "The caravan Americans should be worried about is already here. It is the white van that the alleged attempted mail bomber Cesar Sayoc was driving."  The President errs in focusing on "allegedly dangerous people who are part of the movement of immigrants seeking safety within our borders" when "a real concern for the country should be the potential for violent domestic political extremism to flare among people who live here and who perceive themselves to have an ally in the White House." Indeed despite a brief telepromptered condemnation Wednesday the President had downplayed the steady stream of pipe-bomb packages that had sown terror from New York to southern Florida while some of his supporters pushed the idea that the bombs were a "false flag" sent by liberals to discredit the right. "On his radio show Rush Limbaugh asserted Republicans just don't do this kind of thing" wrote Peter Bergen. "That is simply false ... there is in fact a long history of political violence emanating from the far right."    The suspect's motivation is yet to be spelled out but there was no denying what the targets had in common wrote John Avlon. "They've all been targeted by President Donald Trump and made into bogeymen for the far-right often on Fox News by opinion anchors like Sean Hannity" with astonishing frequency. Since he became President "Trump has attacked CNN 63 times on Twitter ... tweeted attacks on (Hillary) Clinton 109 times ... mentioned (Rep. Maxine Waters) 73 times in speeches press statements and tweets since March of this year" including to call her a "low IQ individual."  Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat urged "reasonable elements within the GOP (to) take a second look at the real-life consequences of the hate speech that has overtaken their party. On this issue breaking with Trump would truly be a civic duty and one that might save American lives and democracy in the future." Hold on wrote David French in the conservative National Review before the arrest of Sayoc: "it's worth repeating that we don't have any evidence at all that Trump's words matter to the bomber. Yet for some regardless of the evidence (that) emerges in the next several days Trump's responsibility will remain an unfalsifiable belief." It will take "moral courage to follow that evidence wherever it takes us -- even to the darkest places in our own political movements."  And former FBI agent Josh Campbell cautioned that "this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is much larger than partisan politics. This is a serious life-and-death matter of public safety." '"I'm sorry" just doesn't cut it' Megyn KellyIn a panel discussion about Halloween costumes on Tuesday the NBC host Megyn Kelly wondered aloud why blackface would be a bad choice for white people.  "What is racist?" she asked posing one of the most ill-advised rhetorical questions ever. The next day there were reports that she was likely toast at NBC. Kelly apologized.  Too late wrote Roxanne Jones. The former Fox host "fell into the trap ensnaring a lot of undercover bigots in America today. ... They think they can redefine the meaning of racism by arguing that they don't believe in being PC -- which to me means that they want to be free to deny the humanity and equality of others who are not like them." By Friday NBC had dropped Kelly's morning show. But Kelly didn't get a fair shake at NBC wrote Joe Concha in The Hill.  She "never seemed particularly welcome nor given a true chance to succeed." In the end NBC chair Andy Lack "threw Kelly under the bus when things got inconvenient." Course correction? Historian Tim Naftali noted that national polls show that the GOP "now the Trump Party does not represent the desires of a majority of Americans" on the key issues of the day: health care women's rights climate change and immigration. On paper at least November 6 should bring "a major course correction in American politics." But if instead the "outcome of the struggle in the current three-person race among center-left anger Trumpist rage and widespread apathy" is a victorious Trump he warns then "our political system will face its strongest stress test in the modern era." A video that popped up on social media Monday roiled the tight Georgia governor's race. It showed Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams participating in the burning of the state flag at college in 1992. Don't be fooled Jill Filipovic said. The video was "aimed squarely and transparently at riling up a racist base" -- by defending a racist flag. This flag was not "some storied part of Georgia's history" but was adopted in 1956 in response to desegregation. Its Confederate symbol was "a big deliberate and clear middle finger to African-Americans."   Chris Pine shows his all in a Hollywood movie The actor's private parts make a cameo in "Outlaw King" an upcoming Netflix movie about a 14th-century Scottish ruler. To Twitter and the media this is a big deal (or at least no small thing) because as everyone knows women appear frontally nude in movies regularly and men hardly ever. It's a disturbing double standard wrote Holly Thomas but that's not really the point. The outsized furor over "his stripping off ought to be read as a symptom of injustice for all genders in the movie industry" she observed.  Better still "the democratization of nudity on-screen would be hugely advanced by moves toward equality off-screen" -- more women on and off camera and more respect "for all actors who take their clothes off in the line of duty."  Lottery billionaire watch outThe frenzy over the largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot -- $1.537 billion -- ended with the drawing Tuesday of the winning ticket bought in Simpsonville South Carolina. But by week's end no one had claimed the prize. Just as well wrote Kate Maltby: "bear in mind the number of lottery winners who've met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread." There was the guy who won $30 million in Florida in 2006 and was found "buried under a concrete slab" (his girlfriend wanted to manage his winnings herself); and the Powerball winner who blamed his sudden wealth for the drug deaths of his daughter and granddaughter ("I wish that we tore the ticket up").  Says Maltby: "Count your lucky stars and pray that you don't win."  Khashoggi's death awakens a lethargic worldNearly a month ago Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul shook the world out of its "outrage lethargy when it comes to human rights violations" observed author Gayle Lemmon. "What was it about this one horrific tragedy against a blood-soaked collection of so many others that made it stand out?" Lemmon asked. "The world's most vulnerable children face sexual abuse in a refugee camp and barely a reaction is received. Thousands of Yazidis -- among them mothers and children -- remain missing and those who have returned have only tents to call home. But the world has moved on; no one seems to feel they can do much of anything to make a difference for much of anyone."  Sandra Day O'Connor's brave goodbye The first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced that she is in the early stages of dementia. "After a life of service to justice to women and to those caring for and living with Alzheimer's we owe her our thanks and well wishes for the long goodbye" wrote Jay Newton Small who lost her own father to dementia. O'Connor had stepped down from the court in 2006 to care for her husband who suffering from Alzheimer's forgot her and took up with another woman in his senior community.  "The decision to be public with such a private episode" to raise awareness and confront stigmas about the disease "was very much in line with O'Connor's quiet activism all her life."    ,Opinion
 (CNN)The midterm elections a little more than a month away are a national drama -- with voters deciding whether Republican control of the House and Senate will give way to Democrats who have been hankering for a chance to challenge the priorities and actions of President Donald Trump. But they are also an intensely local story as voters get ready to make their choices in 435 House and 35 Senate races and in 36 gubernatorial contests. We asked commentators to tell us which race they are watching most closely and why. The views expressed are solely their own.Is Ted Cruz Beto-able?The crowds and the media love him. But will Texas voters turn out for Beto O'Rourke?  In November the faceoff to watch will be between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke. This contest could upend the political order in the Lone Star State. And an August NBC News poll showed O'Rourke within 4 points of Cruz.    This race is fascinating because it is the Democrats' best chance in years to turn Texas blue. Democrats have long looked to the state's changing demographics -- Texas is about 40% Hispanic -- with hopes of putting the state into play. However Texas' electorate is not the same as its demographics. In 2016 despite a slight increase from prior elections less than half of the state's eligible Latino voters turned out at the polls. Ironically this race is between one of the country's most prominent Hispanic politicians (Cruz) who supports Trump's wall and admittedly doesn't speak Spanish well and a white upstart (O'Rourke) who is against the wall and fluent en Español. O'Rourke's rise is remarkable considering that he is running as a staunch liberal. He supports gun control the legalization of marijuana and universal health care coverage. What began as a grassroots effort has now garnered such momentum that even Cruz's former campaign spokesman thinks  O'Rourke could pull off an upset victory. O'Rourke comes across as authentic and youthful which is reportedly making Cruz nervous. Still it will take more than viral videos and friendly appearances on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" to put O'Rourke over the top. He remains David to Cruz's Goliath. While O'Rourke's likability factor is huge his effort will hinge on voter mobilization. To win he will have to perform strongly with millennials Latinos and voters in Texas' more liberal cities. In interviews O'Rourke has often asserted that Texas is not a red state it is a nonvoting state. He's got that right -- and so his success will depend on upending this paradigm. Raul A.

Will Arizona elect its first Democratic senator since 1988?With the House expected to fall to Democrats and Republicans expected to keep and possibly even make gains in the Senate sweeping 2020 projections will be tricky to make after these midterms. But I'm watching the Senate race in Arizona with a few things in mind.First putting aside the historic promise of Arizona electing its first woman to the Senate it's possible Arizona is about to elect its first Democrat since 1988. President Donald Trump only won Arizona in 2016 by a little over 3 percentage points -- if Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema pulls out a win over Republican Rep. Martha McSally it will be hard not to see the significance of a reliably red state voting blue.Second if that happens exit polling will be key. Was Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and child separation policy a factor? That specifically will have national implications and might serve as a forecast of his 2020 re-election hurdles among Hispanic voters.Finally if McSally an Air Force veteran wins the significance won't be that a Republican kept the seat red. It will be the kind of Republican who did it. McSally easily beat out Trumpian Kelli Ward in a race that was supposed to send a message to perceived "moderates" like McSally the outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake and even the late Sen. John McCain that their kind has fallen out of favor among conservatives. McSally's win here will prove there's at least some desire for less "Trumpy" Republicans even in a historical red state.  SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and host of "SE Cupp Unfiltered." Mother of a slain young man runs for CongressThe electoral race that most encapsulates the potential of this political moment and the future of politics in our nation is Lucy McBath's contest to unseat Republican incumbent Karen Handel in Georgia's 6th Congressional District just north of Atlanta.Unlike Handel the former secretary of state of Georgia who has taken strong stances against Obamacare and regulations McBath is not a career politician interested in dismantling Washington legislation. She's not even a lifelong activist. She was by her own account just a regular "suburban mom" until her son Jordan Davis was shot and killed outside a gas station in Florida in 2012 in a dispute over playing loud music. Davis is black and the white man who killed him had a conceal carry permit. In that horrific moment McBath became as she told me over the phone recently "a mother on a mission."Speaking out about her son's death and the need for comprehensive solutions to gun violence and systemic racism McBath joined "Mothers of the Movement" women whose black children have been killed by gun violence or the police. McBath also became a national spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. "Then Parkland happened" McBath explained to me. "Those children were the same age as Jordan when he was murdered." She thought maybe now finally policies would change. But when they didn't McBath took the next big step -- and declared her candidacy for office. McBath represents the moment we are in as a country today -- where more and more people are not only protesting and lobbying against status quo injustices but also transforming their anger into real political power.  "This is our modern day civil rights movement" says McBath.  Yet while progressive movements for change haven't always embraced electoral politics or have been slow to do so the recent surge of multi-issue multiracial progressive protest has quickly focused the movement on political change. Mitt Romney won GA-06 in 2012 by 23 points. But Trump just barely won the district in 2016 by one point. And when Handel won the special election a year ago over Democrat Jon Ossoff the race was still quite close. So McBath has a real shot at victory. But either way she's blazing the trail for ordinary people to become engaged in the political process including running for office. "I intend to win" says McBath "but no matter what happens this is a win-win."Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book "The Opposite of Hate." Will an anti-Trump liberal Democrat win in rural Kentucky?This race in Kentucky's Bluegrass region features a well-funded incumbent Republican Andy Barr running against an outsider Democrat Amy McGrath who easily beat two establishment politicians in her primary. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET and votes are counted quickly in Fayette County (Lexington) the district's largest which means we'll know early whether Barr weathered the stormA Democrat win likely means a big night for their party. The Cook Report rates the district R+9 and Trump won here by more than 15 points. If Democrats are knocking down contested jump shots like this it means the "blue wave" is real.McGrath a former fighter pilot leans on her military credentials to fend off the usual attacks that sink Democrats in Kentucky. Shortly after the May primary internal polling from both parties showed her with a decent lead. But Barr's campaign smartly went on offense in August dropping brutal attack ads featuring audio of McGrath claiming: "I am further left I am more progressive than anyone in the state of Kentucky" a bold statement given Kentucky's only Democratic congressman John Yarmuth is one of the most liberal in Congress.McGrath has been taped at numerous fundraisers staking out liberal positions on abortion and taxes stances better left to campaigns in California than Kentucky. Republicans believe their barrage will have conservative Democrats reaching for the ejection handle on McGrath's bid.  Both parties are all in with donations and outside spending piling up. Can an anti-Trump liberal Democrat win in rural Kentucky? You'll know before dessert on election night.Scott Jennings a CNN contributor is a former special assistant to President George W.

Will the Tennessee Senate race be a referendum on Trump?Keep a close eye on Tennessee where Republican Marsha Blackburn is facing off against Democrat Phil Bredesen a former governor. This race will be a good lens through which to see what kind of damage if any President Donald Trump might be inflicting on the GOP. The state is now in comfortable Republican territory. The GOP has a supermajority in the state House controls seven congressional seats and now holds onto both Senate seats. However a majority of the nation does not approve of how Trump is doing his job with his approval rate hovering in high 30s and low 40s. So how will Trump's tenure impact this partisan dynamic?The Tennessee Senate race to replace Bob Corker pits the popular two-term governor against a Trumpian Republican who elicits the strong support of anti-abortion activists. While Bredesen promises to expand health care access and opposes the Republican tax cuts Blackburn has been a harsh critic of the Affordable Care Act and voted in favor of recent tax cuts.And though Bredesen is an unusually popular Democrat and leading in the latest CNN poll his victory would signal a big chip in the partisan armor of the GOP which would inevitably be blamed on Trump's impact on his own party.While one part of the story in November will revolve around who wins control of Congress another big issue that political observers are watching is whether Trump with his unstable behavior and radical approach to governance will stimulate any sort of backlash within his own party that goes beyond words of reprimand. It would take major midterm losses including defeats that cut deep into Republican territory to push congressional Republicans into actually taking a stand against the President and beginning a soul-searching process. If this Tennessee Senate seat goes blue that would be the kind of outcome that could have a real-world impact on Capitol Hill.Julian Zelizer is a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University editor of "The Presidency of Barack Obama: A First Historical Assessment" and co-host of the "Politics & Polls" podcast. Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizerA Democratic veteran aims to win in Trump countryThere are so many remarkable women and men running for office this year -- Rashida Tlaib Beto O'Rourke Ilhan Omar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- but out of all of them West Virginia's Richard Ojeda might be the one most worth watching. Ojeda voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now he's the Democratic candidate for his state's 3rd Congressional District. Trump not surprisingly is not his biggest fan -- calling him a "total whacko" at a recent rally in West Virginia.It's a wide-open race: Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins vacated his seat leaving Ojeda to compete against state Rep. Carol Miller. In a district that went for Trump by 50 points Ojeda is polling at 40% to Miller's 48%. And 12% are undecided. If you're wondering why he's got a shot just give him a listen. Ojeda is an emboldened outraged veteran who came back from battle to find his home embattled. While many Americans risked their lives in nations abroad many more struggled in our own nation -- persistent income inequality a disappearing middle class -- and even died as a pernicious opioid epidemic for years went ignored. Yet his opponent doesn't seem to prioritize these issues. Instead Miller makes it clear she endorses Trump -- and that the President endorsed her. She appears concerned with defending the Second Amendment cutting taxes and lining up behind the agenda of the commander-in-chief who Ojeda regrets voting for. Meanwhile Ojeda speaks the story of struggling Americans in a dialect that dyes progressive populism with the hues of a very red state. This explains why in addition to his support for more affordable education comprehensive immigration reform and the decriminalization of medical marijuana he vocally supports West Virginia's coal industry even as he acknowledges the reality of climate change and strives to keep his state competitive through investment in clean and alternative energy sources. Such politics explodes the myth of insurmountable and immutable partisanship. Good for America. But helpful to me too as I find myself increasingly unable to singularly identify as a progressive or a conservative. Ojeda suggests that we don't have to be only and forever Democrats and Republicans that we can grow and mature. And we don't have to be milquetoast centrists. We could refuse the political boundaries imposed on us for what are boundaries but limits and who are Americans except people who refuse to believe anything is impossible?Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy. He is the author of the new book "How to be a Muslim." Will Georgia elect first black female governor?There's a dead heat in Georgia and I'm not talking about the weather. The race for governor of Georgia could not be closer. Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are deadlocked. The latest Real Clear Politics polls shows Kemp at 45% versus Abrams at 45%. In other words Republicans in this center-right red state realize they are in a real fight.It's not hard to see the headwinds on the national level are blowing through the Peach State. The proverbial soccer moms of suburban Atlanta are conflicted with the tone and tenor of President Donald Trump. But there is time for a course correction before Election Day.After all the two candidates could not be more different. Secretary of State Kemp is campaigning on "Putting Georgians First" with a focus on jobs public safety and education. Former State House Minority Leader Abrams -- who could be the first female black governor in the country -- has fully embraced the progressive agenda. Kemp seeks to expand gun rights while Abrams supports gun-control measures. Kemp wants quality affordable private health care for all while Abrams wants to expand Medicaid. Kemp support anti-abortion measures while Abrams wants to protect abortion rights.   Though Abrams is charismatic as a native of Atlanta myself I can say her positions are too extreme for the state. Georgia remains a center-right state. Kemp is a center-right candidate running a center-right campaign. As long as he continues to focus on what's going right with the economy Georgians will come home to the GOP.Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz for President.Familiar third-party candidate challenges status quoThose who aren't on board with President Donald Trump's agenda but just can't bring themselves to support the Democrats have a sliver of hope in New Mexico where former Gov. Gary Johnson a libertarian has entered a three-way race for a US Senate seat.As the Libertarian Party's candidate for president in the 2016 election Johnson earned 3% of the vote  the best finish for a national third-party candidate in 20 years. Still the outcome was something of a disappointment for Johnson who had hoped to capitalize on historic levels of dissatisfaction with the two main party candidates but instead became a punchline after a series of gaffes. (Remember "what is Aleppo?") Afterward he swore he was done with politics.But now Johnson is mounting an unlikely but far from impossible challenge to incumbent Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. A former Republican governor of the typically blue state Johnson is still popular in New Mexico: A recent poll showed Heinrich leading the race at 39% with 21% for Johnson and 11% for Republican Mike Rich. Some 30% are still undecided.Johnson is an economic conservative known for vetoing hundreds of bills during his first term in office. But he's also a social liberal who supports abortion rights immigration and drug legalization. And he's no fan of the President; in fact he said Trump's election "could be the end of the republic as we know it." A good showing for Johnson would be a win for the Libertarian Party while also proving that centrist liberals independents and Never Trump Republicans can find a compromise candidate.Robby Soave writes for the libertarian magazine Reason. Follow him on Twitter @robbysoaveCan a Republican win again in a Clinton district?On November 6 my eyes will be glued to the returns coming in from Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Three features of the race that pits Republican incumbent Will Hurd against Democratic newcomer Gina Ortiz Jones make it especially important. First it's one of the 23 House districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 but that sent a Republican to Congress. Both parties are laser-focused because it's prime real estate to flip. If the Democrats don't win this district it's hard to imagine a path to majority control in the House of Representatives.Second Gina Ortiz Jones has the candidate profile that seems to be motivating Democratic turnout across the county. She's young. She's gay. She's a woman of color. She's an Iraq War veteran. And she's progressive. If Jones can't turn out the vote then that bodes poorly for Democratic candidates with less compelling personal stories.Third Hurd isn't a Donald Trump acolyte. He differs from the President on DACA and the border wall (not surprising given that the district is 55% Hispanic). And as a former CIA official he has condemned the administration for how it handled Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Hurd poses a challenge for Jones in a way that not all Republicans in similar swing districts do. In short if TX-23 goes blue then it's likely that the wave is nothing short of a tsunami.Jennifer L. Lawless is the Commonwealth Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia.Is Maryland ready for a civil rights leader turned governor?I have known Ben Jealous the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor for 2½ decades. What strikes me most about him: Every week month and year that I have known him he has been passionately working to help people who needed a strong champion. He is known as the youngest ever president of the NAACP a venerable ailing civil rights organization that he fixed and turned around. But he has not helped only African-Americans.Though Jealous is running against Republican candidate Larry Hogan who has tried to distance himself from Trump Jealous' campaign like many this November is about President Donald Trump. And Jealous is everything that Trump is not. Where Trump seeks to divide and cater to a narrow base Jealous has spent his life building diverse coalitions for change in the public and private sector winning major victories for DREAMers the LGBTQ community and abolishing Maryland's death penalty. In the private sector he is an investor who has helped over 20 socially conscious companies launch and grow creating jobs and proving that you don't have to sell your soul to do well in business. He connects as easily with blue-collar white guys as he does with black female churchgoers.Electing a civil rights leader and businessman right on Trump's doorstep would send a huge signal that voters across the country are turning out to resist bigotry division and corrupt government.You don't have to guess what Jealous would do in office. He has been winning real victories for underdogs in every role he has ever played.Van Jones is the host of the #VanJonesShow and a CNN political commentator.

There was a nasty Democratic primary fight that the national party actively engaged in with a ham-handed release of opposition research on the progressive candidate Laura Moser. Ultimately they got what they wanted in Lizzie Fletcher a more moderate nominee who Democratic leadership believes will have a better chance of knocking off a longtime incumbent.And Fletcher is still a young fresh female candidate with a great resume and strong ties to the district. The first test will be whether Democrats coalesce around her candidacy to support her on Election Day like they have in other elections when the more progressive candidate was defeated such as Virginia's governor race last year.Culberson has been in office for almost two decades and he has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act repeatedly an issue that has become the No. 1 topic for Democrats running this fall. If that message works in the Texas suburbs it will be a good sign of its effectiveness in other swing districts.Finally the race also has the potential to benefit from the huge enthusiasm Democratic Senate nominee Beto O'Rourke is generating at the top of the ticket.  Even if he falls short of knocking off sitting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz his impact on the turnout could send Fletcher as well as a handful of other new Democratic members from the deep red state of Texas to Congress.Jen Psaki a CNN political commentator was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration.

Follow her at @jrpsaki.We're in for another Florida nailbiterIt has been 24 long years since Florida voters elected a Democratic governor. But all signs point to a possible history-making victory by the party's nominee Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.The race offers an early test of whether swing states like Florida support President Donald Trump's performance. Gillum a progressive favors single-payer health care and has called for an increase in corporate taxes and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.His Republican rival Ron DeSantis is a fervent Trump supporter riding an endorsement by the President to victory in the Republican primary. While Trump's backing was enough to win over GOP voters the November general election is another matter. Trump carried Florida in 2016 by only 113000 votes a margin of 1.2% of the more than 9 million votes cast.That means the state is up for grabs this year giving Democrats a chance to end their exile from the statehouse.Florida is a true swing state a fact etched in the nation's memory in 2000 when a razor-thin 537-vote margin delivered the state and the presidency to Republican George W. Bush.Since that infamous squeaker the state has seesawed in presidential races supporting Bush again in 2004 then switching to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before flipping back to the GOP by supporting Donald Trump in 2016.Democrats know that winning the state this year would give the party a head start on trying to carry the state in the 2020 presidential election.Errol Louis is the host of "Inside City Hall" a nightly political show on NY1 a New York all-news channel. Will New Jersey elect its first Republican senator since 1972? The last time Republicans won a Senate race in New Jersey Richard Nixon was president. Over the last 46 years Republicans have found spectacular ways to lose New Jersey Senate races even when the GOP found success in wave election years nationally. They even lost when Ronald Reagan won a landslide re-election victory in 1984. Although New Jersey has been a traditional Democratic stronghold with Democrats outnumbering Republicans by nearly 900000 voters have elected Republican governors over the years. Yet the Senate has eluded the GOP since 1972.Opposite the national trend of Democrats running competitively in Republican leaning districts across the country the New Jersey Senate race may actually be in play in a reliably blue state.  GOP Senate candidate Bob Hugin a wealthy former pharmaceutical executive and former Marine has spent nearly $16 million of his own money attacking incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez as corrupt after his federal corruption trial ended in a mistrial and his severe admonishment by the Senate Ethics Committee. The attacks seem to be working. According to the latest Stockton University poll Menendez's once double digit lead is down to 2 points 45% to 43%. While other Republican candidates across the country pledge their loyalty to President Donald Trump Hugin is taking another approach by declaring himself a "different kind of Republican." He's pro-abortion rights against tariffs and critical of the GOP tax plan that hurt many of the state's property owners because of the cap on state and local tax deductions. All these positions are at odds with the President who unsurprisingly has a low approval rating within the state.New Jersey's Senate race is probably too close for comfort for Democrats who already have to defend 26 Senate seats 10 in states Trump won in 2016.  With a slim 51-49 GOP margin of control every Senate race counts in 2018 -- even in New Jersey.Tara Setmayer a CNN political commentator is the host of the "Honestly Speaking with Tara"  podcast.

Will's Faso's racist Hail Mary pass throw him a lifeline?Every race is critical: Here in California where I live now there are seven key House seats in districts that went blue in November 2016 and any path for Democrats to flip Congress will run through those. But the race I'm tracking most closely is actually in New York my home state albeit in the suburban reaches of upstate surrounding Albany: The dead-heat contest between vulnerable Republican incumbent Rep. John Faso and his Democratic challenger Antonio Delgado. Delgado is an incredibly impressive candidate -- a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar who is running as a moderate progressive. He's also black running in a district that's 84% white. Faso in contrast is a Trump-down-the-line checkbox in the House; until recently he's been best known for voting to kill Obamacare despite vowing to a cancer-patient constituent that he would not compromise her insurance in a video that subsequently went viral. But Faso has a new infamy attached to his name: Pressured by polls showing that Delgado was tied or even ahead in the race the National Republican Congressional Committee released a disgusting deeply coded campaign ad that uses clips from Delgado's youthful flirtation with hip-hop (rapping under the handle "AD the Voice") as evidence that Faso's challenger was out of step with the values of the district and "unfit" to serve as their representative. The race-baiting led The New York Times to run an editorial condemning Faso. Other publications have followed suit.With any luck Faso's racist Hail Mary won't throw him a lifeline but an anvil. Given the demographics of the district and the nature of the race if Delgado wins it will be part of an overwhelming blue sweep of the midterm elections. Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion a featured writer for Quartz and other publications and the co-host of the podcast "They Call Us Bruce."Correction: An earlier version of this article attributed the ad about Antonio Delgado to John Faso's campaign. However the National Republican Congressional Committee is responsible for it. It also referred to the race as the New York Ninth but it is the New York Nineteenth. This article has also been corrected to give Gina Ortiz Jones' full name.,Opinion
Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book "The Opposite of Hate." The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Republicans seem worried about the prospect of their Judiciary Committee members questioning Christine Blasey Ford when she testifies on Thursday about her sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an allegation the nominee denies. They are concerned about the optics of having only Republican men interviewing Ford since there are no Republican female senators on the Judiciary Committee. And now according to The New Yorker a classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale Deborah Ramirez has come forward with an additional allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior by Kavanaugh -- which Kavanaugh has also denied. (CNN so far has not spoken to anyone who is willing to corroborate Ramirez's story.)In the face of these two allegations Republicans are right to be worried. The Republican Party's stock with women voters in the midterms -- and beyond -- is at stake.  In July when Kavanaugh's nomination was announced a Morning Consult/Politico poll suggested a slight plurality of voters supported his confirmation. And in a July Fox News poll 38% of voters said they would vote to confirm Kavanaugh while 32% said they would not confirm him and 30% were undecided.  But in polling conducted in the days after Ford made her allegations public the numbers had shifted -- and not in Kavanaugh's favor. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll more American voters now oppose Kavanaugh's nomination than support it. In that poll 38% of voters oppose Kavanaugh's confirmation while just 34% support it.That's a problem for Trump and Republicans in general but especially when it comes to women. As NBC reports "The increased opposition to Kavanaugh has come in particular from women over 50 (who were +3 on Kavanaugh's confirmation in August and are -7 now) (and) suburban women (-6 in August and -11 now)." The divide is still largely partisan. Republican women actually increased their support for Kavanaugh between August and the recent allegations while Democratic women decreased their support. But most significantly independent women had net support of 1% for Kavanaugh in August; they're now net opposed by 13%.  All this is before Christine Blasey Ford has even testified -- or been cross-examined by the Republican Judiciary Committee's flank of all men some of whom have suggested that Kavanaugh should be confirmed no matter what Ford says. "I'll listen to the lady but we're going to bring this to a close" said Sen. Lindsey Graham R-South Carolina. Later Graham added "Unless there's something more no I'm not going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life over this."  And Sen. Orrin Hatch R-Utah said that even if Ford's allegations were true "I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today" insisting that Kavanaugh is "a really good man."Still it will be hard not to view the way these men handle the accusations as a proxy for their party as a whole. And in recent days GOP politicians haven't helped their cause. Just consider Republican Rep. Ralph Norman joking that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was groped by Abraham Lincoln or Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher suggesting that even if Kavanaugh assaulted Ford it was back in high school so "Give me a break."  I don't think women in either party will take well to Republican men making light of serious allegations of sexual assault. Of course many of these same women voted for our current President who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women himself -- accusations which he too denies.  But will they keep overlooking the Republican Party's seemingly pervasive culture of misogyny? And how many other women will be newly motivated or extra motivated to kick the Grand Old Party out of office and replace them with candidates especially female candidates who take sexual assault claims seriously?  President Donald Trump was already slipping in his approval numbers among the white women voters who played a key role in his electoral college victory. For instance Ron Brownstein observes in the Atlantic "Compared to his 2016 vote his 2017 approval among blue-collar white women in the Rust Belt represented some of his largest declines anywhere -- 18 percentage points in Ohio and 19 in Wisconsin and Minnesota."And these latest allegations won't help Trump or his party's approval ratings -- unless Republicans take Ford and Ramirez's allegations seriously. To treat both women with respect and take the time needed to investigate is not a rush to judgment. This is about preserving the integrity of our Supreme Court and also sending a message to all Americans that sexual assault of any kind at any age is not okay. Republicans should handle this situation the right way because it's the right thing to do for our democracy and our society and our women. But Washington being Washington that's not always motivation enough.  Too many Republican politicians remain in the dark ages when it comes to even the most basic dynamics of gender equity and liberation. Botch this any further and the whole party could be cast into political darkness for generations.   ,Opinion
Michael D'Antonio is author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Donald Trump seems determined to replicate in a few short years as President all of the Washington scandals of the past 50 years from Watergate to the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings to the Hurricane Katrina debacle.Case in point: After first showing unusual restraint when Christine Blasey Ford came forward to say that she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh -- a claim he denies -- when the current Supreme Court nominee was a 17-year-old prep school student Trump on Friday did his best to own the controversy. He tweeted:"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date time and place!"Comparisons to the Clarence Thomas crisis of the George H. W. Bush administration are inevitable even though Bush himself did not behave as Trump has. Trump had no way of knowing about Blasey Ford's allegation of Kavanaugh when he nominated the judge for the Supreme Court but the President's handling of the matter has made it much worse. He has insulted her by calling her "the woman" and instead of asking the FBI to investigate as Bush did with Thomas he has said such probes are "not the FBI's thing." This is false.     Of course every scandal is unique so exact comparisons to the woes of earlier presidents cannot be drawn.  But the echoes are unmistakable  and have become impossible to ignore.Trump's response to the Kavanaugh situation may not be quite as bad as his reaction to the study that concluded that nearly 3000 people died because of Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico last year.  The President has said that he thinks the tally is false and was developed as a political attack. Puerto Rico has accepted the findings.With Maria already regarded as his version of President George W. Bush's slow response to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Trump's complaint confirmed that his hurricane debacle was proof of his cluelessness as well as his incompetence.Then of course there is the Russia investigation where the prosecution of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn brings to mind the classic Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.  Lesser quagmires have swallowed many of Trump's appointees.Among them: Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned amid ethical scandals; former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price who resigned when his use of private jets at taxpayer expense was revealed; and Rob Porter a White House staff secretary who resigned when domestic abuse allegations surfaced. Porter has denied the allegations. Remarkably only one administration official former national security adviser Flynn has been removed from office because of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But here again Trump in on pace to outperform four decades' worth of presidents. One has to go back more than 40 years to Nixon and Watergate to find as much evidence of campaign-related scandal as has been revealed during the Trump presidency.Campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents investigating the Russia scandal. In addition to Manafort the campaign chairman special counsel Robert Mueller had obtained a guilty plea from Rick Gates who served in the Trump campaign and in the transition. Michael Cohen who bragged about being the President's "fixer" has pleaded guilty to crimes related to buying the silence of Karen MacDougal and Stormy Daniels Trump's alleged extramarital sexual partners in order to aid the Trump campaign. Trump has denied the affairs.Daniels is suing Trump and her lawyer Michael Avenatti is seeking a sworn deposition from the President.  Avenatti is making the same demand on behalf of another client Summer Zervos who was among a number of women who have alleged sexual harassment by Trump. Trump has denied the allegations of the women including Zervos. Her defamation complaint has already put Trump in the position of having to answer written questions.   The peril Trump faces in the Daniels and Zervos matters appears similar to the presidential deposition in the Paula Jones civil suit which was a turning point in the scandal that enveloped Clinton in the late 1990s. Clinton's evasions and lying led to an impeachment trial. (Under oath during a deposition Clinton said that he did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.) He escaped being removed from office following a trial in the US Senate.Most of Trump's problems including the controversy affecting the Kavanaugh nomination have recent historical precedent but the number of crises impacting his administration does not. Trump's record is all the more striking because he follows a President Barack Obama who suffered only one cabinet resignation due to controversy -- former CIA Director David Petraeus who resigned after an FBI investigation confirmed that he was having an affair with his biographer -- in eight years.  Coming after No Drama Obama as he was called Trump has been one-man chaos machine.At the White House  insiders have been so aghast at Trump that in the words of the anonymous writer who penned the recent article in The New York Times  "many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office."Indeed the man who says he knows how to find and hire the best people has presided over a team in constant turmoil.  The appointees who stand between Trump and his worst instincts recognize what many of us feel. They and we don't need a complete accounting of the debacles to conclude that a temperamentally intellectually and morally unfit man occupies the Oval Office.,Opinion
This article is the first in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner the authors of the new book "The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence." The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Now familiar as a smiling nodding presence at the President's side Mike Pence was little known outside of his home state of Indiana when Donald Trump selected him as his running mate in 2016. A bit more than two years later as he crisscrosses America to campaign for Republicans in the midterm elections Pence is setting himself up to replace his boss if Trump leaves office early or does not seek re-election. "Mike will be ready" is the line Pence's aides and allies use as they contemplate his place in a post-Trump world.   Pence would never admit this. He plays the part of unctuous toady so fully that the conservative writer George Will called him "America's most repulsive public figure." But don't be fooled. The vice president is doggedly pursuing his own ambitions on the side. The Oval Office has been his goal since high school. He has seeded the federal government with his loyalists and is building his own nationwide political organization. He is acting in fact as if he is on a mission from God. Some may laugh but many conservative Christians believe that God is merely using Trump to prepare the way for a so-called true man of faith. Pence's rise to power would affirm the "Cyrus prophecy" which became a popular notion among Christian right circles when Pence joined the 2016 ticket.Cyrus was a Persian king whom the Old Testament credits with returning the Jews to Jerusalem. He was a pagan who nevertheless served God. Right-wing evangelists such as Lance Wallnau cited that tale in 2016 when they declared that Trump --  a profane and sinful man -- could nevertheless do God's work and was thus worthy of conservative Christian votes. An estimated 80% of white evangelicals gave Trump their votes. The story of Cyrus resonates with many right-wing Christians because they imagine themselves to be persecuted like the Jews of old. Despite their vast wealth power and numbers these believers cite developments such as same-sex marriage and the use of ecumenical phrases such as "happy holidays" instead of Merry Christmas as evidence they are a minority under siege. They imagine themselves to be victims of a culture war and feel that something must be done to defend an old order that they once dominated. As a radio host member of Congress and then governor of Indiana Pence made himself the most successful conservative Christian politician of his generation. Indeed he says he is "a Christian a conservative and a Republican in that order." During 12 years in Congress he never authored a single bill but he did become a prominent advocate for banning abortion defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting marriage only to heterosexual couples. In his one term as governor he overstepped when he signed a bill -- the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- permitting discrimination against gay people and was forced to seek a change in the law.  His rhetoric attacking abortion rights adultery and even evolution (he says he doesn't believe in it) assured the Christian right that he was one of them.   When Trump offered Pence his spot on the ticket the Republican Party's evangelical wing was over the moon.  Pence was also a first-term governor facing a tough battle for re-election despite a longstanding and substantial GOP advantage in voter registration. His outspoken support for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act had alienated some centrist Republicans and though Pence was genial enough he was not the kind of campaigner who got folks fired up.   Offered a path out of struggling obscurity in Indiana Pence didn't need a Bible prophecy to tell him it was OK to take the leap. He hitched his pious ambitions to a crude twice-divorced self-confessed sexual predator whose grasp of faith and Scripture appears nonexistent. Pence's favorite Bible verse reads: "For I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you and not harm you plans to give you hope and a future." He cites it when he discusses the opportunities that come his way and to explain the confidence he brings to politics.Pence's theology says that God selects in advance which individuals will become believers and rewards their faith regardless of what they do. This belief allows for all sorts of bad behavior if it can be framed as supporting the ultimate goal of promoting the evangelical agenda.     Pence's loyalty to the President even after the "Access Hollywood" tape exposed Trump as a serial sexual harasser  baffled many. It was reported at the time that Pence considered trying to replace Trump at the top of the ticket but in the end he held his place and his tongue. Pence's religion explains that choice and his decision to abandon many of his previous positions on the issues such as his opposition to banning Muslim visitors to America.To understand how a seemingly pious politician such as Pence could join Trump and stick with him requires tracing the long path of his ambition. Pence wasn't always the rigidly moralistic and confident conservative evangelical he professes to be today.  But he was from the beginning of his adult life a man who thought he was destined for the presidency. This article is the first in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner the authors of the new book "The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly indicated that President Trump was thrice divorced. He has been divorced twice.,Opinion

(CNN)The way in which America -- for years a self-proclaimed role model for human rights -- projects its values to the rest of the world has real tangible effects on the global stage. In the age of Donald Trump the US State Department has turned its back on the fight against racism and xenophobia. Even worse the agency seeks to remove anti-racist language from international documents. The US government has a racism issue and it is a dangerous problem with international implications.In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo six House Democrats said they are "extremely alarmed" the administration has remained silent regarding racism and xenophobia in international fora and has not condemned hate speech and incitement. They also noted that Andrew Veprek the deputy assistant secretary for refugees and migration rejected the notion that leaders have a "duty to condemn hate speech and incitement" and according to a report by CNN Veprek sought changes to UN human rights documents that denounce racism as a threat to democracy."The drafters say 'populism and nationalism' as if these are dirty words" Veprek wrote of one document. "There are millions of Americans who likely would describe themselves as adhering to these concepts. (Maybe even the President.) So are we looking to here condemn our fellow-citizens those who pay our salaries?" Further Veprek took issue with language in a UN Human Rights Council resolution which said national leaders have a duty to condemn hate speech. Veprek insisted that "'duty to condemn' goes too far. Our public figures can't be obliged to police every intolerant thought out their (sic) at the risk of being condemned for intolerance themselves.""This is dangerous policy" the lawmakers wrote to Pompeo. And they are right.These members of Congress are justifiably angry over America's retreat from world leadership under this President and "his racist and xenophobic policies have slammed America's door on some of the world's most desperate people" the Democrats wrote. "Ultimately this latest blunder amplifies the increasingly widespread perception that some officials in the Trump administration are racist and support an anti-foreigner anti-Muslim discriminatory agenda and further erodes our credibility on the world stage."    However outrageous the actions words and silence of the Trump White House on hate and intolerance the current situation is by no means surprising.Since President Trump once said that there were "some very fine people on both sides" when referring to violent white supremacists and Nazis marching with tiki torches in Charlottesville Virginia last year why would he downplay racism on the world stage?In his interview this past July with The Sun a British tabloid Trump decried immigration saying that migrants have "changed the fabric of Europe.""And I don't mean that in a positive way" he said. "I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very very sad. I think you're losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago."Trump has turned his beliefs into policy. Although the President hasn't released a statement about Veprek's comments the administration announced its withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council shortly after his proposed language changes.And some of Trump's current and former staff and advisers have been accused of neo-Nazi affiliations Islamophobia and having ties to white nationalists and white supremacists. These people have the ear of the President and are shaping foreign policy and immigration policy.Stephen Miller a White House adviser who is instrumental in immigration policy played a part in the administration's  Muslim travel ban and separating undocumented migrant children and parents from each other. He is also involved in plans to limit citizenship for documented immigrants and strip immigrants of their citizenship.Richard Grenell US ambassador to Germany faced calls for his expulsion for telling the alt-right white nationalist website Breitbart that he wanted to "empower" anti-establishment conservatives in Europe. Ronald Vitiello acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently attended an annual conference of the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform. At its conference this month the anti-Muslim group ACT for America honored former ICE Director Thomas Homan.In Trump hard-right politicians around the world seem to have found a common ground and have become more emboldened with their own racist and xenophobic policies and rhetoric.Russian President Vladimir Putin has cultivated ties with white nationalist politicians and groups in Europe and the United States. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a Trump cheerleader who supports hardline anti-immigration policies. Conte's interior minister has called for a census of the country's Roma people an ethnic group in order to expel them. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has found a friend in Trump and has enacted anti-immigrant "Stop Soros" laws to criminalize anyone who helps an undocumented immigrant file an asylum claim. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has called for an anti-migration axis with Germany and Italy. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted his country's own wall on the southern border with Egypt to keep out African "illegal infiltrators" who he said are worse than Sinai terrorists and threaten the livelihood of Israel's Jewish majority. Netanyahu's racist nation-state law declares self-determination for the Jewish people and encourages segregated communities but omits any mention of equality and minority group rights. Thanks to a government that has abdicated its leadership on the fight against hate America's positive role on the international stage is diminishing. How can the United States ever hope to combat racism in the world when its leader seems to be helping to spread it?,Opinion

A President who boasted about sexual assault has nominated a judge for an empty Supreme Court seat -- and a woman has accused that judge of physical and sexual assault an accusation he vehemently denies. The outcome of the hearings could decide the fate of women's bodily autonomy for the foreseeable future.Initially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have tried to persuade Trump to nominate two other judges instead of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Why? Because according to the New York Times McConnell was concerned about Kavanaugh's long paper trail which includes millions of pages detailing his time on the bench and working in the George W. Bush White House. McConnell according to sources who briefed the Times had little desire to revisit the Bush-era controversies including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques -- aka torture -- which Kavanaugh upheld the use of in several cases. And though McConnell lost that battle his party quickly united around Kavanaugh moving his confirmation process along at warp speed. Shortly after Senator Dianne Feinstein the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee referred the woman's allegation of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court nominee to the FBI Republican Chuck Grassley chair of the Judiciary committee released a letter in which 65 women vouched for Kavanaugh's character in high school. This potentially indicates that after a rushed confirmation hearing process some within the Republican Party may have known of this allegation and moved forward with his nomination nonetheless. If so this further proves that Senate Republicans are utterly out of step with the #MeToo generation.Going forward Republicans are faced with a spectrum of terrible options. They could continue to rush through the confirmation process and attempt to discredit the alleged victim -- Christine Blasey Ford a professor in California who offered the Washington Post a detailed account of what she describes as her traumatic experience and its aftermath and even passed a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent.If they do so they may lose crucial Republican votes which they cannot afford in the current 51-49 split. If they don't lose enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh Republicans may pay the price this November thanks to a fired up Democrat electorate and already growing group of disgruntled independents. Meanwhile the endless onslaught of scandals could depress the turnout of even dyed-in-the wool Republican women.Their other option is to slow down the confirmation process and allow Ford to testify about her experience which will offer the nation a test -- to see how far we've come since the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings 27 years ago. At that time an all-male Senate judiciary committee ruled in favor of Thomas and dismissed the accusations of Hill a Yale-educated law professor who had accused Thomas of sexual harassment while they worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Notably Hill has called for a "fair and neutral" process to investigate the claim against Kavanaugh. Ford's testimony could stand as a harrowing indictment of Kavanaugh's abject unfitness to sit on the Supreme Court. After all her allegation is not one of a merely inappropriate comment but of sexual assault. If true in a just world the price for allegedly holding a girl down attempting to remove her clothes turning up music so no one can hear her protests and muffling her screams until she manages to escape should be quite high.Furthermore if Republican senators attempt to impugn her character they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the American people. Public opinion however is unlikely to view his alleged crime with such clemency. Yes Republicans could gamble that the nation that heard the "Access Hollywood" tape and still elected Donald Trump will vote this November in favor of his party. While Trump didn't deny the statements on the tape he did deny he put his words into action. However at least 15 women have accused Trump of much more than sleazy words -- and he has denied each allegation. And yes Kavanaugh denies the accusation that was made against him when he -- unlike Trump -- was still a minor. That said the allegation against Kavanaugh is far more severe -- it's based on action not just words -- and is more likely to ignite the civic passions of people who may have sat out the last election because they did not feel enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. Anyone can make unfounded allegations to try and thwart someone's career and if it isn't true the person shouldn't be summarily dismissed. However if further testimony corroborates Ford's claim the only way Republicans stand a chance in the upcoming elections and in the judgment of history is to take an unequivocal stand against predators on the Supreme Court and in the White House.,Opinion

One would hope you'd show more respect for women. As a coach you've mentored hundreds of young men to go on to lead successful lives from high school to Grambling State University to your current NFL role as SVP of Player Personnel for Washington's NFL team. You talk a good game about being a man of character almost every chance you get. I've heard you myself -- and foolishly I believed you. Despite all that you're now trying to justify the hiring of linebacker Reuben Foster almost immediately after he was arrested on one count of first-degree misdemeanor domestic-violence battery against his on-again-off-again girlfriend.  Foster's former team the San Francisco 49ers had the decency to fire Reuben less than 12 hours after his arrest citing a welcome new team policy: any player who commits domestic violence will no longer have a place on their team.  No other team would touch Foster when he became available -- could be this is a sign of progress in the NFL that team owners coaches are getting the message that coddling domestic abusers is bad for business? Apparently Williams and his boss team owner Dan Snyder have decided to play by different rules:  Said Williams in a statement: "If true you can be sure these allegations are nothing our organization would ever condone." Odd. While the statement also alluded to "numerous steps" Foster would have to go through before being allowed to play this sure sounds like Williams condones the allegations -- or at least is willing to look past them to get a good linebacker. Williams added that joining the team would be the "best possible environment (for Reuben) to succeed both personally and professionally." As if the best treatment for men who abuse women is to surround them with friends give them a high-paying job and put them on TV every week. It's almost laughable. And one more disturbing example of how the NFL continues to excuse misogyny and abuse against women.But dismissing women also comes at a high price. Williams likely forgot that women make up nearly 45% of the NFL fanbase. We also decide more times than not whether we will allow our sons to even play the game or buy that next NFL jersey. Keeping female fans is a matter of survival for the NFL and moves like Foster's hire only disconnect women further from the game. Men like Foster may have gone unnoticed before Ray Rice the former Baltimore Raven who was caught on video violently attacking his fiancée in 2014. Foster's arrest may have received little attention before #MeToo before we women put aside our fears and raised our voices to demand consequences for men who use their power to abuse and harass us.We know our power. If the league intends to keep women watching and spending on the NFL it cannot keep justifying guys like Reuben Foster. I've met and worked with Doug Williams. I've always liked him -- since the day he became the first black quarterback to win a Super Bowl in 1988 destroying the myth that blacks were not smart enough to be signal callers. Williams has been a folk hero to many in the black community. I want him to succeed. "Black folks want Doug Williams to win" wrote Jason Reid of ESPN's Undefeated when Williams was hired last year.  I agree. We want Williams to win but not like this. This feels like losing to me. ,Opinion

She reports this soon after she says it happened. The girl is taken to a hospital and undergoes a forensic exam intended to recover DNA evidence -- her rape kit. But charges are not filed because police struggle with what is admittedly one of the toughest crimes to investigate. The child's untested rape kit is put on a shelf in an evidence room.Now imagine 20 years have passed and that child is an adult better equipped to comprehend and confront what happened to her at such a young and vulnerable age. Maybe she also knows another person -- a sibling a neighbor a friend from school -- who says the uncle abused them in the same way years ago. The woman emboldened wanting justice feels compelled to face her abuser and try to make sure he never preys on someone again.And she is fortunate in one small way: The state where her abuse was reported all those years ago has a long statute of limitations on child sex crimes. Her case can still be prosecuted.Now imagine the victim learning this: Her rape kit is gone. Destroyed by police. And never tested.We have both spent our careers working in the area of child sex abuse. One of us is a child psychiatrist and expert in child and adolescent trauma; the other a lawyer and professor who founded the nonprofit CHILD USA and has worked to spread the wisdom of extending the lengths of time in which children who are sexually abused can seek justice. The priest sex abuse scandal sadly shows that it can take years even decades for young victims to disclose their abuse. And because of that the existence of forensic evidence in children's cases is rare.So imagine our shock and pain at learning that police have destroyed children's and teenagers' rape kits.As part of its groundbreaking investigation into the destruction of rape kits published this week CNN sought our expertise. We examined documents tied to nearly 200 cases in which the rape kits of minors were destroyed. We were appalled to see that in some cases the destruction of this evidence occurred before the statute of limitations expired and that there appeared to be no protocol for preserving the rape kits of victims who were children and teenagers.As DNA technology has advanced so has the movement to extend and eliminate child sex abuse statutes of limitation.  Since 2002 38 states and the District of Columbia have amended their statutes to make it easier for victims to gain access to justice.In some states lawmakers have added a provision that eliminates the statute of limitations if DNA evidence is discovered.  All the more reason that the mishandling of child rape kits uncovered by CNN is an outrage and the destruction of rape kits while prosecutions were still possible is an atrocity.It can take many years for a child to gain the cognitive ability or the emotional stability to put the pieces together of their assault and provide useful information about the crime and the perpetrator.What happens when they are mature enough and find out that the evidence obtained years earlier is gone and they have no pathway to justice? Justice denied is literally traumatic. Victims can lose faith in the justice system and are less likely to rely on civil authorities. They may relive the betrayal from the original traumatic experience and become increasingly distrustful of others. They may become less functional or depressive because of post-traumatic stress or exhibit other psychiatric symptoms.In the United States 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused before age 18. Studies have shown that child victims do not come forward until they are adults -- on average at the age of 52. And then defendants argue that memories are defective and hope that the passage of time will protect them.For the child who grows up and seeks justice a rape kit and DNA report are invaluable.The first step to better practices is a rigorous study to determine how widely and how often children's rape kits have been destroyed and determine where gaps in knowledge or clear procedures are causing the testing and preservation of kits to go awry.Based on our review of the documents provided by CNN it appeared that destruction of this evidence was not the result of malevolence but systemic issues facing law enforcement and the courts. There is also an apparent lack of awareness that the criminal statutes of limitations for child sex assault have been eliminated in 39 states and in federal statutes. We expect those numbers to rise as the logic of extending statutes of limitations for minors continues to take hold.If state lawmakers have made the decision that a child sex abuse victim should have all the time the victim needs to pursue criminal charges it is incumbent on the legal system to preserve what may be the best evidence for that later prosecution.Otherwise the movement to lengthen and eliminate the time limits to prosecute may be more of a shallow victory than a meaningful one for the most vulnerable victims. ,Opinion

(CNN)When I was a kid in Detroit the neighborhood of Poletown was a thriving ethnic enclave of Polish restaurants churches and recent immigrants. Then something terribly wrong happened: Most of the neighborhood was destroyed in 1981 to build a new General Motors plant. The city helped the corporation by using eminent domain to seize and bulldoze 1500 homes and hundreds of businesses. There were other places to build of course but GM wanted that location and the City of Detroit was happy to oblige.Several years after the neighborhood was cleared to make way for GM the company did what it too often does: build the wrong car. It used the Poletown factory known as the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to manufacture the Cadillac Allante a two-seater that cost around $50000 in 1987. Why did it cost so much? Well for one thing the body was built in Italy and then flown to Detroit. Seriously GM did this: They used custom jets to fly 56 frames at a time from Italy to Detroit. A GM manager expected buyers to "form a double line" to buy the car. As one might expect things didn't turn out as planned. The exorbitant price along with other problems like leaky roofs killed the car's reputation and the plant went on to focus largely on producing Cadillacs Buicks and Chevys.This week GM announced it was planning to slash about 14000 jobs and halt production at the Poletown plant along with four other factories. Bulldozing Poletown homes to make room for the plant was just one of many benefits GM sponged from the public and it pales in comparison to the federal bailout under the Obama administration that saved the company from its own mistakes. And yet all of those benefits along with a corporate tax cut under Trump did not matter in the end.GM plans to stop the production of several sedans and focus on better-selling (and less fuel-efficient) SUVs and trucks while investing in the development of electric and driverless cars. I certainly believe the first part of this -- I have no doubt that GM will roll out as many gas-guzzling Suburbans as Texas moms can buy. I don't believe for a second though that there is much chance that GM will eventually pivot to electric vehicles or autonomous cars. It's telling that the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt and the Cadillac CT6 which includes the company's most advanced autonomous driving features are among the models GM is killing off. While the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt is still in production the decision to dump a plug-in hybrid -- which is still considered innovative even if it isn't on the cutting edge -- in order to focus on trucks and SUVs is a step backwards by any calculation.While it's not too late for GM to change course companies are so often obsessed with short-term profit that they usually find it nearly impossible to sustain long-term vision. GM's management will change. Investors will insist on short-term fixes to prop up stock prices. The talent they need will turn out to be expensive. It's all too likely that GM will prioritize giant SUVs only to get caught flat-footed and count on another bailout when the market changes (as it inevitably will). And once again our tax money will be used to prop up corporate losers. That's not how taxes or capitalism are supposed to work. GM wants to avoid the fate of Sears which declared bankruptcy earlier this year after failing to adapt to an economy that had largely moved to the internet. But many of us forget that Sears helped invent an early cornerstone of the internet. In the 1980s Sears and IBM developed a pioneering online service called Prodigy that offered everything from message boards to online shopping. I actually signed up for Prodigy around 1989 and it was a revelation at the time -- I could buy plane tickets or clothes online! Sure it was over a dial-up modem but it was still fabulous. Prodigy became the first consumer network to provide access to the World Wide Web. Far from ignoring the internet Sears actually got there first. But then it got distracted. By 1996 Sears wasn't making enough money from the venture and Prodigy was sold for $200 million.Modern publicly held corporations simply are not built to sustain a long-term vision and General Motors is particularly bad at it. A few years after Sears abandoned its pioneering work on the internet GM walked away from its own first effort to roll out modern electric cars. In the 1990s GM developed and leased the EV1 an innovative electric car with a range of about 100 miles. It was a good commuter car that was beloved by those who leased it but in 2003 GM took the cars back and crushed nearly all of them. Then it quit worrying about electric cars until the next crisis hit.No matter how much we want corporations to act in the public interest we need to accept that it just won't happen the way we would hope. Corporations aren't built to benefit the public at large; they are designed and run to benefit their current stockholders. In the end this is the harsh truth both the President of the United States and the thousands of GM workers faced this week: Don't fall in love with GM. It will not love you back.,Opinion

(CNN)My coffee shop stopped taking cash the other week. It came as a shock providing as it once did an opportunity to offload pockets of change or the satisfaction of throwing a dollar bill into the tip jar. The green stuff was tangible and knowable. You could hold it feel it and smell it (although my advice is that it's best not to). Not like the new computer system with its plastic its bytes and its invisible cloud. That's roughly what ran through my head when I heard that the kilogram -- the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) -- had this month been redefined into mathematical abstraction.Until now if you wanted to touch hold or drop the official kilogram which is equivalent to 2.2 pounds on your toe then it was a simple matter of visiting a tightly guarded vault inside the Louis XIV Pavillon de Breteuil outside Paris where "Le Grand K" was kept in elegant repose beneath a triple layer of glass covers to protect it from picking up even a molecule of contaminants.But tragically the metal cylinder was not immune to the inevitabilities of its old age. Time had stripped it of about 50 micrograms of its original mass and in doing so stripped it of its identity. Le Grand K is no longer a kilogram. Before the kilogram came into being the unit of mass was the "grave" equivalent to the mass of a liter of water at freezing point. But after French revolutionaries toppled the aristocracy in 1789 the new French government decided to revolutionize weights and measures replacing the grave with the much-loved gram. Soon after a mass artifact a thousand times the mass of a gram and a much more practical size for a base measurement was created.  Either way an ingot of platinum-iridium or a block of ice the unit was real touchable and knowable. It could be placed on a scale and physically balanced against any object. This is how measurements once worked. Units of weight were determined by the weight of grains. The pied du roi or "king's foot" was used for 1000 years as a unit of length in France coming in at about 32.5 cm a fraction longer than the foot being used in England at the time and that we have come to know today. Just right for Gallic pride. It is difficult not to miss that sort of folk history when considering the new kilogram. Out goes Le Grand K and in comes the Kibble balance a complicated bit of kit that measures the electromagnetic force required to offset the weight of a specific mass. It's a heck of a lot more difficult to explain than a lump of metal in France but suffice to say that it balances mechanical force on the one hand with electromagnetic force on the other. The quantity that the Kibble balance spits out is then expressed as a function of one of the universe's fundamental constants the Planck Constant. It is beautiful universal and yes constant. It won't change with temperature or microscopic deposits. And it is democratic. There need be no weights and measures authority with white gloves and disapproving looks no keeper of the metal ingot. Anyone (with sufficient expertise) can build a Kibble balance. All pluses. But simple it is not. The kilogram follows the other SI units that have gone from (relatively) straightforward to mind-numbingly complex. The meter once a ten-millionth of the distance from Equator to North Pole is now the length travelled by light in 1/299792458th of a second inside a vacuum.  Where's the poetry in that? Where's the history that connects mass with the Romans the French Revolution and the very human requirement to occasionally scrub Le Grand K clean of deposits as if the kilogram were a baby to be protected from the world? What does the Planck constant even feel like? So let's stick with the old ways or switch altogether from the metric system to America's Imperial system. If feet and inches were good enough to put a man on the moon they're good enough for me. Just don't try to tell me that the American pound is measured as 0.453592 of one of your newfangled kilogram. It will always be about the weight of a pint of a milk.,Opinion
Stephen J. Pyne is a professor in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University and the author of "Between Two Fires: A Fire History of Contemporary America" and "To the Last Smoke" a series of regional fire surveys.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)In October 1918 a swarm of smoldering fires flared and rode rising winds through 1500 square miles outside Duluth Minnesota.  The flames incinerated cities killed at least 450 people and overtook evacuees as they fled in cars.  It wasn't the last fire of a cycle that began in 1825 in Maine and migrated through the Lake States before moving on but it was the last in which the fallen numbered in the hundreds.  Then over several decades the scene calmed.  That former era of firestorms was sparked along the frontier.  Settlers and logging companies felled the forests and left lands lathered in slash. They used fires widely to work the land into agriculture. They built houses and towns out of wood and they lacked much incentive to prevent burning or the capacity to fight the fires that blew up. Railroads cast sparks with abandon.  Year after year decade after decade the sorrowful scenario repeated.  But after the 1918 eruption the rising tide ebbed.  This did not occur spontaneously. Cities gradually adopted fire and building codes and enforced them. They zoned in ways to halt fire spread and ensure egress.  They installed a fire protection infrastructure.  Individual buildings and a town block burned here and there but fires in cities no longer spread like fires in forests. The countryside also changed.  Settlement ceased and logging and its slash heaps were more or less domesticated. The wild and the settled were untangled into separate realms routine burning on the landscape yielded to internal combustion and firefighting agencies matured. By the mid-20th century the horrific fires had faded replaced with occasional outbreaks more akin to seasonal flu than an epidemic on the order of the Spanish flu (which incidentally had begun earlier in 1918).  Now the flames are back.  Why?  Because the conditions that spawned the era of frontier fires have found modern surrogates.  A new wave of settlement is recolonizing our formerly rural lands this time converting to towns or exurbs often out of materials similar to that of their surroundings.  Building codes and zoning are often feeble or have come decades after indifferent attention. Fire protection has strengthened but it also eliminated as a consequence the "good" smaller blazes that had formerly pruned back fuels that might otherwise feed a conflagration. The countryside matured sometimes in unhelpful ways because of the success of fire exclusion campaigns.  Geographies that had been painfully segregated remixed as suburbs and pushed against wildlands while urban enclaves and exurbs found themselves amid revanchist woods.   Climate change lengthened fire seasons and worsened some of the conditions that allowed vegetation to convert into fuel.  It assumed the role of performance enhancer that slash had earlier previously served. The fires mutated from occasional nuisances into menaces.The problem manifested itself most dramatically in postwar California and was dismissed as a California quirk. Then it infected much of the American West with flames rushing around Spokane Reno the Wasatch Front and -- with particular venom -- Colorado's Front Range. Then they moved into the Great Plains then outside Austin Texas the coastal plains and Gatlinburg Tennessee. At first the prevailing narrative was one of dumb Californians (or westerners) putting houses where there were bound to be fires.  Increasingly thanks to climate change and land use the narrative is becoming one of fires going to where the houses are.       What can we do to turn the tide again? We can relearn the lessons of that last-century plague.  Most basically we need to define the problem correctly.The "wildland-urban interface" is a dumb geeky name coined in California in the early 1970s.  It viewed the problem of wildfires from the perspective of wildlands. By then the wildland fire community -- that is the federal agencies (such as the National Park Service and Forest Service) and some state and private institutions that were concerned with fire on landscapes -- had admitted the self-destructive folly of trying to exclude all fire from all lands and had committed to restoring "good" fire. It defined the problem as one of encroaching houses and the loss of a rural buffer zone.  It knew it could not eliminate all fires and couldn't afford to since in most landscapes fire was both inevitable and necessary.  But it saw those fires getting more savage and knew that new houses compromised attempts to contain fires as a wildland issue.But we might equally view the problem from the other side of the interface that is from cities and sprawling towns. Suburbs and exurbs are fringes and fragments of cities with peculiar landscaping. They are amenable to the methods that tamed America's urban blazes in that earlier era: fire codes life safety codes building codes zoning an infrastructure for urban fire protection.  Such a redefinition makes sense because plenty of research not only in the US but in Australia and elsewhere points to ember swarms as the primary ignition source in threatened communities. Blizzards of sparks from an advancing fire act on the structure itself and on the flammable material -- shrubs mulch and pine needles --immediately around it.  This "home ignition zone"as it's called holds the critical points of vulnerability. It's where fire enters the built environment.  Similarly we know that fires occur in patterns -- as do winds such as those blasting California -- and like flood plains they map zones of high risk.  They help identify what communities need the most urgent attention.  (Malibu has burned so often for example it might make sense to highlight decades without a "disaster" fire.)Yes the countryside needs treatment as well.  We can dampen the ferocity of the flames -- the size of fires will depend mostly on the winds but their intensity will depend on the fuel characteristics of the landscape.  The home ignition zone has a counterpart around whole communities -- a "community ignition zone."  There are lots of techniques for treating such areas for fashioning the fire equivalent of greenbelts  around communities and municipal watersheds.  We can also begin to substitute prescribed semi-tame flames for the feral fires that now result from accidents lightning and power lines which function today as railroads did a century ago.  But we need to choose solutions that make sense in terms of how fire behaves and kindles structures.  Felling the woods will worsen the scene unless you clean up afterwards. This can be expensive and brings its own hazards from burning the slash which can lead to other fires and noxious smoke. We can't stop winds and abolish vegetation and eliminate fires.  We can make communities sufficiently resilient to accept those outbursts without burning to stone and killing residents.  We can go beyond thoughts and prayers and the misbegotten sense that mass burnings must echo mass shootings in their random destruction and our helplessness to stop them. A century ago the horror of the 1918 outbreak marked a tipping point. The flames were tamed. And they can be tamed again. Let's hope this fire bust piling on top of those in August and last fall announces the ebb.,Opinion

(CNN)It's China's biological Sputnik launched by a rogue scientist. A Chinese scientist has claimed he has succeeded in editing the genes of twin girls Lulu and Nana in a medical first that is shocking -- for its secrecy its needlessness and what it suggests about the culture of medical research in China.Since the debut of the biotechnology CRISPR-cas9 in 2012 this day seemed inevitable -- despite endless warnings from bioethicists and a wide variety of scientific bodies. Hours after the announcement that the twins were born "a few weeks ago" with modified DNA the technique's co-creator Feng Zhang called for an immediate halt to such trials. CRISPR is a kind of search-and-destroy or search-and-replace for the human genome. Normally RNA molecules spawned through DNA transcription serve as the blueprint for proteins. But by pairing RNA with the aid of a DNA cutting enzyme called cas9 the CRISPR technique can snip out a particular DNA sequence turning off genes or replacing them with other DNA. And since scientists can easily generate an RNA pair for any sequence of DNA (the underlying biological code in each human cell) CRISPR has the potential to cure countless genetic diseases. But the CRISPR technique isn't perfect and in every few hundred cases in what is referred to as "off-target events" it can edit the wrong portion of DNA potentially creating unwanted mutations. Less controversial trials are already underway involving humans after birth. This kind of gene editing revises somatic cells the kind that are not passed on to our offspring. But when a scientist edits the genes in an embryo prior to implantation into the womb the germ line is altered. That means the laboratory edits could be passed along to all subsequent generations springing forth from this individual. Germline editing is highly controversial but has been theoretically condoned under a range of strict criteria and regulations -- all of which include complete transparency within the experimental trial. (The one exception being the details of identification for the participants which may be kept secret.) Which is to say no one wanted this kind of trial done in secret. But secrecy is exactly what the Chinese scientist appears to have chosen. He did not publicly announce his plans to conduct the trial or allow for the scientific community to debate its merits before announcing his findings this week. And in that secrecy Dr. He Jiankui of Shenzen's Southern University of Science and Technology went forward with an ethically flawed research plan choosing to edit the gene CCR5 so that it was no longer functional. People without working CCR5 genes are more resistant to HIV infection. The researchers targeted couples in which one partner has HIV offering the hope they can give birth to an HIV-free and HIV-resistant child. In the case of the former it's already possible to prevent HIV transmission via sperm washing and assisted fertilization. And in the case of the latter while gene editing might be effective in providing some degree of long-term HIV immunity this has not been proven in humans yet. Furthermore HIV vulnerability isn't a disease state -- it's our normal condition; we're all HIV vulnerable unless we happen to be one of the rare people with a naturally occurring CCR5 mutation. And frankly there are simple proven ways to prevent the vast majority of HIV transmission events: safe sex and avoidance of contaminated needles. Most disturbing CCR5 makes the children He has edited more prone to dying from the far more common influenza virus. In a troubling twist the Associated Press reports that American scientist Michael Deem a professor of bioengineering at Rice University appears to have participated in the work. Deem told the Associated Press he was in China when the study's participants consented and that they seemed aware of the risks involved. CNN reached out to Deem for comment but he did not reply.American research universities typically demand some level of oversight and awareness of their researchers' activities -- regardless of where in the world they are working. Rice University is now investigating Deem's alleged involvement. Rice's spokesperson told me in an email that "this work as described in press reports violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University."An American Institutional Review Board the kind of local body of clinicians scientists ethicists and community members responsible for ensuring human subjects research is sufficiently safe and balances interests of the patient and community would not have approved this study. Though the Chinese university has denied knowledge of the study and said it violates their standards and the Chinese government has ordered an investigation into the study that the work was done in China is hardly surprising (and not only because He himself is Chinese.) Last fall according to ClinicalTrials.gov 9 out of the 10 CRISPR trials listed were taking place in China.Why? It's likely because China has a much more lax regulatory structure than in Europe or the United States allowing relatively informal hospital ethics committees to approve novel genetic research. In Europe and the United States multiple layers of national regulators provide checks and balance to highly formalized medical trials -- slowing the research process. But this lax structure has gotten China into trouble before. In 2015 two of the world's top scientific journals Nature and Science both cited ethical objections in rejecting the first paper reporting on genetic editing of a human embryo -- work that took place in China. Protein and Cell the journal that did publish the study did so it claimed only to "sound an alarm" on the scientists who had carried out the study. It is also dismaying to think an American research professor could have assisted in the project in any capacity.In a YouTube video He says that the birth of the world's first IVF child 40 years ago was greeted with a storm of controversy but that the procedure is now routine and he expects his announcement to be no different. In truth there is no parallel. Fertilization of an egg outside the human body carries with it no change to the body of the subsequent child and has no impact on future generations.  But we don't need to imagine future transgressions in order to condemn this action. What kind of human rights violation is it called when ambitious scientists secretly make decisions that alter the human race? Will the Chinese government work to strengthen their regulatory framework to prevent future ethically questionable studies -- rather than just condemning the work of He in this particular incident? He and Deem should not be rewarded for merely first doing what many others could have done were it not for their own scruples. Without condemnation we are giving a license to a gene race which is far riskier than a space race ever was. ,Opinion
Les Abend recently retired after 34 years as a Boeing 777 captain for American Airlines. He is a CNN aviation analyst and senior contributor to Flying magazine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.  As with most airplane accidents the tragedy of Lion Air Flight 610 could have been prevented. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on November 6 plunging into the Java Sea and killing all 189 people on board. First this accident is still in the field investigation process; until the results of that probe are in it's important to avoid speculation.  But people who travel by air understandably want to know: is it safe to get on a Boeing 737 MAX plane? The 737 MAX the doomed model in this crash and the most popular plane in Boeing history is flown by (or on order for) close to 40 airlines according to the Washington Post.Let's look at what we know so far.  The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) that was recovered and analyzed indicates some very disturbing circumstances here -- ones that should infuriate pilots who fly these planes. The 737 MAX is an airframe design that dates back to 1967.  It is the latest in Boeing's line-up includes a "fly-by-wire" (that is computer controlled) electronic flight control system and highly efficient turbofan engines. Because the engines are also more powerful and heavier than previous versions of the airplane the tendency for an "underslung" (under the wing) mounted engine to cause the nose of the airplane to rise when thrust is increased especially at lower airspeeds becomes more pronounced.  Boeing compensated for the nose-up tendency by programming the flight control computers to apply nose-down stabilizer trim automatically a function that is invisible to the pilot even when hand-flying the airplane.  This additional Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was added to provide protection against an aerodynamic stall which mostly occurs at lower airspeed by programming the computer to stop pilots from raising the nose: in short it fights pilot input to prevent the plane from stalling.  The trigger for the MCAS system is the angle of attack (AOA) detector which measures the angle between the wings and the air flow. If the AOA detects an approaching stall the MCAS is activated. In Lion Air's situation it appears that the AOA was faulty transmitting erroneous data. The pilots unsuccessfully struggled to wrestle control of the airplane away from the computer. Having spent my entire airline career on Boeing airplanes I've always liked their philosophy of designing the electronics to work in harmony with the pilot rather than protecting the airplane from the pilot. The MCAS system seems to represent the latter. But here is why 737 pilots (and everyone else) should be angry: The MCAS system was apparently not specifically described in the airplane operation manual. (Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that the information was available as part of the manual. CNN has asked Boeing for a copy of the original manuals issued to carriers who bought the Boeing 737 MAX 8 but Boeing has not provided those operation manuals to CNN.) According to experienced pilots the system was never included in previous versions of the airplane.  How can pilots compensate for a malfunction if they are not aware of how it works? And recognition is key. If crews don't understand the abnormality they can't react via an appropriate emergency checklist. For Lion Air their altitude of 5000 feet didn't leave much time to analyze the situation and then react. Boeing is now reportedly taking the unprecedented step of not only briefing customers -- that is airlines using the 737 MAX -- but also involving the pilots' unions.  And as of November 9 a procedure that involves pilots disconnecting the stabilizer trim switches in the cockpit is now included in flight manuals as a solution to Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) warning messages that relate to faulty sensors.  I worked as an airline pilot for 34 years and this very rapid response is in my experience unprecedented.  Some reports indicate that the AOA detection system may have malfunctioned on previous flights with another crew. Was the malfunction repaired according to Boeing's procedures? Was it the same malfunction experienced by the accident crew? Did the airplane react the same way on the Lion Air accident flight? Did the malfunction on the previous flight occur at a higher and safer altitude? The answers to these questions are what the ongoing investigation will determine. Is the 737 MAX a safe airplane? The short answer is "Yes." Now that pilots are armed with better knowledge of the MCAS system and have a quick solution for related abnormalities the airplane is even safer.  But Boeing still has a lot of explaining to do.,Opinion
Dr. Leana Wen (@DrLeanaWen) is the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Previously she was the health commissioner for the city of Baltimore. The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)In my life as an immigrant living in low-income communities as an emergency physician and as a public health advocate I have seen more preventable deaths than I can count or recall. When I was 10 years old my neighbor died in front of me of an asthma attack because he and his family were undocumented immigrants and his grandmother was afraid of what would happen if they called an ambulance for help. I watched other neighbors cut their blood-pressure pills in half and ration their insulin then succumb to consequences of untreated hypertension and diabetes -- all because they couldn't access affordable health care. Later as an emergency physician I treated a young woman who was rushed into the ER by the paramedics. She was lying on a stretcher in a pool of blood and by the time she got to us she was pulseless and unresponsive. It turned out that she didn't have access to health care so she had her cousin attempt an abortion on her at home. We did everything we could to resuscitate her but she died. Over and over again I have also seen our health care system fail women because of discriminatory policies.One patient of mine -- a mother of three -- waited a full year before making an appointment to have a lump in her breast examined and by the time I saw her the cancer had spread throughout her body. She waited to seek medical attention because she lacked health insurance and had been too afraid to go to the doctor. But that fear had a cost: her life. Had her cancer been detected and treated earlier she might have lived. I also know -- from my experiences as an 8-year-old girl new to this country and my years as the health commissioner of Baltimore -- that no one should fear seeking treatment because of their citizenship status gender identity income sexual orientation race or religion. Over the past century Planned Parenthood has done so much to bring reproductive health care to millions of people.Everything I've learned as a public health leader has led me to this conclusion: the threat to women's health is the greatest public health catastrophe of our time. Planned Parenthood's work -- bringing affordable and accessible health care to as many women (and men and all people) as possible -- isn't just the right thing to do. It's the urgent thing to do.  Keeping people unhealthy is a tool of oppression. People who aren't healthy can't participate fully in the economy. They may face barriers to care for their families. They may not be able to complete their education. The Trump administration knows this and they have enacted many policies to take care -- and power -- away from women LGBTQ communities communities of color people with low income and immigrants. Already one in five women in this country have been to Planned Parenthood for care. I am proud to include myself among them. Like a lot of young people I knew I could rely on them for reproductive health care provided with compassion respect and genuine concern. As president I plan to continue that legacy.Our mission -- to provide care no matter what -- is now more important than ever. If you need proof look at the Trump administration's reaction to the midterms. After months of organizing led largely by women and in particular women of color the American people elected a record number of women and a wave of health care champions to the US Congress.Yet less than 24 hours later the Trump administration finalized a rule that would allow employers to deny their employees birth control coverage if they cite religious objections. It's 2018 and we're still debating birth control!  Nine out of 10 women will use contraceptives at some point in her lifetime. It's standard health care. Just like breast exams. Just like well-woman exams. Just like abortion which like birth control is recognized in medicine to be part of the full spectrum of reproductive health care. The Trump administration's attack on birth control is only the latest in a series including a gag rule and other changes to Title X the nation's only program for affordable birth control and other reproductive health care; changes to the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program which we fought in Baltimore (and won); and efforts to block people who rely on Medicaid from coming to Planned Parenthood for preventive health care including birth control. Meanwhile with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court the right to safe legal abortion is on the line like never before.Already there are significant barriers to accessing abortion. In the last seven years over 400 laws have passed that directly restrict abortion care. Pretending they are trying to "protect women" states like Missouri and North Carolina have enacted 72-hour waiting periods and others like Iowa and soon Ohio are passing laws outright banning abortions after six weeks when many women don't even know that they are pregnant. If Roe v. Wade were overturned or further eroded Planned Parenthood assesses that 25 million women -- 1 in 3 women of reproductive age in this country -- would be living in states where abortion is outlawed or even criminalized. As a new Congress begins and new governors and state legislatures prepare to do the work of the people they have a mandate -- from women LGBTQ people immigrants people of color and all who believe that health care is a human right -- to fight for reproductive health care and women's health care as the standard health care that they are.The new political reality means we have an opportunity to expand access to care and we are committed to rising to that challenge.Our more than 600 health centers will continue to provide lifesaving and life-changing health care to our patients around the country and we will continue to fight to defend access to that care -- including the right to safe legal abortion. As president I will also look to expand our care our services and our impact. We will focus on reducing health disparities and meeting the needs of women families and communities.There are battles ahead. But there also countless opportunities to build a healthier more equitable world. At Planned Parenthood we have never been more ready to make that world a reality.,Opinion

(CNN)It is a truth universally acknowledged that any festival which celebrates feelings of goodwill and altruism must be accompanied by a shopping frenzy. Thus it was decreed that Thanksgiving should be followed by Black Friday Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday.  But when it was pointed out six years ago that three days of commercial exploitation was now heavily overbalancing a single Thanksgiving day allocated for wholesome domesticity the 92nd Street Y and the United Nations Foundation came up with yet another add-on: Giving Tuesday.This Tuesday Americans will be encouraged to give to charity a portion of the disposable income they usually throw at Thanksgiving particularly through groups which advise and educate on sustainable giving.  Donating while you spend is an old tradition embedded in many of the world's major religions. If you can treat yourself on Black Friday you can afford to buy a gift for someone less fortunate -- that's an idea with roots in the old Christian and Jewish system of tithing or the Islamic zakat.I was recently told a story about a well-known American dynasty who traditionally raise their children with the following approach to sustainable wealth management and philanthropy: for every $3 pocket money you should save one spend one and give one. It's standard throughout the world to link one's capacity and responsibility for philanthropy directly to one's disposable income.This year however Giving Tuesday is trying to go global. Which is a tough sell given its links to the all-American festival of Thanksgiving. Twenty-first century capitalism crosses borders; patriotism slightly less so. Here in London my friends and I have been bombarded with advertisements for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. (What Amazon can flog in Boston Amazon will flog in Belgravia.) Small Business Saturday has also taken off largely as a social media opportunity for UK politicians to be photographed enthusiastically at small businesses in their constituency. (The basics of local politics also cross borders.) Unmoored from any connection with Thanksgiving it is marked on the first Saturday in December as a build-up to Christmas shopping.  And it's not just the UK that's cashing in this week. Amazon France excitedly informed its customers today: "Les ventes flash Cyber Monday sont là!" In Germany it's "Cyber-Monday-Woche" with appropriate compound nouns.What's missing from this international extension of the Thanksgiving franchise is much of the altruistic spirit that gives an American Thanksgiving its warm and cuddly heart.Millennial Europeans are pretty familiar with the concept of Thanksgiving thanks to the cultural saturation of American sitcoms but older generations see little reason in marking a festival dedicated to the American historical memory. (And why should we? The early history of the modern American nation wasn't exactly marked by intermittent transatlantic friendship parades.) When it comes to the last week of November we do the shopping we do more shopping but we don't waste time focusing on motherhood pecan pie or philanthropy. That could be changing in the UK. Some UK millennials the generation most thoroughly interlinked with American culture online have begun to mark Thanksgiving as an opportunity for a "Friendsgiving."We're a generation which invests social value heavily in our friendship circles and we find returning to our families a bit of a drag at Christmas -- so we're predisposed to fetishize a 'pre-Christmas' turkey alternative with the people who matter most our peers. (Bonus: we've all watched enough "Friends'' reruns that we secretly hope someone will invite Brad Pitt to Thanksgiving.) Even the flaming US cultural wars over Thanksgiving don't seem to have had too much of an impact on the young British Friendsgiving trend. It's harder to get into a fight about the erasure of Native American peoples -- rightly or wrongly -- when you're not actually eating turkey on the site of their removal. So perhaps British millennials too could get on board with the concept of Giving Tuesday. Like their American counterparts young Brits are heavily concerned with social justice organized politically online and keen to demonstrate their moral superiority over their parents. The only problem is that as with voting it can be difficult to get them to put their money where their mouth is.Here's hoping that when next year's Cyber Monday goes international the world's online retailers have gotten smarter about tying their promotions to opportunities to give. (Amazon's online giving scheme has been a good model despite a major blooper.) An international festival of spending without a social purpose would be a poor American gift to the world.,Opinion
James Ball is an award-winning journalist and author who has worked for WikiLeaks The Guardian The Washington Post and BuzzFeed. The opinions in this article belong to the author. (CNN)On Wednesday evening -- just hours before the Thanksgiving holiday -- Facebook issued a statement in which it confessed that it had hired a public relations company to contact the press connecting its critics to the Hungarian financier George Soros.George Soros has become a lightning rod for the far right and for anti-Semites across the world -- and serves as dog-whistle shorthand for such groups. As one of the largest platforms in the world hosting such hate groups Facebook knows this well.As such a deliberate effort to brand its opponents in this way -- as "Soros-funded" -- demonstrates an almost malicious willingness to tap into both those feelings and those groups and setting them against critics of their social network.This is not corporate PR as usual. Even in its statement Facebook referred to its critics in derogatory terms -- as "so-called grassroots networks." By releasing it hours before a US public holiday Facebook has demonstrated its contempt for its critics and its total lack of contrition over its activities. The company it seems is only sorry it got caught.As can be demonstrated by the numerous public inquiries -- whether in Congress the European Parliament or the UK House of Commons to name just a few -- that Facebook is facing the company has some huge issues to tackle to restore the internet and to protect its future.It needs to tackle the hate speech it fuels as well as online misinformation and fake news. It needs to address the use of its network for political dark advertising. It needs to tackle the dwindling attention of its younger users. And it needs to tackle how its WhatsApp service is being used to fuel mob murders in India.None of these problems are easy to solve: they will require significant investment effort and possibly even serious changes to the company's business model -- as well as an acknowledgment that what they've done so far isn't working.Yet Facebook has demonstrated that it's not ready to address any of these problems and has done so in a glaringly public way: it is making no effort to fix something much simpler.Hiring a PR company to smear critics speaks volumes about the culture toward the top of Facebook and about its attitudes to critics -- even as those critics are repeatedly and publicly vindicated.Fixing that toxic and defensive company culture is easy when compared to the other issues facing Facebook. But every part of its response to the situation shows that it has no intention to do so.First Facebook attacked t reporting of The New York Times which broke the story. Then it acknowledged using the PR firm involved but claimed to be shocked and surprised that it had engaged in efforts to smear opposition groups. Then when Facebook hoped no one was looking it acknowledged that it had specifically asked the PR group to do just that.These are not the actions of a company looking to resolve a problem or fix the culture that led to it. They are the actions of a company instead looking to keep on doing what it's always done -- and just sweep the scandal away.If Facebook is to avoid being regulated into oblivion -- if not now then in the middle to long term -- it needs to demonstrate it can be a good corporate citizen especially given its pivotal role in the information ecosystem of nearly two billion users.To do that the company needs to change. Yet it seems to be doing almost everything possible to stay the same to still believe it knows best and critics regulators and politicians are not worthy of its attention.It's a long time since Facebook was a scrappy upstart. It is not a startup or a disruptor any more: it is a huge corporation -- one of America's 10 biggest companies with huge power and commensurate revenues.It doesn't appear to have noticed: with the public contempt the company shows to those who might take it on or urge it to change Facebook might tell itself it is trying not to be dragged down by people who don't understand the future or how things are changing.,Opinion
Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music movies and culture for The New York Times Newsday Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)When we watch movies we're tempted to take what they say in one ear and out the other because we're there to look more than listen.  Screenwriters know this and as with anybody compelled to hold up their end of a conversation they seek ways to attract attention. Their names alone aren't going to do it so they find attention and at times immortality through a line or two that sticks in an audience's collective memory bank. Consider for instance: "Gentlemen you can't fight in here. This is the War Room!" from "Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964). The line is credited to Terry Southern who won literary notoriety for such satiric novels as "The Magic Christian" and "Candy" but whose "War Room" joke I bet is remembered by many more people.William Goldman who died Friday in New York at age 87 also started out as a novelist publishing five novels before he turned 33. But though he went on to publish other books of fiction and nonfiction Goldman will be remembered more for his Oscar-winning screenplays for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and "All the President's Men" (1976). Goldman was a virtuoso of pithy dialogue that flowed with sharp tangy momentum. At its most limber and colorful the repartee in a Goldman script allowed plenty of room for memorable lines to leap happily into spectators' ears and stay there.  When in "Butch Cassidy" Sundance (Robert Redford) confesses that he can't leap into a river from a high cavern because he can't swim Butch (Paul Newman) laughs and says "Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill ya!" (Of course they jump.)  And whatever else you want to say about "Butch/Sundance" (that year's highest-grossing film despite mixed reviews) you have to believe that a writer has to have a pretty good sense of pacing and hearing to leave audiences repeating long afterward the fugitive heroes' bemused query "Who are those guys?" Maybe you had to be there to appreciate the full impact of "Butch/Sundance." But Goldman definitely had enough of a touch to resonate through at least two decades of prolific scripting -- whether they involved adapting his own novels ("Marathon Man" "Magic" "Heat") other people's novels ("Harper" "The Stepford Wives" "Misery" "Absolute Power") original stories either made up ("The Great Waldo Pepper") or real life ("All the President's Men" "Chaplin").  These and many others including several he wasn't even credited for have their fans. But since I have the floor I will declare that "The Princess Bride" Goldman's 1987 adaptation of his 1973 fantasy-quest novel represents his single finest achievement. I don't think I'm alone in falling for "Princess Bride's" combination of winking slapstick high adventure enchanting romance and whimsical invention.  And it doesn't just have memorable lines. Even the way one says the single word "Inconceivable!" (as blurted by Wallace Shawn in the film) can expose a "Princess Bride" devotee. If you look for it there's a video of contemporary Hollywood A-listers from Nicole Kidman Steve Carell Emma Stone to Jake Gyllenhaal Jessica Chastain and Emma Thompson quoting great hunks of dialogue from "Princess Bride." (Says Kidman wistfully: "I just want a man to say 'As you wish' " as Cary Elwes' hero says those words in the film.)  Goldman made such eternal magic look easy. And he insisted it was easy (sort of) saying screenwriting was more of a craft compared with the artistry involved in writing novels or composing poetry. What wasn't easy however was being able to make his professional way through the often-impenetrable thickets of the movie industry. The process of dealing with wave upon wave of producers directors agents stars and other Hollywood field workers led Goldman to some rueful hard-won and caustic conclusions about the film business one of which he famously summed up in "Adventures in the Screen Trade" (1983) one of a handful of wise juicy insider accounts of show business.  "Nobody knows anything" he wrote. "Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what's going to work. Every time out it's a guess and if you're lucky an educated one." To repeat: "Nobody knows anything." As noted earlier the man could come up with a snappy line that lasts a long time.  ,Opinion
Rashad Robinson is president of Color Of Change America's largest online racial justice organization. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)The calls came fast all with the same question: Is it true you are funded by George Soros? I was dismayed. I run a national racial justice organization and a story had just broken that named us in a controversy. The New York Times reported that Facebook had sought to deflect blame for its role in empowering far right hate speech by in fact employing a right-wing media company to spread a soft sanitized version of that same hate speech. And instead of holding Facebook accountable for that these reporters just wanted me to confirm whether Soros was a funder. According to the Times report Facebook had been trying to convince reporters that our campaign to push the social media giant into better behavior was secretly part of a coordinated effort undertaken by organizations funded by Soros. This is a thinly veiled version of a more sinister increasingly pervasive theory: that organizations fighting for social change are secretly controlled by Soros and some master Jewish plot to take over America.White nationalists have been targeting Soros an investor and philanthropist for some time. Knowing that their conspiracy theories are echoing around the right-wing blogosphere is one thing. But hearing that those theories are being advanced by a company with the eyes of over 2 billion users is quite another. While Facebook has denied paying a media company to write news stories or spread information if you trust The New York Times reporting as I do then Facebook allegedly used an outside company to point the finger at Soros. Why? Because the goal of these attacks is the revival of an age-old strategy of using anti-Jewish attacks to discredit all progressive social movements including ours. In some ways the report of Facebook's tactics is the most powerful proof yet that in the three years since Donald Trump announced his candidacy white supremacy views and anti-Jewish conspiracy theories have moved into the mainstream. This fall we saw the inevitable results of their success: violence. It started with a pipe bomb sent by a Trump fanatic to Soros himself and ended with the most deadly assault against Jewish people in American history in Pittsburgh. Yet violence is only the most extreme and obvious effect. If we fail to understand how white nationalist and right-wing attacks on Soros fit together with their perennial attacks on communities of color we are missing their full strategy. We are also missing the threat it poses.The idea that my organization for instance is focused on what Soros is giving us rather than on what conservatives are trying to take away -- our vote our health care our liberty our job protections -- is a laughable distraction. But the idea that my organization is a pawn in someone else's game rather than the self-determined and black-led force that we are is dangerously undermining. That our concerns and strategies are really a front for Soros' concerns and strategies diminishes not only our cause of challenging institutional racism but also our standing and power in society. Soros is far from our only or largest funder. Undermining black people's power in this way benefits white nationalists obviously but it also helps all those organizations whose decisions adversely affect black people but who want to avoid the accountability that our work demands -- organizations like Facebook. It is just as true for all those whose activism and advocacy have been implicated in the attacks on Soros: immigrants Muslims feminists LGBT people Arabs and others. For instance the same right-wing media claims about Soros pulling all the strings were made about women protesting then-nominee Kavanaugh in order to dismiss their concerns without having to address them. And if you think the fear of black people and the fear of Jewish people are not being used in tandem just watch the ad that closed out the election for the National Republican Congressional Committee the campaigning arm of the Republican Party. The ad starts with Colin Kaepernick and ends with George Soros standing over a pile of money. Quite simply white nationalists and some on the right do not want anyone who is not like them to exist in their reality. They especially do not want progressive social movements to become more powerful. The conservative political establishment amplifying anti-Jewish conspiracies to win elections is no surprise -- they have caved in to every opportunistic obsession of the far right. But they still deserve shame for doing so and social media companies like Facebook that shrilly insist on their own independence from that conservative agenda must fully renounce these conspiracies -- not willfully promote them. They need to acknowledge that these anti-Jewish attacks in addition to their immediate threat to Jewish people are an attempt to disempower a much wider set of people whom we all depend on to advance democracy equity and justice in American society.,Opinion

For a brief moment Kennedy's death produced a kind of national unity not seen since World War II opening up political space for the new president Lyndon Johnson to push through watershed civil rights and voting rights legislation in 1964 and 1965.President Kennedy's death on November 22 1963 in Dallas shocked many Americans out of the political stupor of the Eisenhower years a time mythologized by some even today as as a sepia-toned era of economic plenty and cultural innocence. Kennedy's greatest legacy and contemporary tribute remains the fact that during his final months as president he embraced a liberated American future one that is still being debated today but came one step closer to realization through the strength of his leadership.   The advent of the 1960s came at a moment when Cold War liberalism had identified the Soviet Union as America's greatest existential threat. President Kennedy's only inauguration speech bore out this logic; he famously observed that America stood prepared to "pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."  But Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address focused on external threats just as domestic unrest stirred around racial justice and the struggle for black dignity. A televised address almost 2½ years into his tenure would be his finest moment as president. On June 11 1963 against the backdrop of Alabama Gov. George Wallace's infamous threat to stand by the schoolhouse door to prevent the University of Alabama from being racially integrated John Kennedy firmly and eloquently supported black citizenship. Civil rights demonstrations and protests in Birmingham Alabama and cities across the nation inspired Kennedy to deliver the speech. The President previously best known for his cool demeanor and piercing intellect gave a rousing defense of racial justice that evening that characterized following the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. the civil rights movement as a moral imperative. "A great change is at hand and our task our obligation is to make that revolution that change peaceful and constructive for all" Kennedy said. "Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence" he warned. "Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality." Kennedy's assassination ended his burgeoning efforts on civil rights which were buoyed by the work of millions of ordinary Americans to create a political consensus that recognized black citizenship and racial justice as the key to the nation's future. Ironically his sudden death at the hand of an assassin's bullet set the stage for historic legislation that would expand American democracy -- extending the franchise and civil rights of people of color -- even as it revealed new depths of division along racial cultural and political divides.In a sense America came undone after the Kennedy assassination and remade itself by accepting some hard truths about its history.  The roughest parts of that history could be seen in proliferating civil disorders that critics labeled riots and social justice advocates called rebellions. By decade's end the forward-looking handsome and ambitious young president had been replaced improbably by the man he defeated in 1960 -- Eisenhower's vice president Richard Nixon.  Nixon won victory on a promise to turn back the clock to a more peaceful domestic era one ruled by law and order where average Americans felt safe from the anxiety of social unrest. Nixon staked his entire presidency on the reversal of Kennedy's affirmation that racial justice could not be stopped by police power.Nixon's rewriting of history helped to define the 1970s the decade after Kennedy's assassination as did the roiling social protests by blacks women Native Americans Latinos Asian-Americans gays and lesbians and poor people.  Debates over the Vietnam War and poverty exploded into what seemed like open warfare between young baby boomers who craved a new world and an older generation many battle-scarred by the Second World War who prized a tenuous domestic peace over justice for groups who had been left out of Eisenhower-era America's prosperity.Kennedy's youthful image alongside that of first lady Jacqueline Kennedy is a kind of Rorschach test for our time. What feelings do images of the young president and the subsequent assassination evoke? For some it's a deep loss of innocence. For others Kennedy represents the unfinished promise of our democratic experiment. Looking in retrospect we can see that Kennedy transitioned to power during an era of enormous domestic and global change where America's hidden face of racial segregation poverty and violence became clear for all the world to see.  America's Janus-faced response found one portion of the country heeding King's call to build a "beloved community" and finding strength in the country's diversity. Another portion resisted calls for change by turning inward and embracing a past that refused to come to terms with a national history of inequality.  Fifty-five years after Kennedy's assassination America is once again coming undone and remaking itself before our very eyes.  President Donald Trump's pledge to "Make America Great Again" drew inspiration from Nixon's playbook framing America's present as a tragic departure from a glorious past. Where President Kennedy embraced America's multiracial and multicultural makeup as offering the entire nation a better future Trump's rhetoric remains mired in a past that upon closer inspection excluded millions of Americans from dreams of freedom equality and justice.  Kennedy's vision which would be institutionalized through much of the legislation enacted under Lyndon Johnson's Great Society reverberates through contemporary debates about the future of American democracy. This year commemorations of the Kennedy assassination fall on Thanksgiving.  Kennedy's death is still marked as the tragic end of the bucolic postwar American dream. This is both unfortunate and shortsighted. Kennedy presided over a transformational era in American politics a moment of national reckoning on issues of race democracy and citizenship. Rather than viewing Kennedy's death as the end of an era we should remember it as the start of America's Second Reconstruction a period that would usher in new freedoms for a wide spectrum of historically marginalized citizens. Kennedy challenged Americans to brave new domestic and global frontiers without fear. On this score he led by example and in doing so left us with enduring hope that we could be as courageous and forward-looking in our time as he was in his.,Opinion
Salvador Gomez Colon 16 lives in San Juan Puerto Rico and is a delegate to The International Congress of Youth Voices. He is the creator of Light and Hope for Puerto Rico. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Over a year ago now Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico ripping away homes and leaving residents with little food water and power. As youth enduring this disaster my friends and I were living a new life that no one prepared us for: one of scarcity. No one had trained us to be resilient or have grit. I saw how fear anger and sadness began to take over our lives.After the hurricane Puerto Rico's public schools were closed for three to six months and some never reopened. When my teachers resumed their modified curriculums a month after the hurricane we were shaken and distracted unable to learn. Graduating seniors worried about not being able to submit their college applications on time while us underclassmen worried about our futures being derailed. All clubs and sports were canceled for weeks taking away the things that provided us with joy and inspiration. School became hard but it was hard for all the wrong reasons.Perhaps the worst of it all was that the entire Island was completely destroyed and yet those with power spent their time criticizing each other's efforts instead of actively finding ways to improve their own to help the millions of suffering people. But I had hope then — and still do today — that we have the ability to create change. With small actions we can inspire and help others begin the healing process. With this mindset I took matters into my own hands creating Light and Hope for Puerto Rico an initiative to purchase and distribute solar lamps and hand-powered washing machines to Puerto Rico's most heavily affected communities. Light and Hope raised over $150000 and distributed over 5500 lamps and 1500 washing machines across 17 of the hardest-hit municipalities across the island.As I visited different towns in my quest to help others I witnessed the youth population just trying to make it. In Loiza a town on the northeastern coast I encountered a young high school student standing on her lime-green and sky-blue painted porch. As I looked more closely I was immediately drawn to what she was holding in her hand: a book — Homer's Iliad. She told me that she loved reading so she decided to take advantage of the sunlight. When I offered her a solar-powered lamp she was jubilant knowing that she would finally be able to read at night. But others were losing their way. Some young people were no longer motivated to pursue higher education or even go back to school. Some wet their pants every time they heard rain or wind re-living those frightening moments of September 20 2017. I believe many of us were traumatized. It continues to shock me that global disaster response and relief efforts often lack a response to youth-related issues particularly related to education and trauma. It seems like people were focused on the lack of electric power but many forgot the power of emotional health. The world is in desperate need of programs that teach natural disaster preparation and resiliency. I want my peers to realize that even though we can't control natural disasters we can definitely control our response. We must adapt to the fact that natural disasters are not the end of life especially on a planet where they are increasingly more common. If there's anything that my post-Maria life has taught me it's that young people can do anything. Maria has shown me that resilience is the antidote to hopelessness despair and pessimism. Even in the face of total devastation I've seen many youth find immense courage from the deepest parts of their hearts and minds. Age doesn't define our maturity and it should not define our responsibility our character or our potential to positively impact our communities. To support Puerto Rico and help others prepare recover and rebuild youth must not be spectators of problems but facilitators of solutions.,Opinion

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)This year will be the year of the tikka masala turkey. I have planned it out procured the special spices found the perfectly sized bird and amassed large quantities of tenderizing ginger and garlic. My goal is simple: a perfectly cooked bird that has never known the meaning of bland or dry and against whose briny interiors taunts of tastelessness slide away. I plan this sort of route nearly every Thanksgiving. Each time I am convinced that a new strategy (say soaking in vinegar) a novel tactic (removing the skin) a rejuvenated arsenal of spices (you've never seen these quantities of red chili powder) will enable my victory against the turkey -- producing the delectable bird of my Thanksgiving dreams. This proposition in my spice-soused imagination is perennially irresistible. Why not marry the best of America with the best of my native homeland Pakistan? It is food as metaphor food as the basis for a deeply felt union. I believe this and so I try and keep trying.My quest has a long and storied history. It began almost two decades ago when I bought my first turkey at my first Thanksgiving. A teenage bride just arrived in Nashville (another story for another time) I was determined to participate in this most American of traditions with full fervor. My then-mother-in-law tried to tell me the turkey required protracted defrosting at least a day before it could be cooked. I didn't like advice then (or now) and so I ignored her. That first turkey was not only bland and dry after it was cooked it was not actually cooked until several days after Thanksgiving. All I had to show that day of gratitude was a rock solid frozen bird sitting sadly in my small apartment sink.I did not give up. A few Thanksgivings later goaded by the cheery encouragements of supermarket specials (I am inordinately excited by these) I decided to try again. I wanted to learn from my failures so I decided the whole bird was a bit too much for the still-tiny apartment kitchen. Chastened by experience I bought turkey breasts instead of the whole turkey. But because they are cheap and because I love making large meals I bought six. These I decided I would bake with an assortment of potatoes and onions and root vegetables. It could not go wrong I assured myself. I added cumin coriander nutmeg and turmeric. A long half a day later the thing was done. It was a qualified victory. The spices seemed to have slipped off the turkey breasts and rolled down into the vegetables making them nearly deadly. The turkey breasts tasted like turkey breasts though which is to say like nothing at all. I never admit defeat right away and I didn't then. Instead I went about offering the five remaining ones to various neighbors. I had only one taker a British lady who was in the country for not very long. I made up a heaping plate and dropped it off at her apartment excited to draw her into the festivities of a truly American celebration. I never heard from her again.In ensuing years I have reflected on my efforts to spice up the turkey and remained undaunted by those who scoff at them. As a South Asian-American used to chickens that are (at least in Pakistan) not hormonally enhanced the sheer size of the turkey is enthralling as is the idea of transforming it into a spicy and delectable dish. When a relatively small chicken doused or baked or grilled in tikka masala tastes so good imagine a large turkey. Fueled by the fervor of this possibility I tend to ignore logistical challenges. In South Asian cooking spices are added to hot oil and permitted to sweat before the addition of any meat. This presents a challenge where the turkey is concerned -- how do you roll around a bird so large in sweating spices and what tremendously sized pot set over a gargantuan burner would make this possible? Worn out by November wars there have been years in which I have tried to forget about conquering the turkey been close to admitting defeat against its gamey inflections its haughty perseverance against flavor. But this year I will be taking another shot at tikka masala turkey. I have found a new and very hard-to-find brand of particularly potent spice mix and figured out how I can brine the bird in the concoction for days. I've begun the process as I steadily envision the cumin and the coriander the chili powder and the ginger seeping deep into the bird birthing juicy spicy flavor from the inside out. I just know that I will produce the perfect turkey this year finally wedding South Asian culinary zest with American tradition. ,Opinion
Diana Butler Bass (@dianabutlerbass) holds a Ph.D. in religious studies from Duke University and is the author of 10 books on American religion and culture including "Grateful: The Transformative Power of Giving Thanks" (HarperOne 2018). The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Holidays often provoke stress especially in families strained by emotional tensions economic challenges or grief.  After the 2016 election however that stress metastasized into a full-on cultural disorder:  American Thanksgiving Anxiety.Although I'm pretty sure I'm the first to name it there is real evidence of such a disorder.  Social scientists Keith Chen and Ryne Rohla discovered that Americans significantly shortened Thanksgiving dinners in recent years especially when spending the holiday with relatives of the opposite political party.  Democrats celebrating Thanksgiving in Republican areas spent 20-40 minutes less time over the meal; Republicans visiting Democratic relations reduced holiday visits by 50-70 minutes.  Thanksgiving has become polarized. We only want to feast with our own tribe.In the last year while speaking about my book "Grateful" I've had conversations across the country about gratefulness especially about the power of giving thanks to renew a divided country. "We can celebrate together" I remind listeners "food the bounty of the earth the gifts of life and work the pleasure of relationships ... and the call to serve others as we have been served."   Audiences cheer this vision.  After each speech however at least one person has stood up launched into a tale of a relative ruining Thanksgiving by pontificating on politics and asked: "What can I do about Thanksgiving dinner?" With this question dozens nod their heads in recognition clearly worried about their own divided families at Thanksgiving. This worried the researchers. "Some people don't see losing dinner with relatives as a particularly large cost" commented Rohla. "I've talked to people who are 'Well so what?' Personally I think it is concerning. To me it's a symptom of a broader decline in the social fabric of the United States."So what can we do about Thanksgiving dinner?First if it is too hard to spend Thanksgiving with your MAGA-cap-wearing uncle or your sister in her "She Persisted" T-shirt don't.  But if you opt out be sure you don't mope at home over a frozen meal watching football. Instead volunteer.  Serve dinner at a homeless shelter.  Attend a religious service.  Visit a cancer ward or a senior center.  Invite international students to your house and make them a Thanksgiving meal.  Do something on Thanksgiving that strengthens ties between people even if it is hard to do with your own relatives.  Reaching out to strangers can be the first step toward reaching out again to your own kin. Second if you must spend the holiday with a politically divided family you can do some things to lessen anxiety whether you are the host or a guest. If you are the host much of what happens at the dinner depends on what you do to make your guests -- all your guests -- feel safe and valued.  Don't assume people will get along.  Even if they don't fight about Donald Trump they may well fight about other things that used to be less controversial -- like football or the weather.  Be proactive about potential conflicts.  Provide "Rules for a Nonpartisan Thanksgiving" at each seat.  Make them funny: no throwing food; no fights over dark or light meat or jellied versus whole-berry cranberry sauce; no flipping between FOX and MSNBC during dinner.  Hosts can also encourage meaningful talk in ways that respect others.  Have guests write down what they are grateful for put the slips in a jar and then have people draw papers and read the thanks of others out loud.  Offer a "menu" of conversation starters.  Ask each person to share a memory of a favorite Thanksgiving.  Good memories remind people of meaningful family moments and may put present tensions in a broader context.  If you are brave have your guests address politics directly.  Ask those gathered when they've last had a meal with someone of a different political party or felt truly grateful for different opinions and perspectives.  If you are a Republican have a story ready from your own life about what you appreciate and what you've learned from your Democratic relatives (and the opposite for those of you who are Democrats).  If you are a guest remember that you are responsible for your own behavior.  If you have a good relationship with the host call in advance and let him or her know you are feeling anxious about the visit. Ask your mother to say something to Uncle Joe before dinner -- to go easy on politics to keep the conversation away from divisive topics to remember that kindness is an important part of being family.  Prepare strategies for maintaining your cool. Have a "text-a-friend" ready.  Use bathroom breaks tactically.  Deflect controversy with jokes.  Take a long walk after dinner. Put your therapist on speed-dial.  Bring the greatest dessert ever as a gift; if you contribute good food it is harder for people to get mad at you.  If you decide to engage a political concern do so with both facts and humor. Above all have appropriate expectations. You aren't going to convert anybody over Thanksgiving dinner but you might start a new conversation with an estranged relative that could continue into the future.  Thanksgiving is the only holiday Americans have specifically to celebrate gratitude to recognize the bounties of creation and community upon which we all depend.  And as with so many other aspects of American society right now we have work to do.  The table needs to be reset.  This Thanksgiving remember that our lives are a gift that all we have and all that sustains us are gifts and that we can choose -- even around the most awkward holiday table -- to be thankful with and for each other.  ,Opinion

(CNN)According to a recent paper the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane.  A swarm of nearly 100 stars accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there's nothing we can do to stop it; in fact the vanguard is already upon us.  This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie starring The Rock and Chris Pratt or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.Except this is for real. But is it a danger?  Well actually no. Not at all. But it's potentially incredibly fascinating with lots of interesting scientific interconnections. So what is really going on?The story starts last April when the Gaia satellite announced the locations and trajectories of 2 billion stars in the vicinity of the Milky Way surrounding our sun. They released the data to the public.Scientists were then able to look at the data set to see if they could spot anything peculiar.  In galaxies like the Milky Way the most common behavior is that the stars orbit the center of the galaxy in a manner broadly similar to the planets orbiting our sun.  However there are some stars that exhibit unusual motion.  About a year ago astronomers identified some "stellar streams" passing through our celestial neighborhood.  One of them called S1 (for stream 1) consists of nearly 100 stars of similar age and composition orbiting the Milky Way in a direction exactly opposite that of normal stars.  It's kind of like a handful of cars driving the wrong way down the highway except with a much greater distance between them and with no likelihood of a collision.  These stars are spread out over a few thousand light years and they will pass through the solar system's neighborhood over the course of a few million years.Astronomers identified S1 as being part of the remnants of a dwarf galaxy that collided with the Milky Way and was consumed in an epic episode of cosmic cannibalism.  Dwarf galaxies are very small typically about 1% the mass of the Milky Way.  They can orbit larger galaxies and collide with the bigger galaxy adding their mass to the parent.  This is what appears to have happened in the case of S1 although the process has taken probably a billion years.Dwarf galaxies often have a disproportionately large fraction of dark matter.  Dark matter is a hypothetical and still-undiscovered form of matter that interacts only gravitationally.  Scientists have proposed its existence to explain many astronomical mysteries for example the observation that most galaxies rotate faster than can be explained by the known laws of physics and the stars and gas of which they are composed.  While dark matter has not yet been observed hypothesizing its existence is the simplest and most economical explanation for myriad astronomical mysteries.  Averaged over the entire universe dark matter is thought to be five times more prevalent than the ordinary mass of stars and gas and planets.In dwarf galaxies the fraction of dark matter is often higher.  In Fornax a well-studied dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way researchers estimate that the dark matter is between 10 and 100 times greater than the mass found in its stars.If that number holds for S1 the dark matter of the S1 stream is passing through the Earth at a much higher velocity than the more ordinary dark matter that orbits the Milky Way -- about twice as fast.  It is thought that S1 dark matter is flying through the solar system at a speed of about 550 km/s or about 1.2 million mph.  While these numbers are impressive they are misleading.  Dark matter if it exists is extremely diffuse and it will have no discernible effect on the solar system.Because dark matter hasn't been observed yet these velocity numbers are speculative although they are strongly supported by a very large body of evidence.  However the prospect of high velocity dark matter flying through the Earth has suggested an opportunity to detect it.In a paper in the prestigious journal Physical Review D researcher Ciaran O'Hare and his collaborators calculated the possibilities of discovering dark matter using both existing and proposed dark matter detectors.  They considered two varieties of dark matter particles: a very heavy kind called a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) and a very light kind called an axion.  Because the ultimate nature of dark matter is not known it is important to be open to all possibilities.  They found that the detectors they evaluated could find WIMPs for certain ranges of the particle mass.  However when they looked at the axion possibility it appeared the prospects were even better.  Because of its light mass and the manner in which an axion would interact with the detector the apparatus simply has a better chance of seeing the axion.  (If axions exist of course.)Experiments with names like ADMX MADMAX and ABRACADABRA are able or will be able to search for the signatures of dark matter proposed in the recent paper.  They consist of technologies that are designed to interact with axions in a strong magnetic field and convert them to ordinary microwaves or radio waves that can be easily detected.  It's important to remember that the S1 stream poses no credible threat to the Earth and humanity.  There is no need for an action hero to save us.  However the synergy of science is staggering.  A careful catalog of nearby stars has opened the prospect of a better possibility of finding and identifying dark matter which is one of the great unanswered mysteries of modern physics.  It's an amazing time we live in in which we can study such things.  I'm excited.,Opinion
Brad Meltzer's thrillers including his newest "The Escape Artist" regularly land at the #1 spot on the bestseller list and he is also the author of the "Ordinary People Change the World" series. "I am Neil Armstrong" the latest in the series will be published September 11. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. (CNN)Neil Armstrong is making news again. Some might think it's because of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the moon landing or the new Ryan Gosling film "First Man" or especially the fact that Donald Trump is publicly complaining about said movie and whether or not the American flag has enough screen time. But in my mind the real reason Neil Armstrong is back is because we need him. More than ever. For years in our "I Am" book series I've studied and written about American heroes. If there's one thing I've learned it's this: You don't get the heroes you want; you get the heroes you need. So look around -- and look especially at Neil Armstrong's sudden resurgence. Certainly his greatest accomplishment was being the first person to walk on the moon. But in 2018 what's equally important are the lessons he gave us throughout his journey.Lesson #1 -- Humility mattersWhenever Armstrong talked about flying an aircraft or a spacecraft he used the term "we" -- not "I." He knew that every milestone he achieved required the help of so many others -- from scientists and engineers to welders and mathematicians to the tailors who sewed the spacesuits to all the astronauts from previous missions.When Apollo 11 was finally ready he said to the flight director "Please tell everyone who worked on this that this is their launch. Tell them they'll be riding with us all the way."Remember when our leaders used the term "we" rather than "I?"It was the same after he became famous. With his legendary moonwalk Armstrong became the most famous person in the world. But even then he never bragged never sold out and never put his face on T-shirts or opened a fast food joint with his name on it. He was humble.Remember when humility was an American virtue? Our leaders have lost this idea. We need to get it back. It's the only way we'll take off. Indeed Armstrong's sense of humility is why I decided to write "I am Neil Armstrong." I wanted to show my kids that Instagram fame isn't nearly as impressive as understated modesty.So how does that prove Armstrong is the hero we need today? Back during the 2016 election as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were bashing each other on a daily basis something surprising happened with the sales of our "I Am" books. Three books in particular started taking off: "I am George Washington" "I am Rosa Parks" and "I am Martin Luther King Jr." Parents and grandparents were tired of turning on the TV and seeing politicians. What they wanted to show their kids were leaders. How do I know? In twenty years as an author I've never sold out a book at Amazon. With the 2016 election Amazon was sold out of "I am Martin Luther King Jr." for nearly a month. For a full year after sales of all the books from George Washington to Rosa Parks to Abraham Lincoln skyrocketed.Throughout history heroes appear when there's a hunger. Right now whatever your political side America is starving for heroes. Especially humble ones.Lesson #2 -- Hard work mattersWhen Neil Armstrong was eight years old his goal was to climb a silver maple tree -- the biggest one in his backyard. It seemed impossible to young Neil. The tree was so big and he was small. How did he do it? He needed to be brave (though as a kid he was afraid of Santa Claus). He needed to be smart (in first grade he read more than 100 books). And he needed to be patient (he remained calm even when his frustrated brother kicked the table during Monopoly).But in order for Neil to get to the top of the tree he had to take that first step. To him climbing the tree was like a puzzle. He needed to pick the right branches in the right order. But on that day he was finally climbing the tree he grabbed a dead branch. The branch snapped and young Neil fell fifteen feet landing flat on his back.His sister came running. The wind was knocked out of him but he was okay. Still the most important thing young Neil did?He got back up again.Even as a child Armstrong knew success takes hard work. At ten years old he mowed grass at a cemetery for ten cents an hour. Then he worked at a bakery. With the money he earned he saved up for what he loved most: airplanes.First he collected toy planes. Then he saved for a flying license. Eventually he got his real pilot's license before he got his driver's license. From there he moved up to be a military pilot then a test pilot then of course to be an astronaut each step vital to helping him climb to the top.Today we love to tell the story of Neil Armstrong taking that giant leap for all mankind. But the only reason he got to take that leap is because of the thousands of smaller steps that came before it.Lesson 3 -- Instead of being loud be calmIn March of 1966 Neil Armstrong's first spaceflight was on the Gemini VIII. The goal was to fly alongside and dock with another spacecraft so they were both linked together. It was the first time two spacecraft ever connected in space. When they docked everyone started celebrating. But then suddenly there was a short circuit in one of their thrusters. The spacecraft became undocked and spun out of control.Even in this chaos Armstrong stayed perfectly calm. He kept his eyes on the controls firing a different thruster to stop their spin. Right there he learned another vital lesson: Nothing in space is easy.He saw that firsthand during his most famous moon landing. As the Lunar Module (Eagle) was headed to the moon's surface landing was challenging. Their radar and instruments weren't very accurate. They couldn't even tell how far they were from the moon's surface. Armstrong had to use a stopwatch and quick math to figure it out.Oh and did I mention they weren't close to NASA's planned landing spot? On top of all that the ground wasn't smooth. The moon rocks were as big as cars.Armstrong never panicked -- even when they had less than a minute of fuel left.Again Armstrong made it work.Today whether it's on Twitter or anywhere else we value those who are the loudest -- those who are best at getting noticed. But let's never forget -- and let's never stop teaching our kids -- that it's quite often the calm and quiet ones the hardest working ones and yes the most humble ones who offer America far more valuable lessons.,Opinion
Abigail McElroy is a senior at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford Pennsylvania. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)I am not a piece of tape. This particular metaphor was a favorite of Amnion Pregnancy Center a crisis pregnancy center (or faux abortion clinic) that visited my health class sophomore year to talk about "healthy relationships." Even though more and more studies have shown that abstinence-only sex education impacts students negatively neither reducing teen pregnancy nor the transmission of STDs abstinence-only organizations still play an active role in sex education in my home state of Pennsylvania and across the United States.Recently many have resorted to scare tactics to convey their one main point: No one will love you if you have sex before marriage. They use disturbing metaphors to relay this frightening idea including comparing young women who have premarital sex to tape that has lost its critical feature -- its stickiness. When the Amnion representatives visited my school they went even further. They spent over an hour telling us that having sex would ruin us for our future spouses and warning us against the "steep slope of arousal." Because didn't you hear hand-holding and kissing are simply stepping stones to sex and we all but lack self-control.After Amnion's degrading presentation I contacted my high-school principal with my concerns about the quality of information and legitimacy of the organization but Amnion returned the next year. So I went one step further and attended the monthly school board meeting. During the open-mic section of the board's August meeting I got up to speak. I started by emphasizing the positive aspects of my school's sex education curriculum. While Pennsylvania standards only require that students learn about HIV STDs and abstinence my health class was relatively comprehensive including information about contraceptives LGBT terminology and drugs and alcohol. Next I highlighted how Amnion's presentation directly contradicted the choice-based curriculum my school had built. Amnion is one of thousands of crisis pregnancy centers in the United States or pro-life nonprofits that often pose as abortion clinics or licensed medical facilities with the active goal of stopping women from getting abortions. Its presentation preached that we are out of control and that abstinence is the only way to guarantee happily married lives. In short their organization seeks to manipulate women out of their right to choose.And Amnion's absurd claim that premarital sex makes people less able to form meaningful relationships poses real harm to all students especially those who have been victims of sexual assault. Not only did these students experience trauma but Amnion's premise asserts that their assaulters robbed their future spouses of intimacy and connection. By allowing Amnion to present year after year my school supported a group that put its religious beliefs above our right to complete information. Though Amnion tried to defend the program saying it was both "secular" and "factual" my school district chose to listen to me instead. Instead of shrugging off my concerns the board investigated and sought to resolve the problem both evaluating why it had happened in the first place and why it couldn't be allowed to continue. In the end the superintendent Lisa Palmer announced that Amnion would be banned from presenting in health class. In an email to the district's parents she wrote "Moving forward core sexual education topics will be covered by our own Wallingford-Swarthmore teachers not outside presenters. This will allow us to more closely control the information presented again with our goal of presenting factual balanced information that empowers our students to make healthy choices."But this is only the beginning. While students at my high school are now free from Amnion's fear-based presentations Amnion also speaks at 25 other area schools and it is just one of many crisis pregnancy centers in Pennsylvania. I am reaching out to friends across the state to expand my model of speaking at school board meetings with the goal of removing Amnion and similar crisis pregnancy centers from public high schools. I'm also leading a letter-writing campaign encouraging my state legislature to pass a bill mandating medically accurate sex education in all public schools. These changes would ensure that teenagers know that healthy relationships are built on communication and consent choice and confidence -- not fear. But this battle is about more than just high school sex education. Over the past month I've discovered that my voice will be heard if and when I raise it.  As the school year begins we as students need to remember that we all have voices. We need to speak to our partners and communicate well. We need to speak to our teachers and advocate for our needs. None of us are tape but we do have extraordinary power to bring people together.,Opinion
This piece is the third part of a CNN Opinion series "What it's like to be me" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. E. Wesley Ely is a physician and the Grant. W. Liddle Professor of Medicine and Critical Care at Vanderbilt University Tennessee Valley VA GRECC and the founder of the Vanderbilt ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group. The views expressed here are solely his. (CNN)"But can't you help me die Doc?" My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed gasping staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways despite our best treatments. As a newly minted doctor years ago my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients' care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician including of course what they tell me in the silences.  I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  "I want euthanasia. I'm going to die soon so what's the point of living longer? I'm just wasted space." I felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.  I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father an engineer had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days we'd walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn't pay anything to Mom who didn't make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store. While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people science and the arts. To me that meant medicine. I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician one has constantly to seek truth about the patient's diagnosis the best treatment and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn't change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: "Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right." Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person's life has value beyond measure.I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn't kill another person just because he or she wanted me to but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul's request to die.'Just don't abandon me'My response came in parts over my days with him.  First I explained that as his physician I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected but I would never intentionally harm him. "Paul our covenant includes my limiting your suffering" I said.  "You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress but we won't deliberately end your life." With our eyes locked Paul gave his instruction: "Just don't abandon me."  And we sat there as partners.As a physician there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping.  Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms but it wasn't enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art music spirituality pets sunshine — that might help him.   'He who has a "why" to live can bear almost any "how"' "I want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for 'Lord of the Rings'?"  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  "I love music. It's always been a motivator but now ... I don't know." He shifted in his bed. "My goals are gone."Nietzsche's words came to my mind "He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how.'" Viktor Frankl as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz used Nietzsche's quote four times in his crucial analysis "Man's Search for Meaning." I think this book should be required reading for medical students.As with many patients Paul's story needed unpacking. "Paul what did you do in life?" He smiled and shrugged. "I'm a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know 'The quality of mercy is not strained.'  I've been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn't understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It's better as a natural infusion one person to another." I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director helping her cue actors.  As we talked I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead and more than once I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking and it was essential.The quality of mercyThat night I asked Christine a nurse who loves theater to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven too. "I think I helped Christine" Paul said the next day. "My own illness made me forget that one of my 'things' is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it." He paused his thoughts far away.It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  "Paul you've asked for euthanasia and you brought up Portia's line from 'Merchant of Venice' about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?"  He nodded and closed his eyes."We all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don't think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful but it would in every sense of the word be 'strained.' It would be a forced and unnatural 'false' mercy.  Whenever possible mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don't want to abandon those key elements in serving you."His eyes opened wide. "Doc talking with you and Christine about life's best and worst times has helped."  He took a deep breath and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  "Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she's coming back tonight and that means the world to me."  Then unwittingly Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: "When we met I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I'm not a believer like others but I guess I remembered the 'why' to live." Short of a war zone there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their "why" even if just for an hour or a day.  'I'm glad I didn't miss this time'I see many paths toward survival in the ICU and for non-survivors myriad paths toward death: sudden prolonged stuttering reluctant stoical -- and these paths are dynamic not static.It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain. Lack of control is what bothers people the most and it drives most requests for euthanasia which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician I find this is a very important "teachable moment" for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind and I recalled them for Paul: "Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin." He nodded in agreement.Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of 'cure' when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.And alongside the patient of course sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately it would for me create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are. Obviously the approach I took with Paul won't be an answer for everyone yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul's story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients and I hope my colleagues do the same. We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible.  What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression but a person's sense of insignificance and hopelessness which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact the last thing he said to me between gasps was: "I'm glad I didn't miss this time. I never saw it coming Doc. ... In losing my breath I gained it." Note: The patient's name and age have been changed for privacy.  These conversations reproduce Paul's words as accurately as possible from the author's memory.,Opinion
 (CNN)Erin Olivera didn't know where to turn.It was 2012 and her 1-year-old son Lucian had suddenly become paralyzed from the waist down. While he was receiving excellent medical care from his doctors in California she and her husband longed for the emotional support and guidance that could only come from the parents of a child like Lucian.But that was the problem. Lucian was one of the first children in the United States to be diagnosed with a paralyzing disease called acute flaccid myelitis or AFM.Even on Facebook his mother couldn't find kindred souls.Then one day a random class assignment gave Olivera a solution that proves that history sometimes repeats itself.Olivera was in her last semester of nursing school and she was assigned to visit a support group that had meaning for her life. She chose a support group for polio survivors since her son's disease and polio are similar.The members of that support group -- elderly people who had suffered a disease long since eradicated in the United States -- would change her life forever.AFM and polio: eerie similaritiesIn the late 1940s and early 1950s polio crippled more than 35000 people a year on average making it one of the most feared diseases of the 20th century according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Polio and AFM are eerily similar in ways: Experts believe that both are caused by the same family of viruses. The patients mainly children start out with what looks like a cold or the flu and then paralysis strikes.Since 2014 there have been 440 cases of AFM in the United States in 46 states according to the CDC. The average age of patients this year is 5 years old.Thanks to the polio vaccine the US has been polio free since 1979 according to the CDC.But there is no cure or vaccine for AFM and health care practitioners have had to figure out on their own the best ways to care for these children.Some have harkened back to the polio era to help their patients. Melissa Murray a physical therapist in Oregon scoured old medical journal articles about polio to figure out what exercises to give her patient Bailey Sheehan who was diagnosed with AFM in 2014 at the age 7. Her entire right side was paralyzed."I was unsure and a little nervous because I wanted to help but this was such uncharted territory" Murray said. "I never thought I'd be going back in time to read about polio."Bailey now 11 suffers frequent headaches and is weak in her right arm but she is able to walk -- something her mother credits to Murray's historical research."Melissa and her resourcefulness -- I believe that's 100 percent why Bailey is walking again" Mikell Sheehan said.Looking back in time to gain medical wisdom from an earlier disease as Murray and others have done with AFM is "extraordinary" according to David Oshinsky a professor of history at New York University and author of "Polio: An American Story" which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 2006."To me that's amazing. I've never seen a connection like that" he said. Lessons from the pastWhen Olivera brought her son to the Post Polio Members Support Group meeting at the Thousand Oaks community center she at first thought maybe she'd made a mistake. These people were more than a half-century older than her son -- could they really help?  Then she saw one of the polio survivors who sat in a motorized wheelchair pick her leg up by grabbing the skin on the top of her thigh much like one might pick up a puppy by the scruff of its neck.It was a very specific movement that was familiar to Olivera because that's how Lucian moved his leg too.She knew she was in the right place.So did the polio survivors."Seeing the boy brought back memories for us. It was like déjà vu" said Sherrill Boyd 79 who contracted polio when she was 9.The survivors' advice came almost immediately some of it quite by accident. When Lucian grabbed his thigh and put his leg up on a table Olivera who went to etiquette school as a girl winced. The polio survivors laughed."They said 'He's stretching his leg. We do that too! It's good!'" Olivera remembers. "So now I say -- break all the etiquette rules!"As Norma Puch watched Lucian and heard his story she was reminded of her own story. Both she and Lucian got sick when they were very young -- Puch was 18 months old and Lucian was 11 months old. Like Lucian she wears a brace on her left leg from ankle to hip.Seeing him made her remember a painful incident when she was a young woman working as a receptionist at a Los Angeles construction company. One day she stepped outside to take a break. She was wearing a classic '70s miniskirt."Hey cover that thing up" a passerby yelled.He was referring to her leg brace."I was so mad - I thought what an idiot!" remembers Puch who's now 65. "I should be ashamed because I have this metal thing on my leg?"She told Olivera not to listen to the haters and to think of Lucian as just like any other child."When I was a girl I didn't think of myself as different or compromised even though I couldn't walk as fast as other children" Puch said.That advice made Olivera realize she and her husband needed to treat Lucian just like his three older siblings."Up until that point we had him in a bubble. We would always take turns holding him or he was always right next to us. But that wasn't going to help him at all" she remembers. "After the meeting my husband and I talked and we decided we were not going to raise Lucian to be this disability. We were going to raise Lucian to live with a disability."Today at age 7 Lucian is a happy little boy with no signs of self-pity. He walks with his brace and a walker or scoots on the floor. He does chores like his brothers and sister but in a modified way -- for example to clean up his room he takes toys off the floor and puts them in a bag attached to his walker and then places them back on the shelf.Not wanting to lose the wisdom of the older generation Olivera arranged for Kurt Sipolski a polio survivor who wrote a memoir "Too Early for Flowers" to be on the board of a group she created for parents of children with AFM. Sipolski regularly dispenses advice to this new generation of parents whose children live with paralysis.After the meeting one of the polio survivors knit Lucian a pair of thick woolen socks since people with paralysis often have cold feet.The socks have become a keepsake for Olivera from a day that changed her life."That meeting reassured me and gave me such insight" she said. "They all said polio didn't limit their success. They had careers. They had families. They made me see that Lucian will do those things too.",Health
 (CNN)In one day everything changed. One day she could walk down the street like anyone else. People still stared and often judged but in their own minds -- not out loud. But before she knew it she was dodging abuse and stones thrown at her by strangers as well as familiar faces."Since the announcement was made things got worse" said the 23-year-old trans woman from Tanzania who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for her safety.She was called derogatory names for being trans and one night was slapped by two men who had been following her but she managed to run home fast enough to prevent further abuse she says."The feeling is unexplainable" she said. She began questioning the world her life and who she was. "You start thinking 'what species am I? Where do I belong?' "The announcement that she says changed her life was made by powerful politician Paul Makonda regional governor of Dar es Salaam Tanzania's largest city. At the end of October he vowed to set up a task force to round up and arrest people suspected of being gay.She first identified as a trans woman in 2016 having previously considered herself to be a gay man. "It took courage" she said. "Tanzania is a very religious country."Although she was "very intelligent" about coming out and about going only to known LGBT-friendly settings she now feels that things have taken several steps back.Four weeks ago she fled her home in Dar es Salaam to go to Kenya's capital Nairobi with the help of Kenya-based nongovernmental organization Jinsiangu which is supported by the International AIDS Alliance and its Rapid Response Fund. "It was so bad I had go" she said. The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi."I'm free here" she said.'If you know any gays report them to me'Makonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country forcing many into hiding.Stating that his phone number is widely known "I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays report them to me" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.People already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex a holdover from colonial-era laws mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.Under the administration of President John Magufuli rights groups believe the situation has gotten worse with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.But the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.After intense international pressure the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's "views are not the view of the government."But the repercussions had begun.Since the announcement the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania the grants have provided basics like transport medical help and shelter.Many of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks the alliance said.Those unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.'HIV is so much higher in those populations'Being forced to be "invisible" due to "public antagonism" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police said Christine Stegling executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance."All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations" she said explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.According to 2014 UNAIDS data 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population. Globally according to UNAIDS new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.The region where "HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa the second highest is the Caribbean and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior" Chris Beyrer the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health previously told CNN."It's impossible to say there is direct causality but there certainly is a very strong correlation."Being forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification Stegling said."You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex sexuality and conversations around HIV" she said. "In the last couple of years there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs." Stegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.We know what to do but we can't do it she said. There needs to be more peer-led outreach and services as government services will not reach vulnerable people in such political climates. Tanzania's Ministry of Health and a government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.'They are making us fear like we are not human beings'People involved in peer programs in Tanzania risk abuse but believe that in their work to help and educate people about the importance of HIV prevention as well as living with the condition in addition to ensuring that they know their rights -- keeping them out of prison and away from the risk of infection."People are not free" said Faki whose name has been changed to ensure his safety. The government is "making us fear like we are not human beings."Faki has been openly homosexual for just a few years having gained the courage to come out through attending training and information sessions with local community groups. Two years ago he and two fellow activists formed an organization to work primarily with LGBT groups on his home island of Zanzibar a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania. Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam he says his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police. His work has gotten him arrested too he said."We have no support anymore" he said.Just a few days after Makonda's announcement for local task forces in Dar es Salaam Faki helped a group of 10 people who had been beaten and arrested for being gay while on local Pongwe beach he said. They were reported by the driver who took them there. Amnesty International also reported the arrests.At the same time Faki had another LGBT friend come to stay with him in hiding from Dar es Salaam he said.Though his goal in life is to make LGBT people aware of their rights to make them confident about their sexuality in public and in the face of aggressive law enforcement he also worries about the health of this community.Access is a core issue and another prohibitive factor is the attitude of health care workers at clinics he said.If people find out you're gay they're not friendly he said adding that if people do go to clinics for care they can't be free and explain themselves or their situation causing extra problems and "contributing to the spread of HIV."He is not hopeful about his island's or country's future.Global outcry in response to Mankonda's announcement has calmed the situation somewhat in Dar es Salaam and nationwide but not entirely."People don't want to change their mindset on this issue" Faki said referring mainly to government leaders. This means we have to fight he said training people to be aware and confident."It's not easy" he said. "But it's important for them to have knowledge."CNN's Gertrude Kitongo and Bukola Adebayo contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)The people of El Paso Texas are resilient. Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert the city has no other choice. On average 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country. One of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps. Increasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought according to the federal government's most recent national climate assessmentAnalyzing tree ring records scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.  "We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s" said J. Phillip King a professor of civil engineering at New Mexico State University. King has tracked the river's water levels for the past 27 years as an adviser to the Elephant Butte Irrigation District. The district manages the water distribution of some 90000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas. King told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958 the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.What's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.King called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. "You know we've already gotten critically low here and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate" he said. Drought isn't anything new for the 1800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate. And that means not only potentially less snowfall but a greater chance for water to evaporate. The federal government projects that temperatures could rise an additional 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the region by 2100. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir just outside of Truth or Consequences New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers from north of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet King said. Currently it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin. Finding alternativesFor those who rely on the river like the city of El Paso they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity. It is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989 he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers. "I thought we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources" he told Gupta.  Expanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio. Farmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.  David Gutzler a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. "If you can mix and match then you use one or the other" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient he said. But in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water Archuleta made water. He lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant. According to El Paso Water's hydrologists under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water. It's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.  Producing water Today the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water."This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought" Archuleta said. He also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from. The city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.  When Archuleta retired in 2013 water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago despite having 170000 more people to serve. Drinking treated sewageToday El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals it's called "direct potable reuse" or "advanced purification." "It's the logical next step for us to take" said Gilbert Trejo the chief technical officer of El Paso Water. El Paso; Orange County California; Scottsdale Arizona and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.This treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes. El Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.  "We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality" Trejo explained to Gupta. "The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it." According to the EPA the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water. To make sure the water is clean of any pathogens or microbes treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration including UV and carbon filtration. Studies have found that treated water is in fact less likely to have contaminants than untreated river or lake water. Efforts by other municipalities in Texas and California to use "direct potable reuse" haven't always gotten off the ground because of the "ickiness" factor. Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. "These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well." Archuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment. "Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption they take it pretty well." By 2030 El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply and 6% will of come from advanced  purification.  Trejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water. "Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink. Water really is all around us in every city."

 (CNN)Virginia Tech engineering Professor Marc Edwards watched as water flowed from a garden hose in Enterprise Louisiana. As he moved a jar to catch a sample the color changed from clear to brown. "When mine comes out it comes out black" Enterprise resident John Tiser said as he watched Edwards work.Tiser Enterprise's newly appointed water board president was giving Edwards a tour around this rural community in central Louisiana where residents have struggled with water problems. He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water. Concerned about the potential health effects for his family including his two daughters he ran for a seat on the local water board. What drives him Tiser said is "being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them."Years of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them. "We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at" he said.It's what Edwards calls America's "dirty little secret." He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water. The US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system. In his wife's minivan complete with acid stains on the carpet Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations and slowly being forgotten. "It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those. But that van's seen a lot of bad water" he said.Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal state and local governments on water quality. His work helped to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint Michigan. Edwards says Virginia Tech where he is a professor supports his work as long as he can afford to pay for his travel which he has done for years. He has since received an EPA grant of nearly $2 million to seek out water issues in towns like Enterprise.The EPA and the federal government do offer grants and loans to towns. But states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes buildings and structures. In many cases that falls to property owners."I'm not blaming anyone for what happened" says Edwards. "We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them' and when they can't no one's there to help them."An expensive problemIn 2017 Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.Resident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10000 due to corrosive water. "Just in the last four years that I've been here we've been through three hot water heaters"  she said. "We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets we've been through I guess two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape."It's an expensive problem and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water. And for the past year and a half Vinson says she and her family have been routinely sick as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria and her son Blake had bouts of coughing bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. "I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have" she said. "So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower."Vinson's water provider Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic "boil water notices" warning customers of things like "questionable microbiological quality." It's something everyone is more than aware of.  When CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson her home was under a boil water advisory. However the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body."...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water" said Vinson. "So you really don't know what to do."Louisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.  He's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most "distressed." "Systems are going to continue to age and degrade" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. "But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to."The American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed "serious" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.By the numbersThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50000 community water systems across the country for safe reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time."The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants including microorganisms disinfectants disinfection byproducts inorganic and organic chemicals and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink" the EPA said.But a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.In 2016 the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.  But multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse especially in rural America because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data. In a May EPA report the agency's inspector general said "This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards."  "Drinking water is a fundamental human right" said Rep. Dan Kildee a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. "It's something that's necessary to sustain human life and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government."Kildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns but can't get help from the local leadership. And he says the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.The EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But in 2017 only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed. "They don't want to talk about it. Because they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it"  Kildee said referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. "I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore."I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it."  'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'"If we don't fix this problem a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about" said Virginia Tech's Edward. "And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.""There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground dirty water pipe and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase" said Edwards. "But the danger from these pipes is real." Tiser the Enterprise water board president says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. "We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat" he said noting that when he became a member of the water board "I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt."As the cost goes up so do the water bills placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households "and we don't have clean water on top of that" he added. Because Enterprise is in debt the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems. "It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it' " said Tiser. "The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over." He went on to say "This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right? We're all neighbors we all know each other it's the human right thing to do."CNN's Matt Gannon Margaret Dawson and Rich Phillips contributed to this report. ,Health

 (CNN)In the era of #MeToo and stories about the alleged perpetrators of sexual violence CNN's exclusive investigation "Destroyed" turns the spotlight on those responsible for protecting the public.An examination into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute.The number is likely higher and was calculated by analyzing the departments' own records.The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete police investigations. Most of the kits were untested CNN found and dozens were discarded mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence. 'They treated me like trash:' One victim's storyJournalists long ago brought to light the failure of law enforcement agencies to send thousands of rape kits to be analyzed for DNA. That revelation ignited national outrage prompted the passage of laws ordering the testing of rape kits and spurred the Justice Department to award more than $150 million to help analyze the backlog. "Destroyed" exposes a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The rape kits are gone. They can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted. 1. 'A systemic problem'A rape kit should be maintained for at least the length of time a crime can be prosecuted experts told CNN. Yet decisions about whether and when to destroy this evidence CNN found were made without considering the statutes of limitations.Some police departments defended the destruction of kits tied to closed cases that they believed had no chance of moving forward such as when a prosecutor declined to bring a charge or when a victim who reported being raped stopped engaging with police. But experts called that short-sighted.Anything can develop in a case while the statute of limitations is still running. New evidence can emerge or a victim may decide to work again with police for example."What CNN discovered is a systemic problem" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault who ran the San Diego Police Department's sex crimes unit for a decade. "You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations [expires]." Archambault was among the experts CNN asked to review cases that ended in kit destruction. "There are mistakes in these cases" she said "but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence."2. The destruction of kits is a tragedy as troubling as the backlogDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy's office has fought to test the backlog of 10000 unanalyzed kits in Wayne County Michigan. That effort identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. Testing kits can not only solve crimes it can prevent future ones by stopping would-be repeat perpetrators before they strike again. Worthy was stunned to hear that law enforcement agencies have destroyed rape kits -- most of them never analyzed. "All the attention toward untested kits isn't enough if we have agencies destroying kits." She isn't just a prosecutor. She's a survivor. Worthy was raped in law school she said and -- like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally -- she chose not to report her attack. It's a triumph she said when a victim musters the courage to undergo an hours-long invasive forensic examination with the hope that the DNA recovered will aid police in pursuing their assailant."Each one of these kits represents a victim" Worthy said. "What you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice."3. Destruction of rape kits followed poorly conducted investigationsSeasoned police trainers a former prosecutor a DNA analyst and a trauma expert were among those who reviewed investigative case files in which kits were destroyed. They pointed to numerous flaws: kits were not tested suspects were not interviewed witnesses were not pursued. These experts taught CNN reporters who reviewed more than 1400 rape investigations how to discern whether cases were conducted in a thorough and trauma-informed way. Detectives trained in how trauma affects victims know that withdrawal and avoidance are common symptoms. Best practice is to work at a pace set by the victim connect the victim to advocacy services and offer if needed safety measures to protect a victim after a reported assault. It's critical to build rapport with a victim whose trust has been so severely violated experts said. And that can only come by giving victims the time they need.But that's not what CNN and experts saw in case after case. Go inside "The rape files"-- and see what went wrongDetectives imposed arbitrary deadlines on victims and when they did not meet them investigators closed cases labeled victims "uncooperative" and relegated rape kits to evidence rooms until the evidence was trashed. A detective with the Springfield Missouri Police Department sent letters to victims in some cases the day after they reported their assaults warning that if they did not get in touch within 10 business days their cases would not be investigated further. "Victims have lost control of the most personal decision we make -- who we choose to be intimate with. They want some control back... When we send them a letter saying 'Yeah do this or else'... (it) sounds very demanding it sounds very much like what they may have experienced with the offender" said police trainer Tom Tremblay a former sex crimes investigator who reviewed case files for CNN.4. The rape kits of the most vulnerable victims were destroyedIn the cases reviewed by CNN and Marci Hamilton a law professor and attorney who is a nationally recognized expert on child sex crimes law rape kits taken from minors who reported sexual abuse were destroyed by police while the alleged crimes could have still been prosecuted.Typically the statute of limitations to prosecute a sex crime involving a victim who is a minor doesn't start ticking until the victim reaches legal adulthood. "It takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse well into adulthood to decide whether to move forward" Hamilton said. "What police do when they destroy rape kits and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed is rob them of their full chance at justice."CNN highlighted several cases that underscore Hamilton's outrage including that of a 16-year-old who told police in Fayetteville North Carolina that her father raped her.A state crime lab notified the detective that it found the man's sperm in the teen's rape kit. But the investigator did not pursue the man. Instead the detective wrote that he could not find the teenager closed the case and then authorized the destruction of the girl's rape kit. Years later police reopened the case and arrested the father without the evidence they said tied him to the crime. What followed was more anguish for the girl -- now a woman -- and another failure for the department.In Springfield Missouri police trashed a 4-year-old's rape kit and the shorts she was wearing on the day of her alleged assault -- without ever testing that evidence. The girl's mother said she saw a wet spot on her daughter's shorts and the child disclosed to a forensic interviewer that she was touched in her genital area by her uncle. Policing and legal experts who read the case file said it was possible the wet spot was bodily fluid left by the alleged abuser.Without testing the shorts or rape kit evidence police took their investigation to a prosecutor who declined to file charges. The attorney explained her decision in writing: "Unfortunately no corroborating evidence." Police ended the case and two years later in 2014 destroyed the girl's rape kit and shorts. Testing both might have provided corroborating evidence experts said.5. Why this happened and how to start to fix itIt comes down to money training and values. Departments said they didn't have enough of the first two. And experts said the third requires a commitment by agency leaders to examine their department's investigations and ask "How can we do better?"CNN began reporting this project in 2016 after the police chief in Fayetteville North Carolina announced at a news conference that his department had regrettably destroyed 333 rape kits. The officer who discovered the destruction Lieutenant John Somerindyke said detectives had the authority to approve disposal of rape kits in their cases and did so often after conducting poor investigations. The agency failed victims because officers carried caseloads that were too large he said and the department lacked adequate resources. And investigators were not trained to understand how victims behave after trauma. Other departments that destroyed rape kits echoed those complaints.One answer experts said is more training at agencies nationwide on trauma and on the importance of testing and preserving rape kits. They also said departments should regularly audit sex crimes investigations and those audits should ideally be done by professionals outside the agency. For now that isn't happening. But there has long been at least one exception: The Philadelphia Police Department. It began annually reviewing its sex crimes investigations with the help of the Women's Law Project in 2000 after the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the police had mishandled rape cases."It's the essence of community policing" said attorney Carol Tracy director of the Philadelphia Women's Law Project.Tracy reviewed rape investigations for CNN and has consulted with departments across the country grappling with their backlog of untested rape kits."Kits being destroyed" she said. "That is something I didn't realize was happening.",Health
 (CNN)Life expectancy in the United States declined from 2016 to 2017 yet the 10 leading causes of death remained the same according to three government reports released Thursday. Increasing deaths due to drug overdoses and suicides explain this slight downtick in life expectancy the US Centers for Disease Control says.Overdose deaths reached a new high in 2017 topping 70000 while the suicide rate increased by 3.7% the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reports. Dr. Robert Redfield CDC director called the trend tragic and troubling. "Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans too early and too often to conditions that are preventable" he wrote in a statement. General US death ratesThe estimate of how long a person born in 2017 can expect to live in the United States is 78.6 years a decrease of 0.1 year from 2016 the government statisticians say. As usual women will continue to outlive men. In both 2016 and 2017 female life expectancy was 81.1 years while male life expectancy dropped from 76.2 years in 2016 to 76.1 in 2017.The number of resident deaths recorded in the nation totaled more than 2.8 million in 2017 about 69000 more than in 2016 the report shows. Naturally this increase affects the overall death rate which is annually adjusted to account for the changing age of the general population. The rate increased from nearly 729 deaths per 100000 people in 2016 to nearly 732 deaths in 2017 -- a rise of 0.4%. Most races and ethnic groups including black males Hispanic males and Hispanic females saw no significant changes in their death rate year over year. However black females experienced a 0.8% decreasing death rate in 2017 over the previous year meaning they lived a bit longer while the rate increased by 0.6% for white males and by 0.9% for white females. Finally the 10 leading causes of death in 2017 accounting for nearly three-quarters of all deaths across the nation were heart disease cancer unintentional injuries chronic lower respiratory diseases stroke Alzheimer's disease diabetes influenza and pneumonia kidney disease and suicide. This grim "top 10 list" remained unchanged from the previous year. Drug overdose deaths Drug overdose deaths among US residents totaled 70237 in 2017 nearly 6600 more than in 2016 a second government report finds. The rate increased from about 6 overdose deaths per 100000 people in 1999 to nearly 22 per 100000 in 2017.  Rates have been consistently and significantly higher for males than females throughout the years increasing from about 8 men dying of an overdose per 100000 in 1999 to about 29 men per 100000 in 2017. Among women the rate increased from about 4 overdose deaths per 100000 in 1999 to about 14 per 100000 in 2017. Age was an influencing factor in these deaths the researchers found. Adults between 25 and 54 experienced the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in 2017. The 25-to-34 group had nearly 38 overdose deaths per 100000 the 35-to-44 group had 39 per 100000 and the 45-to-54 group had about 38 per 100000.  Younger and older people died by overdose less frequently the report indicates. People between the ages of 15 and 24 experienced about 13 overdose deaths per 100000 those between 55 and 64 experienced 28 per 100000 and the 65 and older age group had about 7 deaths per 100000.  Overall the greatest increase in drug overdose death rates was among adults between 55 and 64 for the period 1999 to 2017: About 4 deaths per 100000 occurred in this group in 1999 compared with 28 per 100000 in 2017.Place also mattered when it came to drug overdose deaths with some states registering higher numbers than others the report shows. The 2017 rate in West Virginia was nearly 58 overdose deaths per 100000 people in Ohio about 46 per 100000 in Pennsylvania about 44 per 100000 and in the District of Columbia 44 per 100000.  Meanwhile Texas (about 10 drug overdose deaths per 100000) North Dakota (about 9 per 100000) South Dakota and Nebraska (both about 8 per 100000) had the lowest rates in 2017.The heroin overdose death rate remained constant at about 5 deaths per 100000 people for both 2016 and 2017; that said it is seven times higher than in 1999. By contrast overdose deaths involving fentanyl fentanyl analogs and other synthetic opioids (other than methadone) increased by 45% between 2016 and 2017 rising from about 6 deaths per 100000 to 9 per 100000. Deaths by suicideOver the past decade suicide has ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States a third new final government report reveals. Though constant the rate has increased over time from about 10 suicides per 100000 in 1999 to 14 per 100000 in 2017. And female suicides increased at a higher rate than male suicides during this period though more men than women die by suicide each year.  Among males the rate increased 26% between 1999 and 2017 from about 18 suicides per 100000 to nearly 22 per 100000. Among females the rate increased 53% from 4 suicides per 100000 in 1999 to nearly 6 per 100000 in 2017. Women between the ages of 45 and 64 experienced the highest rates in both 1999 (6 suicides per 100000) and 2017 (nearly 10 suicides per 100000). Rates in rural US counties are nearly twice as high as in urban counties the government statisticians say. In 1999 the suicide rate for the most rural counties was about 13 per 100000 compared with nearly 10 per 100000 in the most urban counties. In 2017 the suicide rate for the most rural counties (20 per 100000) outpaced that in the most urban counties (about 11 per 100000). However this 2017 urban suicide rate is 16% higher than in 1999 (about 10 per 100000) while the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties is 53% higher than in 1999 (about 13 per 100000) the report indicates."We must all work together to reverse this trend and help ensure that all Americans live longer and healthier" Redfield said in his statement of the decline in life expectancy. He added that the CDC "is committed to putting science into action to protect U.S. health." CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report,Health
Hong Kong (CNN)China has suspended the research activities of the scientists who claimed to have created the world's first gene-edited babies state-run Xinhua news reported Thursday.The moves comes after Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced Monday that two ostensibly healthy twin girls had been born this month from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV.Chinese authorities called He's claim "extremely abominable in nature" and a violation of Chinese law according to Xinhua."The gene-edited twins matter reported by the media has brazenly violated Chinese laws and regulations and breached the science ethics bottom line which is both shocking and unacceptable" said Xu Nanping vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology Xinhua reported. He an associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen claims to have used a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR-cas9 which can insert or deactivate certain genes. CRISPR has been hailed as an innovation with tremendous potential but many in the scientific community believe the technology is still experimental and not ready for human application.It is unknown whether the procedure is safe or if used in pregnancy whether it can have unintended consequences for the babies later in life or for future generations.Editing the genes of embryos intended for pregnancy is banned in many counties including the United States. In the United Kingdom editing of embryos may be permitted for research purposes with strict regulatory approval. China has long been considered on the forefront of gene-editing technology bankrolling expensive research projects and boasting less regulation in the field than Western nations. But He's research has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.He's claims have neither been independently verified nor peer-reviewed. He said his research has been submitted to a scientific journal for review without naming the publication and apologized for the result leaking "unexpectedly."On Wednesday he publicly defended his work at a summit in Hong Kong saying he was "proud" of his achievement. He also raised the possibility of a third child being born after announcing that a separate woman was pregnant at an early stage with a modified embryo.But after He's presentation conference Chairman David Baltimore said the research was not medically necessary as there are other treatments for HIV. Organizers of the conference called for an independent investigation to "verify this claim and to ascertain whether the claimed DNA modifications have occurred."After He's findings were announced the Chinese government ordered an "immediate investigation" into the incident.CNN's Rebecca Wright and Alexandra Field contributed to this report,Health

The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan. Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here. (CNN)I am not a runner. I nearly failed high school gym because I walked the required cross-country course run. I didn't run for exercise at all until age 27 when my now-wife (two-time marathoner lifelong fan of "Chariots of Fire") and I started dating. I've done it sporadically since usually running to coffee shops where the pie I enjoy undoes the work it took to get to it. But at 45 I added marathon to my list of firsts and surprisingly enjoyed a good deal of the preparation for it. In the three months of training (approximately 434 miles of running) I learned new things about myself like how much I can physically endure and what my body and mind require to push past ingrained impulses to quit. I didn't finish with a "good time" but my goal was just to complete it. "It does not matter how slowly you go as long you do not stop" Confucius purportedly said. It's estimated that he was a preteen when the Battle of Marathon took place 8000 miles away. According to legend a runner covered 26.2 miles between Marathon and Athens to announce the Greek victory and upon arrival died of exhaustion. The wisdom I have to share on the topic of long-distance running -- as a novice not an expert -- is both practical and philosophical. And I think the first lesson is that having a goal like a half- or full marathon is an excellent motivator giving you a this-too-shall-pass goal bragging rights and structure. Heart and soulEvolutionarily speaking running long distances is a defining characteristic of being human. We are among the slower animals on the planet but our ancestors were able to catch the other ones and eat them because we have a stamina they lack. It may have taken all day but eventually the cheetah will tire out and slow down to rest and that's how you made ancient cheetah burgers.Beyond species' destiny there are many compelling reasons to run your first (or next) marathon or half-marathon. Barring some injury or other health issue long-distance running is primarily an excellent workout. Obviously exercise in general is fundamental to a high-performing mind and body but running has been specifically tied to living longer through improved heart health (by up to three added years) staving off cognitive decline and getting better sleep. It's not even necessarily bad for your knees despite conventional wisdom. There's enormous psychological benefit as well. I sometimes ran with a worn-out copy of Dr. Thaddeus Kostrubala's "The Joy of Running" in my backpack a bestseller in the 1970s -- an unenlightened age in which it seems very few people ran recreationally some doctors apparently thought it was harmful to health and sports bras had barely been invented.But one of the key arguments the author a psychiatrist makes is the therapeutic benefit of running. The book includes anecdotes of patients lowering their stress levels managing addictions and improving relationships through what he called "running therapy."Since the book was first published the research has caught up to Kostrubala's thesis. Running has been found to be just as effective as psychotherapy in alleviating symptoms of depression according to studies starting in 1979 and to improve self-esteem and reduce stress. There are even psychotherapists who will run with you during your session which Kostrubala pioneered.Vigorous movement releases the brain's own feel-good endorphins producing the well-known "runner's high." Kostrubala goes beyond that neuroscience in his book arguing that slow long-distance running is akin to hallucinogens producing an "altered state of consciousness" that lets you glimpse the workings of your own mind or even facilitate a religious experience. Borrowing a metaphor from Aldous Huxley Kostrubala writes that running may "help each individual open new doors into his own soul." That framing -- running as a beneficial tool -- is a good reminder when all those hours training feel more like a clock-gobbling chore. "Sport is not a test but a therapy; not a trial but a reward; not a question but an answer" wrote George Sheehan author of "Running & Being."  Personally I found running a reliable distraction from -- and physical antidote to -- work stress. It's difficult to mentally multitask while running so music or an audiobook happily hijacked most of my attention. When my mind did wander it was usually in more creative rather than practical directions. And though running can be physically difficult as your body adapts to new longest-ever distances on a training schedule it can also be highly enjoyable. You are outside usually among trees. You're listening to your favorite song or talking with a friend. And when you're done with a run you're rewarded with a sense of accomplishment.Training scheduleI rarely cook and have little confidence when it comes to making a meal which is why I follow recipes to the letter. Same for a running routine. There are many marathon and half-marathon training schedules available all employing an interval method that prescribes how long to run each day of the week. It's about 12 weeks for a half and 18 weeks for a marathon. I used the Hal Higdon novice marathon training schedule ideal for first-timers.Then -- and this was fun for me -- I plotted out routes for all these runs of varying lengths. The tool I found to be the most useful was Google Pedometer. It counts the mileage online as you click various points and it allows for paths (not just roads). I printed the routes out and wrote street directions on them. If I deviated from the course my phone's GPS was my backup. The longest distances in a training schedule are reserved for weekends but I had runs on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays that required not just plotting out routes to and from work but creating a schedule so that I had clothes at work on the mornings I ran there. Once you establish your schedule you'll figure out the flow of clothes and gear. And you'll make mistakes too like the time I had to run with a work shoe in each hand. Later I just started leaving all my work shoes at work.Alone or with othersSome prefer to run in groups or with a buddy while others like myself prefer to pass the miles alone. Running with others creates accountability and gives you someone with whom to talk or commiserate. One recent study found that running in a group reduced anxiety and depression further evidence that Kostrubala was on to something more than 40 years ago. But going solo avoids the pressure to maintain pace with someone or perhaps you prefer music or podcasts over talking. The exception to my self-imposed long-distance loneliness were various weekend races and some runs with my brother-in-law Morgan who may be the most agreeable person on the planet. Try to find someone like Morgan to run with.For weekend training runs over 12 miles entering local races provided bonhomie planned routes herd momentum T-shirts water stations and portable toilets. Races are almost always more fun than being alone. I loved two trail runs I did (with Morgan naturally). And I don't know how I would have finished my longest training run -- 20 miles -- without it being an organized Halloween-themed night race. TechniqueAt the beginning of my training I went to a run clinic at a local athletic shoe store and was given a few key pieces of advice that I employed for the next four months. I didn't worry about my stride except to make sure I was taking short steps instead of overextending.I leaned forward at my ankles not my waist.I kept my midsection tall and my arms at the side pumping to maintain pace. I smiled while running. It improved my mood and a recent study shows that smiling runners are also more efficient.PainYou will ache. You may develop acute pain in certain parts of your body. But you can mitigate that with "dynamic stretching" which emphasizes movement with lunges hip rotations and leg kicks. Dynamic is better than your grandmother's traditional muscle pulls. I printed a series of these yoga-like stretches on the back of my running maps which helped me develop the habit.You may also lose a toenail or two but there's nothing you can do about that. Music and moreIt was nearly as much fun making a mix of all my favorite songs as it was to listen to them while running. I found that everything from John Williams soundtracks to hip-hop to 1960s anthems have their place in a long run. I even made a second "clutch" mix of the ones that can really push me when I'm spent. But I also learned that I can't listen to any music for more than an hour straight before I get sick of it. So I broke up long runs with podcasts (favorites include "Here's the Thing" with Alec Baldwin and the BBC's Desert Island Discs) and audiobooks (ones that delighted most for this marathon training were John Irving's "The World According to Garp" "Guns Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond "A People's History of the United States" by Howard Zinn and one my 11-year-old daughter recommended the YA novel "Lily and Dunkin" by Donna Gephart.)  FuelThink of food as an experiment in which you are learning what your body needs before during and after long runs. Pasta for example is considered an ideal recovery meal and good before a race. For some chocolate milk is a recovery drink but for others it's terrible. For me PB&J makes for a perfect pre-run breakfast and during a run I preferred Sport Beans by Jelly Belly occasional salt tablets and pizza slices to keep me going.ClothesLong runs and nipples have a longstanding feud. Do a Google image search for "bleeding nipples running" if you want to be scared straight or just run 20 miles unprotected. Body Glide is the common solution to chafing but for me that was effective only for runs under 12 miles. It was my ultramarathoner friend Ben who gave me one of the best pieces of advice on this topic: a SmartWool running shirt. I don't understand the textile science behind this miracle but I can attest to it solving the problem.I also recommend buying shoes in a running shoe store. You'll get gait analysis and other expert guidance but even more helpful is that if some issue arises (like my Adidas that started tearing at the seams) they will probably replace them with no shipping or hassle. Prepare to pay at least $125 for good running shoes. One pair should get you through your entire training and marathon.Shopping Content by CNN Underscored: Sneakers for every running gaitFinally since you will almost certainly be running in the dark at some point get a reflective vest or crossing guard-type suspenders of some variety. Being seen by drivers could save your life.Other gearLights are also good for visibility. I had one I attached to my running bag and even light-up shoelaces. You'll also need a headlamp for running in the dark.I eventually bought a Garmin watch because my phone GPS proved inconsistent but Google Pedometer maps were the most reliable. I carried two phones mainly for podcasts audiobooks and music in case one phone died. Shopping content by CNN Underscored: Your guide to buying a running watchI often ran with a Camelbak running bag and for longer non-race runs used the water bladder. But even without the water the bag held fuel snacks work ID keys iPhones and the "Joy of Running" which I read on public transportation for runs that didn't take me all the way to work.I wrote a checklist of things I needed on my trail maps. When I failed to use it I often forgot something.Mantras and mental gamesPassing the time is one thing but there comes a point in every long distance in which your body starts sending signals to your brain to stop running. Pain and exhaustion are the foes of resilience. "The trick is not minding that it hurts" to quote David Lean's titular character in "Lawrence of Arabia." There's a physiological Zen riddle in the notion of acknowledging a wall and running through it anyway.You will probably develop your own mental tricks but mantras help me. The day before I ran my marathon I read a New Yorker magazine story about a member of the SAS the elite British commando unit. I learned that the SAS' unofficial motto is "Always a bit further" a line borrowed from James Elroy Flecker's poem "The Golden Road to Samarkand." I wrote "Always a bit further" on my arm with a Sharpie for the race.Visualizations help too. On long runs I half closed my eyes and imagined in a dreamy state of fatigue that I was running on a beach. Kaye Anne Starosciak the registered dietitian nutritionist and wellness coach at my work offered similar advice which I took because she has run more than 30 marathons herself. She recommends visualizing the finish line. That was helpful especially on marathon day though what saw me to the actual end of the race was my daughters running beside me the last half-mile a moment more perfect and emotional than I had imagined.Starosciak also said her personal goal with long races is to have fun. All this hard work should not be at the expense of joy. Without the joy of running you're just left with running.I'm debating whether to try to run another marathon. But if I do I'll have three goals: finish with a better time don't walk any of it and have more fun.,Health
Hong Kong  (CNN)Humanity was reluctantly dragged into a new era this week. In a video posted on YouTube Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced to the world that he successfully used the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 to modify the DNA of two embryos before birth essentially creating the world's first genetically modified humans. The news delivered on the eve of a high-profile scientific meeting in Hong Kong on human gene editing left the science community in shock. "I see it as one of those moments that happens once every few decades" said William Hurlbut Senior Research Scholar at Stanford University Medical Center's Department of Neurobiology. "Where someone does something that so dramatically changes the landscape that the world will never be the same again."But the scientist who accomplished this history-altering feat was not celebrated nor lavished with praise. In fact his whereabouts are currently unknown. He skipped out early of the very event where he presented his research amid calls for a probe into this work. The Chinese authorities have opened an "immediate investigation" into He and ordered those involved in the project to suspend their activities. Editing the DNA of human embryos that go on to deliver has never been done before. And with good reason scientists say. The technology is still in its infancy and could lead to a multitude of unknown genetic complications later in life. Scientists have reached an understanding that implanting such an embryo is a boundary that shouldn't be crossed until the risks are reduced or eliminated. "No one expected that someone would do this experiment on a human embryo" Feng Zhang one of the inventors of the gene-editing technique CRISPR and member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard told CNN. "The scientific community didn't actually know anything about what was going on."He a professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said he was "proud" of his work that resulted in two ostensibly healthy twin girls born from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV. But he was condemned by his peers and the experiment was labeled "monstrous" "unethical" and a "huge blow" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research. That He could tinker with life changing technology away from the eyes of regulators and purportedly even the university where he conducted the experiment has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.The case also places renewed scrutiny on China a leader in the field of genome editing and biotechnology that has historically had a reputation for sidestepping ethical questions in favor of innovation.But deeper questions are being asked as to whether it is now inevitable that this technology will be used in the future. "Never before have humans had power like this over our own biology" Hurlbut said. "We are now in the era of germline genetic engineering."'A wake up call'Ultimately genome editing shows huge promise in one day treating diseases that are currently untreatable such as sickle cell disease or cystic fibrosis. But scientists at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing where He appeared on Wednesday overwhelmingly said the science needed to be made as effective and safe as possible -- and it was "irresponsible" to use germline editing in a clinical setting at this stage. Germline gene-editing refers to genetic changes in every cell that will be passed on to future generations. This is different to somatic (body) cell gene-editing whereby only existing cells are targeted and the changes made are not passed on to future offspring.Apart from raising ethical concerns scientists said the gene He "edited-out" called CCR5 is crucial to the human immune system and removing it increases the risk of susceptibility to other diseases such as the West Nile virus and influenza. Other critics pointed to the fact that the procedure was not medically necessary as there are other treatments for HIV. Making changes to an embryo could also have unknown consequences that could be passed down to future generations. It was evident that He had not fully considered the potential long-term social effects on the twin girls. When one audience member at the summit asked whether He had thought about how the girls would see themselves and how they would be treated by society he replied: "I don't know how to answer this question."Scientists at the summit pointed out that He's approach to the study had been flawed from start to finish in particular the way he obtained informed consent from the parents -- a process that took place over just two sessions lasting a total of three hours and without an independent third party to properly explain the risks and benefits.He's research has prompted scientists to call for greater transparency and some form of global governance in the field."There has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community because of the lack of transparency" said Conference Chairman and Nobel laureate David Baltimore on Wednesday. 'A gold rush on new kind of knowledge'That the announcement of the world's first genetically edited babies came out of China is perhaps not surprising. Chinese scientists have accomplished many firsts in the genome world including the first CRISPR-edited monkeys the first use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR-Cas9 in humans and the first reported use of gene editing technology to modify nonviable human embryos. China has also pumped huge amounts of government money into gene-editing technology using it to lure leading Chinese scientists living abroad back to the country as well as foreigners who see the country as fertile ground for this kind of research."I just think right now China is a lot more driven they incentivize their scientists to move faster and be bolder and it shows" said Victor J. Dzau President of the Institute of Medicine at the US National Academy of Medicine. Last year China spent a record 1.76 trillion yuan ($254 billion) on research and development and the country is catching up with the US' investment in the same area spurring a genetic arms race that has been labeled "Sputnik 2.0" by Dr. Carl June an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.And Chinese regulators appear more open to the new tech than its US counterparts. As of the end of February 2018 there were nine registered clinical studies testing CRISPR-edited cells to treat various cancers and HIV infection in China according to Goldman Sachs analysis in April. That's compared to one in the US after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its hold on the first US-based human CRISPR trial in October."It's clear that this is the new frontier" said Hervé Chneiweiss of France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. "It's clearly the gold rush on any kind of new knowledge that could be translated into new treatments."Many of these treatments exist in a legal gray area. Currently each country has their own rules and regulations surrounding gene-editing. China has several loosely-worded regulations restricting experimental science including rules on embryo research. A 2003 directive to in-vitro clinics by the Chinese Ministry of Health barred "clinical experiments" that "violate ethical or moral principles.""The problem is there are no penalties" if the guidelines are breached said Renzong Qiu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.In an effort to show the world that China is holding up ethical standards the nation's vice minister of the Ministry of Science and Technology Xu Nanping said Thursday that He had "brazenly violated Chinese laws and regulations and breached the science ethics bottom line." Both the hospital named in He's ethical approval documents and the university he is affiliated with deny involvement in the procedures. And in a joint statement issued Monday more than 120 Chinese scientists condemned the research saying that "directly experimenting on humans is nothing but crazy.""There's a misconception that the advance in research must necessarily come with being more flexible with respect to regulation" said David R Liu professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University who has pioneered improving versions of CRISPR. "I caution that people should not take away from recent news that China is being less vigilant or less caring about these ethical breaches than any other country."In the short term perhaps the greatest risk of misuse is not so much direct harm to people but the potentially chilling effect on legitimate research should governments and regulators push for greater restrictions.With reporting from Oscar Holland in Hong Kong and Serenitie Wang and Steven Jiang in Beijing,Health
 (CNN)Rice University is investigating bioengineering professor Michael Deem after he was quoted in media reports as having been involved with the work of He Jiankui the Chinese researcher who claims to have created the world's first gene-edited babies. Deem was He's adviser at Rice for 3½ years and published three papers with He."This research raises troubling scientific legal and ethical questions" said Doug Miller director of Rice University's media relations team. In a statement Miller said Rice had "no knowledge of this work." "We have begun a full investigation of Dr. Deem's involvement in this research."He claims that he used a tool called CRISPR-Cas9 which can insert or deactivate certain genes to alter the CCR5 gene in the DNA of several embryos to make them resistant to HIV. Two babies twin girls named Lulu and Nana were supposedly born a "few weeks ago" He announced in a video on YouTube saying they were "as healthy as any other babies" and were home with their parents Grace and Mark. He defended his his work Wednesday at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing conference in Hong Kong and announced that there was a second pregnancy using genetically edited eggs which he said was in an early stage.Worldwide reaction to He's Sunday announcement was swift. Hundreds of Chinese biomedical and AIDS researchers issued statements condemning the research. Several scientists said the experiment was "monstrous" "premature dangerous and irresponsible." The Chinese government announced an "immediate investigation" to verify He's claims questioning the ethical approval process and wondering whether the families were adequately informed of the nature of the experiment.Deem has not responded to CNN's calls and emails but told The Associated Press that he was in China with the families at the time they gave consent and "absolutely" believed they understood the risks. Deem also said he holds "a small stake" and is on the scientific advisory board of two of He's companies.Rice University said it did not believe that any of the clinical work was performed in the United States but "regardless of where it was conducted this work as described in press reports violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University."While at Rice Deem has worked extensively on influenza vaccine efficacy immune system modulation and HIV. Deem also says a research interest is the "mathematical model of evolution that accounts for cross-species genetic exchange."A recent paper by Deem on math modeling for flu was co-written by biomedical ethics researcher Kirstin Matthews at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.Matthews wrote in an email that she was surprised "to find out that Professor Deem was involved in this research." Adding that she had only recently began working with Deem she said she had not "seen anything to suggest that Professor Deem's scientific work is in question" nor did she believe any data in co-authored paper was affected."Had Professor Deem informed me of his work using CRISPR on human embryos to develop a baby I would have recommended extreme caution using this technology on human embryos and to wait for more data on risks before using manipulated embryos for pregnancies" Matthews wrote.Deem's past work has been funded by various governmental agencies including the National Institutes of Health but spokeswoman Renate Myles said Deem has not received a grant from that agency since 2014.In a statement Wednesday Director Dr. Francis Collins reiterated the agency's stance against gene-editing in human embryos and expressed deep concern over He's behavior:"This work represents a deeply disturbing willingness by Dr. He and his team to flaunt international ethical norms. The project was largely carried out in secret the medical necessity for inactivation of CCR5 in these infants is utterly unconvincing the informed consent process appears highly questionable and the possibility of damaging off-target effects has not been satisfactorily explored."Should such epic scientific misadventures proceed a technology with enormous promise for prevention and treatment of disease will be overshadowed by justifiable public outrage fear and disgust."According to a news release on the Rice University website He became a graduate student under Deem in 2007 and co-wrote several papers "of tremendous significance" with Deem. He who the university says was "the son of rice farmers in Hunan Province in China" was lead author with Deem on a paper presenting a mathematical model that could determine within two weeks whether a new strain of the influenza virus should be included in the annual seasonal flu vaccine. The World Health Organization's model takes up to six months."Jiankui is a very high-impact student" Deem said in 2010. "He has done a fantastic job here at Rice and I am sure he will be highly successful in his career."CNN's Oscar Holland and Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)In his kitchen chef Seamus Mullen is cutting up avocados as he recalls a time when it felt like he was the one getting sliced. "Initially I just felt like my whole body was achy. It went from that to acute attacks like having a knife stabbed in my shoulder. Then I would get a pain that felt like there was a nail going through my joint. I had no idea what was going on." He tried his best to work through the pain chalking it up to exhaustion from long hours in the kitchen. For a new chef trying to break into the industry 16-hour work shifts and 90-hour weeks were the norm. "It was really brutal but that's sort of how you cut your teeth and learned how to become a professional chef. We worked hard. Unfortunately we didn't necessarily work smart."But the hard work was paying off. Mullen's star was heating up in the culinary world. Outside of his restaurant work he began appearing on shows like "The Next Iron Chef" and "Chopped." He didn't have time for the mysterious pains to derail his career. Burnt outThe long hours and physical labor however began taking a bigger toll on Mullen's health. He was gaining weight and suffering more acute attacks as the chronic pain spread across his body. Then one morning he woke up with hip pain so bad he couldn't move. A trip to the ER and an MRI revealed that his hip was full of fluid. Mullen was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease."I like many people thought arthritis was a disease or an affliction of the elderly. That was shocking to learn that it was a debilitating disease that would have a long-term permanent impact on my life and my well-being. It was really scary."Fearing that his disease could leave him in a wheelchair or with hands no longer able to cook Mullen was up against the wall."I had to make a choice about whether I was going to just accept being a sick person or if I was going to crawl my way out of this somehow. I made a promise to myself that I was going to change my life. I didn't know what I was going to do. But I was going to take control of my health."Recipe for healthSo Mullen began cooking up ways to improve his health starting with his diet."I came from a professional background of knowing how to make food really delicious but I didn't really know what happened to that food. So many of the foods that I was eating were having an inflammatory impact on my body."Mullen stopped eating processed foods and any foods known to be inflammatory. With everything he ate he would ask "is this helping me or harming me?"The ones that helped he labeled "hero foods."On the day of this interview Mullen let CNN film him making lunch: a small plate of hard-boiled eggs and a salad of kohlrabi radish cucumber shallot avocado anchovies and extra virgin olive oil."It's a simple salad that's really tasty and full of great stuff. Healthy fats from the extra virgin olive oil and anchovies as well as the omega-3s and tons of vegetables."Though these foods check the "hero" mark he points out that everyone should find the right mix of food that works for them. "For me it might be avocados; for someone else it might be almonds. I think it's really important for everyone to start to understand the foods that make them feel really good."The change has been dramatic. There was a time when even getting out of bed was a challenge for Mullen. He's now pain-free and practices yoga lifts weights bikes and cooks without fearing an arthritic attack. "I'm glad that I got sick. I'm glad that I went through this really difficult and horrific period of my life because I came out of it with a greater sense of purpose."He's now trying to be a hero for others with similar pain. In his cookbooks "Real Food Heals" and "Hero Food" Mullen shares ways he's rediscovered his joy of cooking and eating."It's very important to remember that you can eat really well for health and at the same time eat well for pleasure indulgence and joy.",Health
 (CNN)At Mercy Children's Hospital the nurses and staff of the neonatal intensive care unit pool their money to enter the lottery. They've been doing it for for years with varying degrees of success. Last month the staffers at the St. Louis-area hospital won big: $10000 in the Mega Millions lottery. But instead of divvying up the winnings among their group they gave the money to two colleagues going through some tough times. The joyous discoveryThe lottery pool began as a way to bring some levity."We have a very stressful job so it's just something fun that keeps us going" nurse Gretchen Post told CNN. As last month's jackpot grew to $1.6 billion nurse -- and lottery pool organizer --  Stephanie Brinkman stayed up late and watched the results come in. Soon her phone was lighting up with calls and messages from her colleagues. They had a winning ticket. "I was so in shock I couldn't believe it" Brinkman said. The shocking newsThe group's elation soon met a sobering reality. They learned that Post's 17-year-old son had killed himself just a few hours before the drawing. The staff chatted on Facebook and came up with a decision: Give the money to Post  for her son's funeral expenses -- and to a neonatologist Dr. Casey Orellana whose husband was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.Each of the women received $3600. The donationPost says she was grateful for the gesture and immediately told the rest of her family. "It was a little bit of relief that I would have some money to help with Jack's funeral" she says. "It just came at the right time." Post says Jack was proud of his mother's career and had thought about going to medical school to become a psychiatrist. "He was very compassionate and intellectual so I think he would have done so."CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed the title of Dr. Casey Orellana. The story has been updated.,Health
 (CNN)Less than 11 months after Cameron Underwood underwent a face transplant the 26-year-old is revealing himself to the world.Underwood of Yuba City California sustained a self-inflicted gunshot to the face in June 2016. The extensive damage left him missing most of his lower jaw his nose and every tooth but one a statement said. He also experienced damage to his upper face and palate. Conventional reconstructive surgery which he reportedly tried several times could only do so much.Then Underwood's mother Beverly Bailey-Potter read a magazine article about Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez a professor of reconstructive plastic surgery and the chair of the plastic surgery department at NYU Langone Health. "We knew he was the only person to whom we would trust Cameron's life" she said in the release from the hospital. "We were willing to travel the long distance."Since the first face transplant was done in France in 2005 more than 40 have been completed around the world. NYU Langone Health has completed two of the procedures and has a designated face transplantation program one of just a handful in the United States. Rodriguez completed two previous face transplants the first at University of Maryland and headed up a team of more than 100 medical professionals who tackled Underwood's case. The transplant surgery lasted about 25 hours. Underwood's journey has been marked by milestones. The time between his injury and face transplant was just about 18 months the shortest period between the two in publicly reported cases in the United States the hospital said.This is significant in helping his physical emotional and psychological recovery Rodriguez said."Cameron has not lived with his injury for a decade or longer like most other face transplant recipients have" Rodriguez said in the statement. "As a result he has not had to deal with many of the long-term psycho-social issues which often lead to issues like severe depression substance abuse and other potentially harmful behaviors." Underwood also experienced one of the shortest wait times for a donor the hospital said. Once he was approved for a transplant by NYU Langone and put on the list for organ donation he waited only six months for the early January call that would change his life.His donor was William Fisher a 23-year-old resident of New York who was an aspiring filmmaker and writer. Fisher who registered as an organ donor when he was a teen gave to more than just Underwood. He also gave his heart kidneys liver eyes and other tissues.In honoring her son's wishes Fisher's heartbroken mother got something in return."Being a part of this experience has been a source of strength for me during a very difficult time" she said in the statement. "I don't think I would have survived Will's death if not for Cameron. Cameron has his whole life ahead of him -- and I love the idea that Willie is helping him have a better life." Underwood was discharged from the hospital in mid-February but initially stayed in New York for rehabilitation which included speech therapy and orthodontic treatment. By the end of March he was home in California -- though he's made monthly trips back to New York for followup visits. He will remain on anti-rejection drugs throughout his life but to date has responded well. And he's grateful for this second chance at life -- and the medical team and donor who made it possible."We hope my experience inspires others who have severe facial injuries to have hope as I was inspired by others who came before me" Underwood said in the statement. "The journey hasn't been easy but it's been well worth it." ,Health
 (CNN)Climate change is here and affecting our health with extreme heat in particular also having effects on productivity food supply and disease transmission a new global report finds.More people than ever are vulnerable to heat exposure globally and numbers are rising according to The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report by an international group of researchers published Wednesday.It comes just days after climate reports from the US government and the United Nations said that greater action on climate change is needed with the UN report showing that in 2017 the highest levels of carbon were emitted globally.Older people in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean are most vulnerable because of larger aging and urban populations there.The latest report estimates that 42% of over-65s in Europe  and 43% in the the Eastern Mediterranean are already vulnerable to heat exposure; 38% of this group is vulnerable in Africa and 34% in Asia.The report identified present-day changes impacting public health including lower productivity decreased crop yields and spread of diseases such as dengue and cholera said researchers from 27 global institutions including universities and research centers and the UN who put together the study.Present changes in heat waves and labor capacity "provide an early warning of the compounded and overwhelming impact on public health that is expected if temperatures continue to rise" said Hilary Graham professor of health sciences at the University of York in the UK who participated in the report.In 2017 157 million vulnerable people were exposed to heat waves globally and 153 billion hours of labor were lost due to heat exposure.The United States has seen more frequent and longer-lasting heatwaves and a rise in vector-borne disease with cases of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes ticks and fleas such as Lyme disease and West Nile virus tripling between 2004 and 2016 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Dr. Nick Watts executive director of The Lancet Countdown stressed that this is "not something that's happening in 2050 but something that we're already seeing today.""High- and low- income countries are affected negatively" said Elizabeth Robinson professor of environmental economics at the University of Reading who was involved in the report. This just manifests in different ways she added. The second in a series with the first released last year  the report analyzes 41 indicators tracking the link between climate change and health in five areas: climate change impacts resilience for health mitigation actions finance and public engagement. Robinson explained that there "is a lot of variability year on year" but "the trend appears to be upwards" indicating even more heat wave events in the future. Similarly numbers of vulnerable people "are going up over time."Some progress but far from enoughThere have been some promising trends like an increase in renewable energy with jobs in that sector rising by 5.7% between 2016 and 2017 according to the report. But the investment in renewables "is not yet anything like what it would need to be if we are to get to the 1.5 degrees" -- a commitment agreed during the Paris Climate Agreement to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-Industrial Revolution levels said Paul Ekins professor of resources and environment policy at University College London who was involved in the report.Some positive trends were also identified in the form of coal phaseouts and cleaner healthier transportation methods. But coal usage needs to be at 20% of 2010 usage levels by 2040 to meet targets the report states.Dr. Renee Salas doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who authored the American chapter of the Lancet report said it delivers a message of hope as action is happening but she pointed out that "climate change is harming the health of this country now." This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment report published by the White House on Friday. This year marked a record summer in many parts of the world with much higher temperatures than most populations are used to. Watts highlighted a recent study suggesting that the 2018 heat waves across Europe were made twice as likely as a result of climate change. "Assigning attribution for every single event is difficult but it's clear that these sorts of events are examples of what is likely to come if we don't rapidly respond to climate change" he said. The research identified that the global population was on average exposed to a temperature increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1986 and 2017. The global surface temperature change for this period was 0.3 degrees Celsius. This shows that "populations are aging growing and migrating in to the areas worst affected by climate change" Watts explained.Salas said that "We must take aggressive action to combat climate change today so that by the end of the century we'll have saved thousands of lives each year along with hundreds of billions of dollars in public health cost."Spread of diseases and fatalitiesSmall changes in temperature and rainfall will also help the spread of infectious diseases the report found.For example the capacity of the dengue virus to spread has increased by 7.8% since the 1950s. The seasonal capacity for the Aedes mosquito -- the primary species spreading Zika dengue and chikungunya -- and its ability to spread have lengthened and strengthened the report says. 2016 had the most dengue transmission on record according to the report and the spread is expected to rise in line with greenhouse gas emissions. Kristie Ebi a professor of global health at the University of Washington who also was involved in the report said the geographic spread of the mosquito that can carry dengue Zika and chikunguya has increased "dramatically with higher temperatures." She added that the researchers don't see the impacts individually but stressed the wide-ranging effects of climate change.Levels of global cholera bacteria are also worrying. An increasing trend of rising suitability to Vibrio the bacteria that can cause cholera and some other illnesses has been observed globally. The United States witnessed a 27% increase in coastline areas that are suitable for Vibrio infections between the 1980s and 2010s.We "can not ignore these challenges we are seeing" said Gina McCarthy director of the Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was not involved in report. She cited the California wildfires and the rise in vector-borne diseases.Deaths from pollutionA "lack of progress" in reducing emissions continues to endanger lives and public health care systems according to the researchers.Europe was the region with most premature deaths from ambient air pollution in the form of PM2.5 -- particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter  -- in 2015 followed by the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia the report found.Particulate matter can settle in airways and cause problems like cardiovascular disease respiratory conditions and cancers leading to premature death according to the World Health Organization.Paul Ekins a professor of resources and environment policy at University College London who was involved in the report stressed that "any notion we may have that somehow in Europe we are kind of doing better than other regions should be displaced."Reduced productivity  Extreme heat as a result of climate change cost the world 153 billion hours of work last year the report found. In China alone 21 billion hours of work were lost to extreme heat in 2017 equal to 1.4% of the country's working population. Robinson said that rising temperatures have "a direct impact on labor." The majority of labor hours losses occurred in more vulnerable regions such as India southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and South America. After decades of global improvement in food security the report shows that crop yields are falling in 30 countries including Cuba the UAE and Luxembourg. In some countries the difference between the actual crop yield achieved and the maximum crop yield proves that negative impacts of climate change cancel out technological improvements according to a 2011 study published in the Nature international journal of science. Are we able to cope?Watts warned that the report shows over half -- 51% -- of 478 global cities surveyed stated that their public health infrastructure will be seriously compromised by climate change by overwhelming services with new health threats or from extreme weather events directly threatening health services. This means "systemic failure" Watts said like the shutdown of a hospital. Global spending on climate adaptation for health is at 4.8% -- too little to keep in line with the Paris Climate Agreement the researchers say. Europe and Southeast Asia are the biggest spenders with low-income countries' funding too little to meet their needs according to the report. The report has upped the stakes for faster progress Ekins said.He believes that the findings represent a "worse outlook because we weren't moving fast enough for 2 degrees" as agreed in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference "and we're definitely not moving fast enough for 1.5" degrees.Watts noted that the Lancet Countdown report is not able to say in which direction the world is heading but "whichever way we go it ends up shaping the health profile of countries for the next century." ,Health
 (CNN)A mother whose toddler died weeks after they were released from a Texas immigrant detention center has filed a wrongful death claim seeking $60 million from the US government.  Yazmin Juarez's 19-month-old daughter Mariee died in May six weeks after they were released from the immigration facility in Dilley. Juarez and her attorney allege that ICE and those running the facility provided substandard medical care for the toddler after she suffered a respiratory infection while in detention. "The US government had a duty to provide this little girl with safe sanitary living conditions and proper medical care but they failed to do that resulting in tragic consequences" attorney R. Stanton Jones said in a statement."Mariee entered Dilley a healthy baby girl and 20 days later was discharged a gravely ill child with a life-threatening respiratory infection. Mariee died just months before her 2nd birthday because ICE and others charged with her medical care neglected to provide the most basic standard of care as her condition rapidly deteriorated and her mother Yazmin pleaded for help."They were detained for three weeks Immigration officials detained the mother and daughter in March after they came from Guatemala and crossed into the US via the Rio Grande.  They were taken to the government-run South Texas Family Residential Center where they were held for three weeks. Juarez sought medical treatment for her daughter on March 11 -- six days after they arrived at the Dilley facility her attorney said. At the facility the child became increasingly ill and Juarez repeatedly sought health care for her daughter but was prescribed medication that didn't improve her condition her lawyer said. As soon as they were released from the facility Juarez  took Mariee to New Jersey where her mother lives and sought medical attention the next day. Mariee was hospitalized for respiratory failure for six weeks and died at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on May 10 according to Juarez's lawyer. "After it became clear that Mariee was gravely ill ICE simply discharged mother and daughter" Jones said. "Yazmin immediately sought medical care for her baby but it was too late."Officials defend medical care at facilityJuarez filed the claims against various government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Homeland Security which oversees Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declined to comment citing pending litigation. "However lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations" CBP said in a statement. "In DHS's homeland security mission our trained law enforcement professionals adhere to the department's mission uphold our laws while continuing to provide our nation with safety and security. A spokeswoman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement defended the medical care  at the facility. "ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency's custody including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care" Jennifer Elzea said.  "... Staffing includes registered nurses and licensed practical nurses licensed mental health providers mid-level providers that include a physician's assistant and nurse practitioner a physician dental care and access to 24-hour emergency care." In August Juarez's lawyer filed a notice of claim against the city of Eloy Arizona which was the prime contractor for the federal government in operating the Dilley facility. The claim sought $40 million for wrongful death.,Health
 (CNN)There's a certain irony that when world leaders meet in early December at the COP24 global climate conference they will be doing so in the heart of Poland's coal country.The host city of Katowice is in the center of Silesia a region that is home to about 90000 coal workers -- around half of all the coal workers in the EU.Coal is hugely important for Poland. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently referred to it as "our black gold."The country is the biggest producer of hard coal in the EU and coal power provides about 80% of Poland's electricity compared to an average of 30% among International Energy Agency member countries.But coal accounts for almost half of global energy-related CO2 emissions and like other coal-dependent countries Poland is trying to adapt to a world that needs to cut emissions to slow global warming.Read: The past four years have been the hottest on record and we are seeing the effectsThe EU has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030 and last week unveiled a plan to be net zero by 2050. Poland's CO2 emissions per capita are slightly above the EU average but its emissions per GDP are third-highest in the EU.But there are signs that is changing.Marek Wąsiński an analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs a government-funded think tank told CNN: "Like other EU countries Poland is also moving away from coal. It's not a revolution it's a slow evolution of the energy sector."Although it makes up less than 10% of its energy mix Poland has around 6000 megawatts of wind power capacity putting it among the leading nations in the EU. Construction of the Baltic Pipe Project is set to start in 2020 which will supply natural gas from Norway to Poland. Natural gas produces much less CO2 than coal when it's burned for energy but methane leakage can limit its climate benefits. Read: Planet has until 2030 to stem catastrophic climate change experts warnThe Ministry of Energy's draft energy policy published last week said that by 2030 60% of power will come from coal. It expects to have up to 9000 MW of nuclear power by 2043 and 30000 MW of off-shore wind and solar power by 2040.Coal legacyMichał Kurtyka COP 24 President and Secretary of State in the Ministry of Environment told CNN that Poland inherited a legacy of coal from its decades in the Eastern Bloc -- which ended in 1989 -- but had since managed to successfully transition its economy."In 1990 the Polish energy mix was 96% coal" he said. "There was a very high share of employment in coal and very big industrial production the result of this communist conviction that only through industrialization could the Soviet Bloc compete with Western economies.  "When we entered into the transformation phase this idea of transition of employment and changing industrial structure in many industrial regions but starting with Silesia was a very big challenge but it's working very well right now."Katowice is an example of the transformation. It's a green city 40% of the city is covered with parks and quite a substantial part of production and employment is going to IT business centers value-added services and new industries."But the move away from coal isn't happening fast enough for some environmental groups. Client Earth is a charity that uses legal avenues to protect the environment."The government targets are not in line with the Paris Agreement" Client Earth's Ilona Jędrasik told CNN. "To have so much electricity still come from coal by 2040 is impossible from an economic point of view. By then renewables will be way cheaper than coal -- keeping coal at that point makes no sense."Read: Donald Trump buried a climate change report because 'I don't believe it'Economics is another argument against Polish coal.Rapidly rising carbon prices in the EU are making coal power increasingly expensive. Poland's coal sector struggles to make a profit and many power plants are nearing the end of their lifespans.Last month Client Earth launched a lawsuit against the construction of the long-proposed 1000 MW Ostrołęka C coal power station in northern Poland -- a joint venture between power companies Enea and Energa.But it didn't bring the lawsuit on environmental grounds; instead as a minority shareholder in Enea Client Earth argues that the power company has failed to manage material climate-related financial risk associated with the project."We are arguing that it's not economically profitable because of the rising prices of CO2 emissions and there is a legal risk of this kind of investment also when it comes to climate policy and climate regulations at an EU level" said Jędrasik.Enea and Energa didn't respond to repeated requests from CNN to comment but Energa President Arkadiusz Siwko said in July that the power plant "contributes to the process of modernizing national power sector ... and what is important will be fired with Polish coal." He added that it would provide "a satisfactory rate of return for our shareholders."The mayor of Ostrołęka said the power plant would provide jobs for the city.'Just transition'It's with an eye on the 90000 Polish jobs in the coal sector that the Polish government has drafted the Silesia Declaration on Solidarity and Just Transition which heads of state will be asked to adopt at the opening of COP24.The declaration "is dedicated to ensuring a fair and solidarity-based transformation that will help to protect the climate while maintaining economic development and jobs."Kurtyka says Poland must look for opportunities to create jobs at the same time as tackling climate change."There are technologies that provide not only environment and climate benefits but also social and industrial benefits" he said. "For example there's a growing industry in Poland around electro mobility and batteries especially in Silesia."The message is that we want to operate this transition together with people and not against them." ,Health
 (CNN)The current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- with 426 total cases including 245 deaths -- is now the second largest and second deadliest in history according to Thursday's report from the nation's Ministry of Health. A 2000-01 outbreak in Uganda included 425 cases and caused 224 deaths according to the World Health Organization. The deadliest outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2014 when the disease killed more than 11000 people. "This is a milestone nobody wanted to hit" WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic wrote in an email. On average Ebola -- which causes fever severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected but case fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo which began in August has a case fatality rate of 57%. Of the total cases 379 have been confirmed and 47 are probable according to the ministry. An additional 87 suspected cases are under investigation.On a positive note 126 patients have recovered the ministry said. This is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo where the virus is endemic and the second this year.North Kivu province which includes the cities Beni Kalunguta and Mabalako remains the epicenter of the outbreak though cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province according to WHO. The two provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda Rwanda and South Sudan. "The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as to neighbouring countries remains very high" WHO said in a statement Thursday. However there have been no confirmed cases in Congo's neighbors Jasarevic said. "All neighboring countries have implemented heightened surveillance and are detecting and investigating alerts and suspected Ebola cases."Cases continue to mushroomRecent spread of the infection to people in Butembo a city that's home to 1.2 million "raised concerns" wrote Lawrence O. Gostin a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law and his co-authors in an editorial published online Thursday in the medical journal JAMA. Seeing "gaps in the response" Gostin and his co-authors recommend that the United States and allies "mobilize high-level political attention and resources for the Ebola response" and "develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu."In October US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel who had been stationed in Congo had been pulled back from the worst affected areas due to safety concerns a US government official familiar with the situation said at the time. Not only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola but long-term conflict smolders there with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence according to WHO. A senior White House official confirmed this month that US government personnel who had been working on the ground in Beni had been evacuated to other parts of Congo due to safety concerns. The official said that the situation is being evaluated constantly and that in the meantime the US continues to provide technical and financial assistance to contain the outbreak.Jasarevic described the overall environment as "complex and challenging.""On Friday 16 November a second attack in one week occurred in Beni" he reported. "UN peacekeepers and government forces engaged with rebel forces. By Sunday November 18 all activities in Beni were re-launched including vaccination."  Jasarevic says the response in areas outside Beni has not been affected by conflict but WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Despite such risks and safety concerns Congo's response effort has been robust.  The Ministry of Health has 900 people active in the response according to Jasarevic and of these 85% are from the local area. Additionally WHO has deployed 300 of its own staff to the region. The latest minstry report indicates that 37559  people have received an experimental vaccine in a campaign that began August 8. "This includes over 11100 health and frontline workers and 9300 children" Jasarevic said.The experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine made by pharmaceutical company Merck proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea according to WHO. Gostin and his co-authors are doubtful. "Despite deploying an experimental vaccine cases doubled in October 2018" they wrote. More generally they believe that the overall response which also includes contact tracing and investigational treatments may not be adequate.'Cascading transmission' of the disease"Of 137 confirmed cases between October 28 and November 26 only 19 were found through contact tracing 32 were on contact lists but lost to follow-up and 83 (61%) had no known links to confirmed cases" Gostin and his co-authors wrote. "These data suggest contact tracing and vaccination have not prevented cascading transmission." Gostin also believes that "community distrust is deep after decades-long humanitarian crises impeding information-sharing and cooperation." They note that WHO and UN pledged enhanced security operations this month "yet lethal attacks have persisted."Nora Love field director for the International Rescue Committee's operations in the region offers a more nuanced view.From mid-September through the end of last week the nonprofit humanitarian group has trained over 730 health care workers who staff the dozens of health care facilities between the group's two field offices in Beni and Butembo."It's a very lush green area that rains every day and the temperatures are pretty nice but it's definitely a city at the edge of a country and you can see that it also has been under conflict. There's definitely a tension within the communities here" Love said. "You know that you're in a conflict area. There's always some sort of insecurity happening every single day." Despite this she does not feel "unwelcome here from the community" she said and she does not feel under threat because she works within health facilities "which are a little bit more isolated than going to a village." Getting ahead of an infectious disease"The people who are doing the safe burials have been the most exposed and the most vulnerable because people are very emotional after they lost a loved one" Love said. "And the protocols for safe burial are different than the traditional burials here and that causes some distress within the community." Traditional burials involve touching the body of the deceased. To prevent spread of the infectious disease safe burials require protective equipment and sanitizing the family's environment.Still Love has witnessed "violent reactions" at hospitals and health facilities when deaths occur. Patients have been forcefully removed from the hospital by their loved ones she said. "Last week they went to a hospital when somebody died and they did vandalism and burned some things" Love said. "Luckily so far no health workers have been harmed by this but there's always a watching and being aware that it could flare up."Violence is not the only challenge as Beni has recently experienced a "significant increase" in the number of malaria cases according to a recent report from the Ministry of Health. Love's main frustration has been the difficulty of getting "ahead of things. Just when we feel we've made strides in one location then the outbreak has moved somewhere else" she said. As a result her organization has been exploring new strategies to see whether it can become more flexible and more rapid in its response.Meanwhile the larger response persists. Health care workers continue with vaccination efforts as WHO along with Congo conducts its first randomized control trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the experimental drugs offered under "compassionate use" to treat Ebola patients.WHO said it remains "focused on the ongoing containment efforts to end the outbreak" and recommends that neighboring provinces and countries "enhance surveillance and preparedness activities."   "We want to make sure that the international community does have its eyes on it and not just the UN" Love said.Jasarevic remains hopeful: "We are confident that working together with all our partners we can and will end it.",Health
 (CNN)Monday marks the annual International Day of Persons with Disabilities. The United Nations set up the global observance in 1992 to promote the welfare of people with disabilities and raise awareness of the difficulties they often face. More than 1 billion people across the world -- about 15% of everyone on the planet -- have some sort of disability according to the UN. And half of all people with disabilities can't afford health care.The theme for this year's observance is "Empowering persons with disabilities and ensuring inclusiveness and equality."Throughout this year the CNN series "Turning Points" has highlighted people who embody that theme.There's the young woman who recovered from a vegetative state and became a competitive dancer.An artist paralyzed from the neck down who paints stunning pictures with a brush in his mouth. There is a blind competitive swimmer and a wheelchair-bound comedian putting a new spin on stand-up comedy. Another inspiring story features a war veteran who became a champion hockey player after losing his leg in Iraq.And there's a girl horribly burned who became a respected beauty blogger.These are people of courage living up to the ideals of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. They've overcome tremendous challenges made their own dreams come true and now inspire others to do the same.,Health
 (CNN)Progress has stalled in ridding the world of polio. An emergency committee of the World Health Organization unanimously agreed Friday to continue to designate the paralyzing disease a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern."  WHO originally designated polio in this way in 2014 deeming it a health threat serious enough to endanger communities worldwide.This year WHO has recorded 27 cases of wild poliovirus worldwide compared with 22 total cases last year. Though the small number of cases may appear insignificant the committee said the trend is noteworthy because it shows stagnation. Poliomyelitis which is transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or through contaminated food mainly affects young children. Fever fatigue headache vomiting stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs are symptoms of the disease which also can cause permanent paralysis. There is no cure for polio and it can be prevented only by vaccine.  The Global Polio Eradication Initiative a partnership of WHO UNICEF the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Rotary International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was initiated 30 years ago. In 1988 polio was endemic in 125 countries and sickened 350000 children annually but as a result of the public-private initiative polio is now endemic in just three nations -- Afghanistan Nigeria and Pakistan -- while total cases have dropped more than 99% according to WHO.On Friday the WHO emergency committee praised the "continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan" yet it noted that the number of wild polio cases in Afghanistan has almost doubled in 2018 with 19 cases reported this year compared with 10 at the same time last year. In Pakistan the 2018 polio situation is stagnant compared with last year while in Nigeria more than two years have passed since the last case of poliovirus was detected the committee noted. In 2016 Nigeria reported a case of wild poliovirus after two years with none; WHO committee members did not speculate when the nation which recorded 27 cases of vaccine-derived polio this year would be declared free of the disease.Additionally outbreaks of various strains of vaccine-derived polio in Somalia Kenya Democratic Republic of Congo Niger Papua New Guinea and Somalia continue to be of "major concern" the committee said given that these viruses have rarely spread across borders.  Vaccine-derived polio occurs when the weakened vaccine virus in the oral polio vaccine is excreted and then spreads in the community according to WHO. The solution for stopping this type of polio is the same as for all polio outbreaks according to WHO: Every child must be immunized several times with the oral vaccine.Many countries remain vulnerable according to WHO. "Gaps in population immunity" including in Western nations would allow the disease to be imported into a nation where polio no longer exists.If polio eradication around the globe is not accomplished in the next couple of years a resurgence of the disease is likely -- much like what is occurring now with measles the WHO emergency committee said. On Thursday WHO reported that measles cases which occurred in all world regions spiked in 2017 and led to an estimated 110000 deaths.   Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly characterized the year-over-year increase in polio cases.,Health
 (CNN)A new study has found that more children in the UK may have been affected by their mothers drinking alcohol while pregnant than previously thought. Research published Friday found that up to 17% of children could have symptoms found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder a group of lifelong conditions caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb. FASD also known as fetal alcohol syndrome can cause a variety of developmental delays and physical symptoms including a smaller head than average poor growth cerebral palsy learning difficulties and autism according to the NHS. To reach their conclusions scientists from the University of Bristol and Cardiff University assessed the development of 13495 children from data in Bristol's Children of the 90s study a population-based cohort study that recruited pregnant women from the southern English city with expected delivery dates between 1991 and 1992.   The Children of the 90s study "also used a range of comprehensive measures like physical tests of growth and psychological assessments" on the children the study's lead researcher Cheryl McQuire from the University of Bristol told CNN. The UK has the fourth highest level of pre-natal alcohol use in the world and various estimates of the disorder in Britain only "looked at a sub-type [of FASD] which is the type with facial symptoms" McQuire said.   "So we know drinking in this country is high but we didn't know the potential number of people who had symptoms from the full FASD" she added. FASD is also considered a relatively hidden disability because most individuals with it do not show physical features. It is also thought to be under-diagnosed in Britain.The research found drinking was common among pregnant women; "79% reported drinking some alcohol during pregnancy with 25% reported of drinking at binge levels" McQuire said. While the screening measures used in the study do not equate to formal diagnoses she said the findings show FASD is more common in the UK than first thought. "If we fail to diagnose it then those affected individuals will continue to be affected by a lack of support and have subsequent impact on them and wider service" Raja Mukherjee a doctor who contributed to the report and runs a diagnostic clinic for FASD said in a statement. "These results can be the first step in helping us in the UK to realise it is no longer a condition we can ignore."The charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service disputed the study's findings arguing only 223 of the 13495 people studied had full data sets the charity said in a press release. It also warned that the findings could cause "undue panic particularly as many pregnancies are unplanned and paves the way for unwarranted and inappropriate interventions" like abortion. Some researchers praised the study but others questioned its use as a guide to how common the condition is in the UK."I would consider this research to be of high quality from a recognized authoritative source" said Christopher Steer of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. "The figure of 17% is certainly strikingly high well above previous indirect indications pointing to levels of between 2% and 5%." "This research provides some potentially very useful information relating to FASD but I really don't think it tells us anything very helpful about how common these conditions are in the UK" said Kevin McConway emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University in London.   "The researchers used a screening tool that they had developed which classified between 6% and 17% of the 13500 children in their study as having symptoms of FASD depending on which exact method they used" he explained.McQuire said the researchers did not want to cause anxiety to pregnant women but were calling for follow-up studies to further clarify the current number of people in the UK with FASD. She also said the best "possible advice" is issued by the UK's chief medical officers which states that women who are pregnant or think they could become pregnant should not drink alcohol at all to keep risks to the baby to a minimum.It also advises that the risk of harm to the baby is "likely to be low if a women has drunk only small amounts of alcohol before she knew she was pregnant or during pregnancy.",Health
London (CNN)Concerns about female genital mutilation or FGM are rising in the UK after the number of children who've had the procedure or are at risk of it more than doubled in the past year.Social workers carrying out assessments in 2017-2018 classified 1960 children as either having undergone or being at risk of FGM.The figure marks a sharp rise from the previous year when 970 cases were identified.The true number of at-risk children is likely to be far higher as the practice remains widely under-reported warned the Local Government Association or LGA which analyzed government records for its findings. The LGA did not offer a reason for the apparent increase in at-risk children but noted that awareness has increased and social workers can identify it quicker than before.Incidents of child abuse related to faith or belief including witchcraft and spirit possession were found to have risen by 12%. Last year there were 1630 cases of such abuse the LGA said an increase from 1460 the year before.The findings demonstrate "the worrying prevalence of FGM which is ruining lives and destroying communities" said Anita Lower of the LGA."At a time when they should be preparing for adult life and enjoying being young no girl or young woman should be subject to the horrors of genital mutilation which is child abuse and cannot be justified for any reason" Lower added.Between April 2017 and March 2018 almost 5000 women and girls in the UK were newly identified as victims of FGM according to the National Health Service.Figures of children identified as being at risk were not collected before 2016-2017 so annual rates can only be compared over the past two years.'Tip of the iceberg'In September FGM survivor and campaigner Leyla Hussein warned that some schoolgirls in the UK were being pressured into FGM by their peers. "Whilst we are making progress in tackling FGM these alarming statistics show it is still being practised in communities across England" said Leethen Bartholomew head of the National FGM Centre which is a joint initiative between the LGA and children's charity Barnardo's."Even more concerning is that these figures are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg because many cases of FGM go undetected" he added.The LGA called for greater funding for social care in order to identify and protect children from the risk of FGM and other forms of abuse."To maximise the effectiveness of this prevention and intervention work children's services departments need further funding to address the scale of demand for help from children and their families" said Lower who is also a councillor for the center-left Liberal Democrat party. The UK government announced an extra £410 million ($523 million) for adult and children's social care in 2019-2020 in its recent budget but the LGA said this "doesn't go far enough to plug the £3 billion ($3.8 billion) funding gap facing children's services by 2025.",Health
 (CNN)Food is one of life's greatest pleasures so with just about every diet I've ever prescribed I've given "permission" for people to incorporate their favorite treats. It's something I make room for in my own daily life and believe others should too.  This concept of eating your favorite treats while on a weight loss plan is often referred to as "cheat meals." But personally I would never think of eating your favorite foods with planned indulgences as "cheating" on your diet. I'm not alone.  "I don't like to use the word 'cheat meal' because I think it connotes that there are good and bad foods" said Martha McKittrick a registered dietitian and health and wellness coach. "You think if you are 'cheating' you are eating a bad food and it sets up a mind game."  "Cheat meals are an indication of not being happy with your diet" added Mascha Davis a registered dietitian in private practice and national media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Changing the word "cheat" to "treat" can make all the difference in the way foods are perceived and can prevent the potential for disordered eating according to experts. But whether you call them "treats" "splurges" or something in between most agree that there are positive aspects of including them in your diet.The benefits of planned indulgencesIncorporating planned indulgences helps to give people something to look forward to especially when following a stringent weight loss plan. And whether it's a piece of cake a scoop of ice cream or a big juicy cheeseburger scheduled splurges can also break up the monotony of restrictive eating which can help you stick to your plan for the long-term."People who treat themselves are giving themselves permission to eat something they enjoy. ... It's not 'off' the plan or 'bad' " McKittrick said. On the flipside forgoing your favorite foods on a regular basis could lead to bingeing on them when you run into say a platter of doughnuts or a buffet table lined with fried foods and desserts.    Davis recommends including portion-controlled treats every day like a piece of dark chocolate after dinner a small portion of chocolate-covered nuts a small oatmeal cookie roasted chickpeas or air-popped popcorn.  "If you love what you eat you will be able to keep the weight off long-term and you don't need to cheat!" Davis said.But changing up a weight loss plan by incorporating whatever it is you desire to eat doesn't work for everyone. "I'll say to clients 'do you want to have one meal a week that you can enjoy and not have to worry about being on the plan?'  A lot of my clients want it but others don't want to go there. ... They just want to stick to the plan" McKittrick said."If you are really restrictive on a 1200-calorie diet and you want to eat a little bit of your favorite meal it's hard to stop" said David Levitsky professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University.In some cases including even a small treat on a daily basis could trigger overeating. "If someone could have a forkful of dessert every night that's fine but for others I honestly believe it sets them off" McKittrick said.  "I have tons of patients who can have a small amount of dark chocolate every day but if I had box of chocolate in front of me I couldn't have just one. Everyone is different and you have to know your own body." Considerations for treat mealsThe decision to include treat meals as well as how often and what to eat can vary from person to person. If you decide to incorporate treat meals into your eating plan here are some considerations to keep in mind:Lose the guiltFeeling bad or guilty about indulging not only denies you pleasure it can lead to emotionally driven eating which can lead to weight gain and set you up for a poor relationship with food.  Think about it this way: A single treat or meal will not derail your diet but your response to eating the treat can cause you to lose control and fall off the wagon."Guilt will eventually bring you down. ... It can snowball into a negative conversation in your head. ... You beat yourself up and say 'why did I do that?'  And then you say 'now I might as well eat all of this' ... and all of this erodes at your self-esteem" McKittrick said.   Consider the timingFor some people starting a diet plan by incorporating a daily or weekly treat meal makes sense.  But others would rather hold off until an initial goal is reached.  "One guy I counseled lost 80 pounds. ... He's been on a fairly rigid plan -- mostly fruit protein and vegetables -- but this is what he wanted.  Now he's excited about taking one day a week to have three pieces of pizza or whatever he desires ... and he's excited about it and looking forward to it" McKittrick said.Don't turn a 'cheat' snack or meal into a 'cheat' day"There's nothing magical about 'cheating' " Levitsky said.  "If you think you are getting away with something and you can 'cheat' more frequently the rate of weight loss will go down."One of McKittrick's patients gave himself an entire day to splurge.  "He was super-rigid all week long but on Sundays he ate nonstop for the whole day."  Though he lost some weight initially his weight loss came to a halt because his strict days were simply making up for his Sunday binge. "We changed it to one treat meal ... and now he's losing a steady 2 pounds a week." Be true to your indulgences It's important to choose foods you really enjoy. That means a cheeseburger made with lean sirloin and one slice of cheese on a small whole-wheat bun might not cut it if you're really craving Shake Shack. Similarly fruit would probably not satisfy you if you really want ice cream or a piece of candy.In addition to knowing what treat meals are worth incorporating into your plan it's important to know how much of that treat will work for you. For one person a treat meal might be eating a big bowl of pasta at their favorite restaurant one night per week whereas someone else could be happy with a couple of forkfuls of their spouse's pasta each night McKittrick explained.  Try making your favorite foods healthier Experts say that although you shouldn't shortchange yourself when it comes to eating what you crave you can still try to make it more nutritionally valuable.  "Pizza can be made healthier if you order a whole-grain crust add a lot of veggies and order half the cheese. And ice cream can be a better choice if you get a sorbet or eat a healthy meal and then enjoy some real ice cream for dessert" Davis said.  "There is a better version of almost any 'cheat meal.'

 (CNN)Reminiscent of a scene from "The Social Network" the whiteboard in researcher and professor Morgan Levine's Yale Medical School office is covered in a series of letters and numbers. She clicks the red cap back onto the dry erase marker and steps back to admire her work. In front of her the equation stretches across multiple lines taking up much of the surface. This algorithm represents a new way of thinking about age. "In my lab we work on a lot of different types of aging measures" Levine said. "One of the most recent ones is based on blood measures you get at your normal doctor's appointment. We basically take those and combine them using different algorithms to get what we call someone's phenotypic age or biological age." Essentially everyone has two ages: a chronological age how old the calendar says you are and a phenotypic or biological age basically the age at which your body functions as it compares to average fitness or health levels."People of the same chronological age aren't all at the same risk for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer or even dying" Levine said. "What [the biological age] does is actually give us a better idea of where someone stands for their age.""Chronological age isn't how old we really are. It's a superficial number" said professor David Sinclair co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School. "We all age biologically at different rates according to our genes what we eat how much we exercise and what environmental toxins we are exposed to. Biological age is what determines our health and ultimately our lifespan. Biological age is number of candles we really should be blowing out. In the future with advances in our ability to control biological age we may have even fewer candles on our cake than the previous one."Levine and her team identified nine biomarkers taken in a simple blood test that seemed to be the most influential on lifespan. The biomarkers include blood sugar kidney and liver measures and immune and inflammatory measures. Levine plugs those numbers into the computer and the algorithm does the rest.People with a biological age lower than their chronological age have a lower mortality risk while those aging older from a biological standpoint have a higher mortality risk and are potentially more prone to developing the diseases associated with the higher age range. But perhaps what's most important here -- unlike results from genetic testing -- is that these are measures that can be changed. Doctors can take this information and empower patients to make changes to lifestyle diet exercise and sleep habits and hopefully take steps to lower the risk and improve their biological age. "I think the most exciting thing about this research is that these things aren't set in stone" Levine said. "We actually know a lot about how to change some of these markers. I think we are given the information much earlier in the process hopefully before someone ever develops disease and then they can really take steps to improve their health before its too late."Levine who has been fascinated with aging ever since she was a young girl even entered her own numbers into the algorithm. She was surprised by the results."I always considered myself a very healthy person" she said. "I'm physically active; I eat what I consider to a fairly healthy diet. I did not find my results to be as good as I had hope they would be."She now tries to get more sleep and changed her diet and exercise routine. "It was a wake-up call" she said. Levine is  working with a group to provide access to the algorithm online  so that anyone can calculate their biological age identify potential risks and take the steps to help their own health in the long run."No one wants to live an extremely long life when they are in very poor health and have a lot of chronic disease" Levine said. By delaying the onset of diseases and cognitive and physical functioning problems "people can still be engaged in society" she said. "I think that is the ideal we should be striving for.",Health
 (CNN)Measles cases around the world surged 31% from 2016 to 2017 according to a new report jointly published by the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Measles outbreaks occurred in all regions WHO said because of gaps in vaccine coverage. There were an estimated 110000 deaths due to measles in 2017."Since 2016 measles incidence has increased globally and in five of the six WHO regions" the report says although this was in part because more countries reported on the virus. The Western Pacific Region which includes countries such as Australia and Japan was the only region to report a decrease in cases from 2016 to 2017. It's also the only region to achieve and sustain 95% or greater coverage of the first dose of the measles vaccine since 2006. Measles a viral illness can be prevented through two doses of a vaccine and measles vaccination prevented an estimated 21.1 million deaths from 2000 to 2017 according to the report.Vaccine coverage increased globally from an estimated 72% to 85% from 2000 to 2017 according to the report but that's far short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. Coverage for the first vaccine "has stagnated for nearly a decade" the report said.Estimated coverage of the second dose of the measles vaccine increased globally from 15% in 2000 to 67% in 2017 the report said. As of July endemic measles was re-established in Venezuela leading to outbreaks in bordering countries; the region had been declared free of endemic measles in 2016.In 2017 the European Region declared "the reestablishment of endemic measles virus transmission in the Russian Federation and in Germany" even though it had verified elimination in 37 other countries. "The measles resurgence in Europe has likely led to reestablished endemic measles in some EUR countries" the report says. Dr. Seth Berkley CEO of Gavi the Vaccine Alliance said in a statement "The increase in measles cases is deeply concerning but not surprising. Complacency about the disease and the spread of falsehoods about the vaccine in Europe a collapsing health system in Venezuela and pockets of fragility and low immunization coverage in Africa are combining to bring about a global resurgence of measles after years of progress. "Existing strategies need to change: more effort needs to go into increasing routine immunization coverage and strengthening health systems. Otherwise we will continue chasing one outbreak after another.",Health
 (CNN)A British lawmaker revealed in Parliament on Thursday that he is HIV-positive. Lloyd Russell-Moyle a member of Parliament for the opposition Labour Party is believed to be the only sitting lawmaker in the House of Commons to have disclosed that he has the virus. "Next year I'll be marking an anniversary of my own: 10 years since I became HIV-positive" the 32-year-old told the lower house. "It's been a long journey -- from the fear to acceptance and from today advocacy knowing my treatment keeps me healthy and that it protects any partner I have."Taking medication for a number of years has made him "what the [National Health Service] calls HIV-positive 'undetectable' " he said. Russell-Moyle who was elected in 2017 explained that means he does not get sick and "can't transmit HIV to someone else.""So as the virus lays undetectable and dormant in my body; my medication ensures that the virus doesn't reactivate doesn't progress and can't be passed on. That's why the NHS says: Undetectable equals un-transmittable."The MP told the Press Association news agency that he "had a duty as a Member of Parliament" to make the disclosure. He said government cuts to sexual health budgets meant he could not "keep quiet" any more about an issue that "not only affects people I know but it affects me so personally." The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment.Russell-Moyle added that he chose the timing of his announcement to mark the 30th World AIDS Day on December 1.He is the second lawmaker to disclose that he is living with HIV. Former Labour Cabinet minister Chris Smith made the first revelation in 2005. When someone is HIV-positive regular treatment can nearly eliminate their chance of spreading the infection to others during sex.Also Thursday Public Health England reported that the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK fell 17% between 2016 and 2017.An estimated 92% of the 102000 people living with HIV in Britain have been diagnosed the agency said. Of those 98% are on treatment and 97% of those on treatment are virally suppressed meaning HIV is undetectable in their blood.  The figures make the UK one of the first countries to reach the UN's 90-90-90 targets: 90% of people with HIV will have a diagnosis by 2020 90% of those will receive antiretrovirals and 90% of those will have viral suppression.About 39 million people were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2017 according to UNAIDS the United Nations program that sets international targets.,Health
 (CNN)The UK has exceeded UN targets for HIV diagnosis and treatment proving efforts to control the epidemic can work.The number of people newly diagnosed with the infection fell by 17% from 5280 in 2016 to 4363 in 2017.An estimated 92% of the of 102000 people living with HIV in Britain have been diagnosed according to Public Health England (PHE). Of those 98% are on treatment and 97% of those on treatment are virally suppressed meaning HIV is undetectable in their blood.  The figures make the UK one of the first countries to reach the UN's 90-90-90 targets which urge countries to achieve a 90% success rate in the diagnosis treatment and viral suppression of HIV the health body says."Many of us will remember a time when an HIV positive result was effectively a death sentence. Today's report is a poignant and powerful reminder of how far we've come" UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in a statement. "Now in the UK almost everyone with HIV is not only diagnosed and in treatment but living long healthy lives -- and we're one of just a handful of countries to meet these ambitious UN targets."The UK figures contrast sharply with the alarming findings of a report published earlier this week which found "disproportionately higher" rates of HIV diagnoses in Eastern Europe than in the West.The improved results in the UK were put down to increased HIV testing higher rates of condom use and a reduction in the time between diagnosis and starting treatment. The availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP is also thought to have had an impact. PrEP involves the use daily pills -- usually antiretroviral drugs -- to reduce the risk of contracting HIV through sex and has been shown to be up to 90% effective according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But more can be done -- an estimated 43% of new HIV diagnoses in 2017 were made at a late stage of infection the UK figures showed."There can be no doubt prevention efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the UK are working" said Professor Noel Gill Head of STIs & HIV at Public Health England. "Our efforts must continue apace in order to eliminate HIV. With an estimated 8000 people still unaware of their infection it is vital that people seek out an HIV test if they consider themselves at risk or accept the offer of an HIV test by a healthcare professional as early diagnosis is key to stopping transmission."The UK results represent a "great achievement" said Sarah Fidler professor of HIV and communicable diseases at Imperial College London who was not involved with the report.She praised the work of British health agencies which have "harnessed resources media advocacy and messaging around HIV testing.""The challenge we now face is how to ensure we can sustain these services in the UK" Fidler added. "If we are to maintain the momentum we cannot afford complacency. Any reduction in HIV prevention or the care of patients with HIV threatens these amazing achievements."Around 39 million people were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2017 according to UNAIDS the United Nations program that sets international targets.Globally about 75% of people living with HIV/AIDs were diagnosed the group says.,Health
 (CNN)Pictures and video of migrant men women and children rushing through white clouds of tear gas fired by border agents during an incident at the southern US border have brought forth anger debate and concern. "I was holding my child pretty much like my child had fainted from the gas" said Jessica a migrant from Honduras who daughter was overwhelmed by the tear gas. The decision to use the gas was "in direct response to our agents being attacked" said Robert E. Perez Deputy Commissioner for US Customs and Border Protection. "It was a very dynamic and very dangerous situation. It is very unfortunate to me that we had a situation where folks who were particularly vulnerable -- children and females -- chose to immerse themselves in that type of an unlawful activity."Meanwhile some observers have worried about the effects the substance could have on the young migrant children who were seen in the fray. According to experts tear gas isn't exactly what you think it is -- and it does in fact have the potential to have a dangerous and long-lasting effect on children. Tear gas is more than an irritant What exactly is tear gas? While there are a few different compounds that can be used for the purpose the overwhelmingly common compound is called chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile or "CS." Tear gas is often assumed to be an irritant like the fumes of an onion in the eyes or pepper in the nose. Recent medical research has proven otherwise says Sven Eric Jordt an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University who specializes in sensory mechanisms"We discovered that the chemical causes pain by activating pain receptors" Jordt says. I would consider them to be nerve agents that selectively and very potently engage pain nerves." Children are especially vulnerable to its effects The Centers for Disease Control says tear gas can cause blurred vision burning and swelling in the nose coughing choking shortness of breath and skin burns in addition to other side effects. According to the CDC most of these effects go away after 15 to 30 minutes -- if the person is decontaminated. That's a key step because Jordt points out that tear gas isn't a gas at all but rather a solid; a powder that has to be heated and mixed with a solvent. "That's why they can deposit on the skin hair eyes and clothing" he says. "If [people] are not decontaminated this can cause injuries."Children are at an even higher risk for injuries -- both at the time of exposure and later on. "Children are especially at risk because tear gas is heavier than air" says Jordt. "It is present in higher concentrations closer to the ground and children being shorter are exposed to higher concentrations. Also since their lungs are smaller when they inhale tear gas the potential for injury is higher."It affects their long term healthThese reasons were echoed in a statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics condemning the use of tear gas on migrant families. "The use of tear gas on children -- including infants and toddlers in diapers --  goes against evidence-based recommendations and threatens their short and long-term health" the statement written by AAP President Colleen A. Kraft reads."Children are uniquely vulnerable to physiological effects of chemical agents. A child's smaller size more frequent number of breaths per minute and limited cardiovascular stress response compared to adults magnifies the harm of agents such as tear gas."The AAP also alludes to possible psychological trauma since children who have arrived at the border "have taken harrowing journeys.""We must make every effort not to retraumatize them" Kraft writes. And those long-term effects are serious In addition to burns and respiratory problems directly after the fact researchers have recognized several possible long-term health risks for those who have been exposed to tear gas. "There have been many cases in which exposed people were hospitalized due to lung injuries that take quite a while to heal; days or weeks" says Jordt. In 2012 researchers observed the health of US Army recruits during the riot control portion of their basic training. They found those who were exposed to the CS chemical "had a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed with ARI [acute respiratory illnesses] following exposure" than those who had not yet been exposed to the chemical. Other studies that focused on children specifically found connections between tear gas exposure and serious respiratory problems. A 1972 study documented the health of an infant who was exposed to tear gas and subsequently developed a persistent case of pneumonitis an inflammation of the walls of the lungs.CNN's Leyla Santiago contributed to this report from Tijuana Mexico. ,Health
 (CNN)The UK has a higher death rate from respiratory illnesses than other developed Western nations according to a new study.Deaths from all respiratory diseases except lung cancer were higher compared with 14 countries within the European Union and Norway Canada Australia and the United States says the analysis of data from the World Health Organization.Overall fatalities from respiratory diseases have been decreasing across all these countries between 1985 and 2015 according to the analysis published Wednesday in the BMJ. Mortality in men was reduced in this period but it remained approximately the same for women.Respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease known as COPD are categorized as amenable diseases says Dr. Justin Salciccioli a resident and clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School and lead researcher on the analysis. "The relevance of that is that with effective timely and appropriate health care delivery these deaths should be avoidable" he added.The UK has been identified as an outlier on this issue with work like an analysis of the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study pointing out that it has higher mortality rates for COPD a disease that was responsible for 3.17 million deaths globally in 2015. Some of the main risk factors for COPD are smoking and air pollution. The international research team led by Salciccioli goes beyond previous studies as it looks at whether these trends persist over a longer period and over a broad category of diseases.In the UK deaths from respiratory diseases from 1985 to 2015 fell from 151 per 100000 men to 89; for women the results went from 67 to 68 per 100000 according to the new study. In the other countries studied death rates for men fell from 108 to 69 per 100000 in this period; rates for women went from 35 to 37 per 100000. Salciccioli described the national comparisons as "a big difference." "That is one of the big reasons that we've pursued this question" he added.The difference seems to affect a broader category of diseases that affect the lung in general according to Salciccioli."The cause for concern would be that this is a difference that persists over time more than an absolute difference" he said.Salciccioli explained that with respect to deaths in men with lung cancer the UK is "just as good if not better" as the majority of comparator countries.The study shows an observational trend and is not able to determine why there is a difference in death rates but it is possible that lifestyle factors like smoking play a role Salciccioli said.Salciccioli hopes that the study will lead to a better understanding of what lies behind the differences between British mortality rates and those of other countries.Previous researched has suggested that high tobacco consumption in the UK could be linked to differences in mortality from respiratory diseases. But smoking has been on the decline in the UK the study says.Pollution could be another possible explanation the report's authors added. A 2017 WHO study reported 25.7 deaths per 100000 people in the UK attributable to household and ambient air pollution a greater rate than in most comparator countries according to the WHO data.All countries studied showed a decrease in male mortality from respiratory conditions but no sign of a decrease in female rates. Salciccioli believes that this is driven "by the legacy of smoking": Men had historically higher rates of smoking and there have been significant improvements in reducing these. Salciccioli is not sure that smoking rates were cut among women as much as they have in men.Respiratory diseases are a large burden on health services the study says. In 2016 they were among the top five killers globally according to the Global Disease Burden report."These figures are sad but they're not surprising" said Dr. Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation who was not involved in the study. "We know that lung disease is the third biggest killer in the UK after cancer and heart disease.",Health

 (CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration approved two cancer treatments Vitrakvi and Xospata this week after expedited reviews.Vitrakvi approved Monday is "a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker)."The FDA said in a statement that it is the second approved cancer treatment that is based on a tumor biomarker instead of the place in the body where the tumor originated. Vitrakvi will be used for the treatment of solid tumors that have an NTRK (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase) gene fusion that do not have a known resistance mutation that are not metastatic or where surgical removal is likely to lead to severe morbidity and that have no alternative treatments or have progressed after treatments. NTRK genes are rare but occur in many types of cancer the FDA said such as mammary analogue secretory carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma. Xospata tablets approved Wednesday are for the "treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation" according to the FDA. Alongside the tablets the agency also approved a diagnostic to detect the mutation. "Approximately 25 to 30 percent of patients with AML have a mutation in the FLT3 gene. These mutations are associated with a particularly aggressive form of the disease and a higher risk of relapse" Dr. Richard Pazdur director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence said in the statement. AML is a rapidly progressing cancer that affects the numbers of normal blood cells and calls for continuous transfusions the FDA said. Both treatments were granted Priority Review designation.  Priority Review established in 1992 means the FDA aims to review the drug or treatment within six months opposed to 10 months for a standard review. "A Priority Review designation will direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of applications for drugs that if approved would be significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions when compared to standard applications" the FDA says. Both treatments also received orphan drug designation a status granted to drugs for rare diseases or conditions.,Health
 (CNN)Are you constantly failing the "sniff test" in which you surreptitiously blow into your cupped hands to check for stinky breath? (Tip: If you can smell it then your breath is flat-out noxious as most of us can't tell on our own dentists say.)If your mouth funk rates as "stank-nasty" then you -- and all those around you -- are victims of halitosis breath that smells so repulsive it could only be attractive to buzzards and flies. You're not alone. Up to 80 million people have chronic bad breath according to the Academy of General Dentistry.Besides the obvious impact on your popularity bad breath can be a sign of diseases and conditions some serious.While you race for a mint it might help to know the top 10 reasons why your breath smells bad in the first place and what you can do about it.1.    You stink at brushing.Yes poor dental care is a leading cause of bad breath. When food is trapped between your teeth and under your gums bacteria get busy breaking it down leaving behind putrid gases that smell like rotten eggs or worse (even as bad as poop).  One way to tell if you have bad breath dentists say is to floss and then smell the thread. If there's a rank smell on the floss you'll know for sure your breath is toxic.The good news is that you can easily fix this type of bad breath by brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day and flossing regularly.  While the brush is in there don't forget your tongue and cheeks; studies show that brushing them can reduce bacteria load.Cosmetic mouthwashes and gum only temporarily cover up the stink dentists warn because neither reduces bacteria. 2.    You ate or drank something smelly.Coffee. Garlic. Fish. Eggs. Onions. Spicy food. The foods we eat can easily cause bad breath. Many of the foods that contribute to stinky breath do so by releasing sulfides. Sulfur as you know smells like rotten eggs. A mint or stick of gum might mask the reek but be warned: Odors from some of what you eat can stick around until the food works its way through your system -- even if you brush. According to the Academy of General Dentistry the allyl methyl sulfide in coffee onions and garlic can stay in your bloodstream and be expelled via your breath up to 72 hours after consumption.Try fighting back with other foods such as lemons parsley and crisp fruits and veggies such as apples or carrots that stimulate saliva production which your mouth relies on to wash away impurities. Drinking water helps too! Caffeine on the other hand slows the production of saliva.  3.    You eat a lot of sweets.Before you plop that next sugary candy cake or cookie in your pie hole listen closely. You might hear the chorus of cheers coming from the bacteria that live in your mouth. For them sugar is a superfood and boy do they have a party gobbling it down leaving a stink behind.Dentists say sticky candies such as gummies and caramels are the worst offenders; if you must eat something sweet they suggest (oh joy!) plain chocolate. It has less sugar than many other candies and dissolves more quickly in the mouth.4.    You're on a low-carb diet.Eating a lot of protein and few carbs forces your body into ketosis when your system begins to burn fat cells for energy. The process creates waste products called ketones. Too many of those aren't good so your body has no choice but to make you a walking stank house excreting ketones via your urine and your breath. It's a rank odor which many compare to rotten fruit.Try drinking extra water to flush ketones out of your body. If you use breath mints candies or gum be sure they are sugar-free.5.    You're a mouth breather.At night saliva production is decreased which is why many of us wake up with a rotten taste (and smell) in our mouths even after diligent brushing and flossing.Mouth breathing or snoring such as from sleep apnea further dries out the mouth making your breath even more foul. Called xerostomia dry mouth is not only unpleasant but potentially harmful. You might develop a sore throat hoarseness difficulty speaking and swallowing problems wearing dentures and even a change in your sense of taste.The solution: Get to the bottom of your mouth breathing problems and fix them while drinking lots of water and keeping up your dental hygiene both morning and night.Of course dentists also suggest regular checkups. Don't be shy or embarrassed. If you tell your dentist about your persistent problem he or she may be able to help pinpoint the cause.6.    Your medications are partly to blame.Hundreds of commonly used medications can dry out your mouth contributing to rank breath. Some of the most common culprits are meds that treat anxiety depression high blood pressure pain and muscle tension.Check the drug's list of side effects to see whether dry mouth is on it and then talk to your doctor about switching to a medication that doesn't reduce saliva.7.    You've got a stuffy nose or allergies.Do you have chronic sinus infections? Respiratory illnesses? As your nose gets stuffy you're more likely to be breathing through your mouth drying out tissues and reducing saliva flow. If you have allergies the struggle to stop the constant drip-drip-drip with an antihistamine can lead to bad breath as well. Many of the prescription and over-the-counter meds used to combat colds flu and allergies dry up more than just the nose. And all that postnasal drip can cause a stink by ending up stuck on the back of your tongue which is incredibly hard to reach with a toothbrush. Dentists recommend scraping the back of your tongue with a specially designed scraper and rinsing with a mouthwash containing chlorine dioxide. 8.    You smoke or chew tobacco (or other things).If you're a smoker you probably have no idea how the odor of tobacco clings to your clothes and belongings and especially your breath. Breathing in hot fumes dulls your senses diminishing your ability to smell and taste. Obviously hot air will also dry the mouth. The loss of saliva combined with the odor of tobacco creates the infamous "smoker's breath." Cottonmouth is also a typical side effect of smoking or ingesting weed a growing scenario across the country as more states legalize cannabis. Chawing tobacky? It's a no-brainer that your teeth will stain your gums will suffer and your breath will stink.The solution? You know.9.    You drink alcohol.Yup we're still talking about things that dry out the mouth. That my wine-loving beer-drinking cocktail-imbibing friends includes alcohol. Not to mention wine contains sugar as do many of the mixers used to create cocktails. Cue the cheering crowds of bacteria.Fight back by sucking on sugar-free candies or chewing sugar-free gum as both stimulate saliva production. Don't forget to drink water (it's also good in preventing hangovers) and brush and floss as soon as you can.But here's an irony: A lot of mouthwashes and rinses contain alcohol. So if Hal. E. Tosis won't leave you alone talk to your dentist about using a therapeutic mouthwash designed to reduce plaque instead.10.    You have an underlying medical condition.Do you have heartburn acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease? Puking up a bit of food or acid into your mouth can easily create bad breath. Don't write that off as just gross; untreated GERD can easily develop into a serious illness even cancer. Bad breath can also be an early sign of an underlying disease that may not have outward symptoms.One of the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis a life-threatening condition that affects mostly people with Type 1 diabetes is fruity-smelling breath. It occurs because people with no to little insulin cannot metabolize ketone acids allowing them to build up to toxic levels in the blood.  Sweet-smelling breath in a person with Type 1 diabetes should trigger prompt medical action. In rare cases people with Type 2 diabetes can also develop the condition.People with severe chronic kidney failure can have breath with an ammonia-like odor which the US National Library of Medicine says can also be described as "urine-like or 'fishy."A sign of liver disease is fetor hepaticus a strong sweet musty odor on the breath. It occurs because a diseased liver cannot fully process limonene a chemical found in citrus peels and some plants. Scientists are trying to develop a breath test based on the smell that can alert doctors to early stage cirrhosis of the liver thus triggering treatment.,Health
 (CNN)As the US Food and Drug Administration publicizes its plans to overhaul the process for manufacturers that want to market medical devices in the United States a year-long investigation by a nonprofit newsroom is reporting more than 80000 deaths potentially linked to medical implants since 2008. Despite the timing the FDA denies any connection between its communications and the report from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists."We didn't even know about what the ICIJ was doing until early October" FDA spokeswoman Deborah Kotz said Tuesday. She added that the agency issued its Medical Device Safety Action Plan in April laying out what it has done and what new steps it plans to take to enhance device safety. "These actions are things that we've been working on for quite a while" Kotz said.Still the concurrent release of information from the government regulator and the investigative team highlights the many challenges and missteps related to patient safety. Thousands of devices"The FDA regulates more than 190000 different devices which are manufactured by more than 18000 firms in more than 21000 medical device facilities worldwide" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Jeff Shuren director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health said in a statement last week announcing the agency's plans. "On average we approve clear or grant marketing authorization to approximately 12 new or modified devices every business day after carefully determining -- based on valid scientific evidence -- that the devices are safe and effective."Meanwhile the journalism collaboration which included more than 250 journalists based in 36 countries examined more than 8 million device-related health records including death and injury reports.  Called the "Implant Files" the extensive analysis of pacemakers insulin pumps breast implants spinal cord stimulators and other surgically embedded appliances and materials found nearly 83000 deaths and more than 1.7 million injuries possibly linked to medical devices and reported in the United States alone since 2008. Over the past decade manufacturers have also paid out at least $1.6 billion to settle charges of regulatory violations including corruption and fraud around the world according to the consortium which published its analysis Sunday."Patients around the world have become unwitting test subjects for new medical technology" the consortium said. "Often following the trusted advice of their doctors they have been injured maimed and killed by poorly-tested implants."Nathan Cortez a professor and associate dean for research at Southern Methodist University Law School explained that "the process for FDA to review medical devices was established by Congress in 1976." He noted that in the 42 years since "a lot of new medical devices" have been introduced into the US market."What the general public probably doesn't understand is that many medical devices allowed on the market haven't received much in-depth scrutiny from the FDA" Cortez who was not involved in the consortium's work or the FDA's plans wrote in an email. "Some have; but most haven't."For well over a decade the FDA has had to listen to critiques from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) as well as academics members of Congress and manufacturers" he wrote.What is the FDA tasked only with protecting American patients doing to improve its own performance? A big element of its plan is "trying to implement a more active surveillance system to learn more about medical device problems" Kotz said.  This system is known as NEST the National Evaluation System for health Technology. FDA wants an active not passive surveillance capabilityFrequently the FDA learns about device risk through the existing passive reporting system by which doctors hospitals manufacturers and patients can post problems to an agency database according to Kotz. "We analyze those and if we see a signal we can take action: We can ask the company to do a recall; we can issue a change of labeling a safety communication."But there are limits to this "passive reporting" system she said. "A lot of the time there's under-reporting and we don't necessarily get a real-time look at what's happening. So we're trying to switch to this active system that we call NEST."NEST relies on real-world evidence including anonymized information from insurance claims patient registries and electronic health records Kotz said. Combing through this data the FDA would be able to see in real time which devices might be causing problems. Another important component of NEST is the Unique Device Identification system in which devices are marked with a specific code and if a particular device model or batch of medical devices malfunction or become contaminated the FDA can pull it from the market. NEST if funded by Congress will help the FDA in its efforts to monitor the general medical device industry yet device therapies unique to women's health require additional surveillance systems Gottlieb and Shuren said. They noted that "the President's budget for fiscal year 2019 includes a request for an additional $46 million" to support NEST.Women's health in the spotlightTherapies unique to women including treatments for uterine fibroids pelvic floor disorder female sterilization and long-acting reversible contraception will become the focus of the FDA Gottlieb and Shuren said. To evaluate real-world data on the safety and performance of medical products the FDA will strengthen its Coordinated Registry Networks and separately its National Breast Implant Registry. "We've heard from patients who are concerned that their implants may be linked to other health conditions like chronic fatigue cognitive issues and muscle pain" Gottlieb and Shuren said. Another FDA concern is the "growing number" of manufacturers marketing "vaginal rejuvenation" devices to treat conditions and symptoms related to menopause urinary incontinence or sexual function.  Finally the FDA will convene an advisory committee in February to discuss the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal pelvic organ prolapse repair. The meeting will provide an opportunity for the agency to hear from the public about their experiences.Kotz said the FDA is committed to modernizing its 510(k) approval process the regulatory pathway undertaken by manufacturers submitting new devices to the agency. "We're planning to finalize this guidance early next year and will rename this new approach the 'Safety and Performance-Based Pathway' to reflect its focus on advancing improved safety and performance of new products" Kotz said. The FDA's overhaul of its approval process may be too late for many patients according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. "If a drug goes wrong patients can stop taking it. Many implanted devices are installed adjacent to vital organs or pressed against sensitive nerves meaning removal may carry risks of serious injury or death" the consortium notes. "Nearly 500000 reports over the last decade describe explant surgeries in connection with a medical device."Cortez said the FDA's modernization program "looks like the agency is trying to turn 510(k) reviews into a more rigorous process. Although we've seen hints of this coming for a few years the new programs are important.",Health
 (CNN)Thanks to "Sex and the City" we're all familiar with the phrase "he's just not that into you." Yet many couples who are no longer all that into each other choose to stay together anyway. Why do people choose to remain in unhappy relationships? According to a recent pair of studies the more people believe their partner is dependent on the relationship the less likely they are to initiate a breakup. In other words you might be motivated to stay in an unfulfilling relationship for the sake of your partner.I asked some of my colleagues to share more about why unhappy couples stick together -- and how you can end a relationship a little less painfully if you choose to break up.Staying together can be selfless -- or selfish The recent studies suggest that people stay in unsatisfying relationships because they're concerned about hurting their partner's feelings. "In my experience there are most often underlying fears and insecurities that prevent people from moving forward into a life that might be less comfortable but ultimately happier and more authentic. These couples tend to settle into a 'good enough' relationship" sex therapist Holly Richmond said. "But there is almost always a point where it's obvious that not good enough is truly not good enough and it causes more harm to the unhappy person to stay than it would to their partner if they left."Concerns about children finances friends lifestyle  and standing in the community can also influence the decision to stay together. "In my practice I see clients who stay in relationships because they're worried they won't find another partner while others remain because they don't want to deprive their children from having the other parent in their day-to-day life" sex therapist Sari Cooper said. But staying in an unhappy relationship doesn't do anyone any favors sex therapist Kristen Lilla said. "Staying because you don't want to hurt someone else is selfish because it takes away the other person's agency to make a decision" she explained. "You are deciding that your partner will not be OK without you so you stay with them out of pity."Should you stay or should you go?Clearly the decision to end a relationship can be a difficult one for many people. It can be helpful to visualize your life after the breakup Cooper said. "I ask clients to imagine in great detail what their life would be like: Will they able to support themselves financially? Will they feel that they did all they could to improve the relationship? Will they face a loss of a community in addition to the relationship?"Sex therapist Kristie Overstreet agreed. "If you're trying to decide whether to stay in the relationship or leave it write out the pros and cons of the decision. This forces you to use logic versus emotions and helps you identify things that you wouldn't have realized before" she explained. "One of the most important questions you can ask yourself is if you have done everything you could do from your end to make it work. Make sure you have checked off all of the boxes on your list which will help you come to your decision."You might also try picturing your relationship as a box that's large enough for both of you to move around comfortably within the space with each of you supporting one another's growth. "An unhealthy relationship means that the relationship box you are in is too small for each of you to be independent and separate and you feel lost and frightened without the other person" sex therapist Tammy Nelson said. "You may have been taught that this is what true love is -- a soul mate that is your other half -- but this is really codependency. If you don't have enough room to grow as a whole person in a relationship you may not only be holding yourself back but your partner as well."Breaking up is hard to doThere's certainly some truth to this cliché: "There's no way to break up with someone without the risk of hurting them" sex therapist Deborah Fox said. That said Fox stresses it's important to be honest with your partner about why you want to end the relationship. "Although it's not necessary to include every reason you should end a relationship with integrity which means with honesty" she explained. "Little white lies can be justified in a short barely-off-the-ground relationship but not in one of any length."Overstreet agreed. "You can't prevent your partner from hurting over your decision. However being truthful and respectful during the process will help lessen hurt" she said. "The way you handle yourself and your words are the only things you have control over. Remember that you have to do whatever you need to so that you remain healthy -- and leaving an unhealthy relationship is one of the steps in that direction."The choice to break up is rarely an easy one but by putting the time and thought into the decision you can make things a little easier -- both for you and for your partner.Ian Kerner is a licensed couples therapist writer and contributor on the topic of sex for CNN. ,Health
 (CNN)The average global temperature is much higher and rising more rapidly than "anything modern civilization has experienced" according to David Easterling one of the authors of a new US government report that delivers a dire warning about our future.Thousands more could die food will be scarcer and the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or in the worst-case scenario more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.Released Friday the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1000 people including 300 leading scientists roughly half from outside the government. It comes from  the US Global Change Research Program a team of 13 federal agencies and is the second of two volumes. The first released in November 2017 concluded that there is "no convincing alternative explanation" for the changing climate other than "human activities especially emissions of greenhouse gases."The report breaks down the possible impact of climate change by US region and looks at the effects climate change will have on health economy and infrastructure. Here are some of its key predictions:1. Crop production will decline.Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of crops will decline across the United States due to higher temperatures drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest farms will be able to produce only about 75% of the corn they produce today and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybeans. By 2100 higher temperatures in places like Yolo County California could make it too hot to cultivate walnuts. Climate change could also severely limit almond production in California.2. Cows could have it bad.Heat stress which cost the dairy industry $1.2 billion in 2010 will become an even bigger issue potentially causing average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years. Livestock for meat could struggle to find plants to graze on and heat stress could impact their numbers. 3. Food sources from the sea will decline.There won't be as many oysters shrimp or crab due to ocean acidification. The report predicts a $230 million loss for that industry by the end of the century. Annual oyster harvests in the Southeast will decline by 46% under the worst-case scenario by the end of the century.Fish stocks overall may decline as red tides -- algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- become more common. It was a red tide that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August.The coral reefs that support diverse fish life off the Florida Keys are already declining and could be lost in the coming decades due to higher temperatures.River fish could also die off; higher temperatures have already led to die-offs due to proliferative kidney disease. Warmer temperatures were a problem for endangered sockeye salmon and Chinook in the Columbia River when they suffered a serious die-off in 2015. 4. Food- and waterborne illness will spread.Weather that is bad for farmers is good for spreading food- and waterborne diseases and more people will be exposed to them.Marine toxins and pathogens will contaminate seafood. The waterborne bacteria Vibrio which is already causing thousands of illnesses a year will expand to seafood in northern seas and affect oysters grown in the Northeast.Floods and heavy rains that can cause sewers to overflow can contaminate drinking water leading to more stomach problems studies have shown. Droughts could cause more skin and eye infections due to lack of water for personal hygiene. Other waterborne diseases that could spread include hepatitis A salmonellosis shigellosis typhoid and E. coli.5. Bugs will bug us more.Weather that's bad for crops is good for bugs.Mosquitoes and ticks love warmer and wetter temperatures. That means diseases such as dengue chikungunya and Zika will be more widespread. West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures. The Northeast could see more cases of Lyme disease as the tick season expands in states like Maine and Pennsylvania.6. It will be hard to breathe.Asthma and allergies will also be worse due to climate change. The pollen season will intensify and lengthen in parts of the United States due to warmer temperatures. Oak pollen in the Midwest will send more people to the emergency room for asthma costing up to $170000 annually according to the report.Urban areas with higher concentrations of CO2 will see more allergy-causing plants such as ragweed growing faster.Increased rain in some areas will encourage mold growth indoors which can make asthma symptoms worse.7. Mental health will be challenged.Extreme weather can have serious mental health consequences and lead to post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety and depression.Exposure to extreme heat for instance is associated with aggressive behavior suicide violence and higher admissions to hospitals for people who have a mental illness studies have shown. Extreme temperatures can also increase stress levels. Worsening air quality limits the time people can exercise or socialize outside; both activities are big stress relievers studies have shown. 8. More of us will die.Higher temperatures will also kill more people the report says. The Midwest alone which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperatures will see an additional 2000 premature deaths per year by 2090. People who live in Rhode Island could see an additional 1500 heat-related ER visits by 2095 and some of those visits will end in death according to the report. Poor air quality can also lead to more strokes and heart attacks.The heat will be a problem for elderly people with chronic conditions increasing the death rate by 2.8% to 4% with each increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in summer temperature.9. We won't be able to work as much.The Southeast alone will probably lose 570 million labor hours by 2090.In the worst-case scenario for farm workers by the end of the century high temperatures will add up to a loss of 2 billion labor hours equating to an estimated $160 billion in 2015 dollars. In Chicago it will be a lot harder to work outside when 100-degree days rare now become increasingly common. By late century the report predicts that the city could see almost 60 days a year over 100 making it more like present-day Phoenix or Las Vegas.10. We won't be able to get around as easily.Infrastructure is vulnerable to increasing temperatures and wet seasons. By 2050 the Southeast will have the most vulnerable bridges at risk of failure and more dams will probably break with increased hurricanes and rain.The East Coast now has 7508 miles of roadways threatened by high tide coastal flooding and that problem will only get worse with climate change. Train systems like Atlanta's MARTA could fail in extreme rains. MARTA authorities are trying to identify what parts of the system are most vulnerable to climate change and are trying to make improvements before problems start.11. Water infrastructure will be challenged.Storm water systems weren't built to withstand the extreme rain that comes with climate change. The cost of adapting urban storm water systems in the Midwest for example could exceed $480 million per year.The total cost to remediate sanitation facility deficiencies to provide safe water and sewers for American Indians in the Northern Great Plains could be around $280 million. These populations are already vulnerable to climate change. For example Standing Rock ran out of water during a 2003 drought. 12. Floods will be more frequent.Charleston is trying to shore things up because it is predicted to have 180 tidal floods per year by 2045 compared with 11 it had in 2014. Each flood event costs the city $12.4 million (in 2009 dollars) studies show.Other Southeast coastal cities like Wilmington North Carolina and Miami and Key West Florida have set records for coastal flooding in recent years. High tide flooding poses daily risks to homes businesses and infrastructure.Sea level rise and storm surge in the Southeast could cost the region up to $60 billion each year by 2050 and up to $99 billion by 2090 under the worst-case scenario.More than half a million people in Florida face "extreme" or "high" risk from sea level rise.13. Wildfires will increase.Wildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than ever -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the US. Burned areas in Southwest California could double by 2050.Firefighting costs in the Southwest alone could total $13 billion from 2006 to 2099.14. History will be lost.Sea level rise will ultimately wipe out the record of human habitation of the coastal margin in the Southeast within the next one or two centuries a study has shown. The Southeast would lose 13000 recorded historic and prehistoric archeological sites due to projected sea level rise.More than 1000 sites on the National Registry of Historic Places are endangered including forts in Charleston South Carolina; St. Augustine Florida; and Savannah Georgia.15. There will be more snakes and other invaders.The predicted freeze-free season will probably lengthen by more than a month in the Southeast. That means a variety of tree-damaging beetles will probably move north and kill trees there. In the West bark beetle infestations could spread; they killed 7% of western US forest area from 1979 to 2012 due to warming temperatures the report says.In South Florida the Burmese python will like the warmer temperatures and reproduce more potentially decimating mammal populations. Rodents that carry disease could also reproduce faster.Invading Humboldt squid that love deoxygenated water warmed and acidified by climate change will prey on fish stocks in the West.,Health
 (CNN)The most dangerous place for women is the home according to a new UN study. Out of an estimated 87000 women killed last year some 50000 -- or 58% -- were killed by partners or family members according to the 2018  report on gender-related killing of women and girls by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). More than a third of the women intentionally killed in 2017 were killed by a current or former partner and 137 women are killed by family members every day it said. While the majority of intentional homicide victims are male and killed by strangers women are far more likely to die at the hands of someone they know the study showed.UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said women "continue to pay the highest price as a result of gender inequality discrimination and negative stereotypes" and that gender-based homicide is a "lethal act on a continuum of gender-based discrimination and abuse." The study released on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25 looked at homicide data related to gender violence and "femicide" a term understood as a gender-based hate crime perpetrated by men. Explore more: When will women live #AsEquals with men? Globally Asia was the region with the highest number of women killed by partners or family members last year at 20000 followed by Africa (19000) the Americas (8000) Europe (3000) and Oceania (300). However rates were higher in Africa and the Americas meaning women faced the greatest risk of being killed by partners or family members in these regions.In Africa these homicides accounted for 3.1 victims per 100000 of the female population and in the Americas the rate was 1.6 victims per 100000 of the female population -- compared with 0.9 per 100000 in Asia.Europe showed the lowest rate of gender-based homicide with 0.7 victims per 100000 of the female population.While countries have taken various steps to address violence against women and gender-related killings -- including the adoption of special units and more training in the criminal justice system -- the report said there is no sign of a fall in the number of gender-related killings of women and girls worldwide. The total number of female homicide victims appears to have increased since 2012 it said when the number of women killed by partners or family members was estimated at 48000 -- or 47% of all female homicide victims.The new study has called for a series of measures to combat the global problem including coordination between police the criminal justice system health and social services and involving men more in addressing the problem. "In order to prevent and tackle gender-related killing of women and girls men need to be involved in efforts to combat intimate partner violence/family-related homicide and in changing cultural norms that move away from violent masculinity and gender stereotypes" it said. ,Health
 (CNN)Sonna Anderson was enjoying a horseback ride through the Badlands in North Dakota in September 2017 when her horse Cody got spooked jerked toward a fence and tripped on a cow track in the dirt. The horse rolled onto Anderson who hit her head briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs. The 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance a helicopter with a medical crew also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away. "But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance" Anderson said. "But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted."For that one helicopter ride to a hospital farther away in Bismarck records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54727.26. Sanford Health Plan her insurance paid $13697.73. That left Anderson with a $41029.53 bill.Valley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment."It shocked me" Anderson said. "I kept thinking 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me when really it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous." Shared outrage Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson and complaints about air ambulance bills have "increased rapidly" according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance. Charges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34000 to more than $533000. A 2017 federal investigation found that costs for an average air ambulance flight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015 a state investigation found. Each state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases CNN could see details about the patient's condition how far and where they were flown how much they were charged how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.  One complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547725. It cost another family $62749.35 to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist. But these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven Florida to one in Orlando for tests which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31253.33 bill.Emergency personnel requested another hospital-to-hospital transfer in Arkansas for an X-ray. It cost $37850 according to a letter to the state insurance department. "We carry insurance to avoid the catastrophic situations" wrote the man whose name was redacted. "I don't see where the consumer is getting a fair shake in this deal." The desire may be there for change but nothing's worked.Patients have tried. Dogged by bill collectors hundreds have turned to the courts. Few consumers have found help research shows. Insurance commissioners' offices and insurance associations have tried to help: sending letters pleading with Congress to do something about "unreasonably high and unregulated rates" as one Mississippi insurance commissioner put it. Yet standalone legislation even with bipartisan backing has gone nowhere. The price of these flights is not regulated by Obamacare. Instead they fall under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act which removed a state's ability to control airfares and routes long before air ambulances were common. October's Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act created a committee to address the problem but it failed to design a definitive solution experts say. States have also tried. North Dakota West Virginia and Texas passed legislation to limit costs but were stymied by the courts. Consistently judges conclude that air ambulance regulation is a federal not state matter due to the Airline Deregulation Act. Air ambulances take off Air ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives but some question whether their value remains.In 1966 civilian deaths from accidental injuries were "a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars" the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time. Air ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then but when researchers discovered that soldiers wounded in the Vietnam War had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.A Denver hospital put the first one into service in 1972. By 1980 there were 32 in the US. In the '90s there were 231. By 2018 there were more than 1461 air ambulances in service. Today air ambulances provide access to care for about 550000 patients a year according to the Association of Air Medical Services The golden hourAir ambulances remain lifesavers especially for patients who need critical care fast. Heart attacks strokes and burns all benefit from quick care. Trauma patients face much better survival odds if treated in the "golden hour" or as quickly as possible after injury studies show. Growing gaps in available care make getting quick medical attention difficult. About 46.7 million Americans don't have access to a Level I or II trauma center within an hour's drive from their home a 2005 JAMA study showed. Since 2005 more than 120 rural hospitals have gone out of business and more emergency departments have closed in the community hospitals that remain. Both of these trends are predicted to increase. That means more patients will need air ambulances.A 'cash cow' Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately new companies entered the market. Private equity firms not hospitals now own the three largest air ambulance providers in the United States.  Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion in 2010 and sold it five years later for $2 billion. As private companies got into the market prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014 the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30000 a ride according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office investigation."They have a cash cow on their hands" New Mexico state Rep. Liz Thomson said. Thomson said a state analysis also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network insurance will cover little or nothing at all. The Association of Air Medical Services says more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not Thomson said and that can be a serious issue."If they aren't in a network they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay" said Susan Rider an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis. "They don't have to participate so they don't and then essentially they can charge what they want."In 2017 Thomson introduced a bill to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for "balance bills" meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature but she hopes to introduce it again.The air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill but it was not alone. "I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection so I had a running joke that while I don't drink I would drink a bottle of champagne if the [insurance?] industry ever stood up for any of my bills" Thomson said. "Sure enough I needed to buy a bottle because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill all these insurance people stood up and said 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous."Mike Castleberry senior vice president of network services and business development for HealthSCOPE Benefits a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans said the costs for these services don't add up. "When you really get into the math it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses" he said. "We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for a pilot" Castleberry said. "Add up all those factors even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that that's still not even half what they are charging me which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills I know it shouldn't cost this much."He also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees who are told to take these flights aren't trauma cases. "They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care" Castleberry said. "Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other."As hospitals specialize in certain types of care there has been an increasing number of hospital-to-hospital air transfers. There are few evidence-based guidelines about what appropriate use for air ambulances. Castleberry who has clients across the country said private operators aren't the only ones making money. "County governments and city hospitals [which  can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs" he said. The actual costsThe air medical transport industry argues that although single flights "may appear to be expensive" they are "very cost-effective" compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.Staffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year said Chris Eastlee vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.Some in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002 based on an estimated 1998 cost pool increasing reimbursement for inflation only. "It was never based on real cost collection" said Rick Sherlock the association's ex-officio president and CEO.About 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay like patients with Medicare. This payment is significantly less than the cost of the transportation Sherlock said."Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service" Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed he said.If the government reimburses the industry more Sherlock said "you eliminate the need to balance bill."The insured pay the costsAnderson who was billed $54727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all. "This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others" the letter reads. "In other words I may not have had $54000 worth of treatment but essentially they have to make up their costs somehow" Anderson said.  "It's not fair at all."North Dakota Insurance Commissioner John Godfread says that on average flights in his state cost consumers $59287."Some of these bills are pretty egregious and these are consumers who have done everything right" Godfread said. "They have health insurance they ask questions ahead of time and often they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly but consumers are the ones left paying the bills and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves." Andrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital. "First I could have driven to that other hospital faster" Courier said. "We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise but we still faced this huge bill." His insurance company picked up $8960.49 of the bill that meant he would be left paying $32103.29 out-of-pocket. "We work hard we pay our bills on time and this is how we are repaid" Courier said. "It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college not for a short helicopter ride."Courier made multiple phone calls to the company a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents balance billing which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually the cost of the flight was forgiven."I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me" Courier said but he's still upset. Med Trans Air Medical Transport which ran the air ambulance that day referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.States try to helpOther state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices encourage patients to call with complaints. Though states like Mississippi have balance billing protection that tactic has had limited success elsewhere as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal not state jurisdiction. North Dakota tried another approach. Its 2015 law required providers to disclose prices before the flight upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety in which case they would be exempt. The courts overturned that legislation ruling that it was a federal matter. North Dakota's 2017 legislation requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. "We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate" Godfread said. "It will however likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court."The Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can "help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle" Eastlee said. "Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together."Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March its new law will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an "emergency medical condition" that they have a choice between air and ground transportation. The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a "good faith estimate."Congress and the lawIt will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act passed in October created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position."It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry" said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill.  "By creating an aviation consumer advocate much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations."The industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it "enhanced consumer protection" and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability Eastlee said "but we also have to work to sustain the service." Sherlock added "the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's balance bill."For Anderson Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41029.53 out of pocket she offered to settle for $4100 on top of the $13000 her insurance paid."I thought I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable" Anderson said. For three months she heard nothing from the company so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month the company offered to negotiate documents show but eventually it accepted her offer.Anderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody her horse is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her. "For a little more than 45 minutes of service they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair" Anderson said. "I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable. No one should feel shocked or panicked by a bill like this. No one ever."Correction:  A previous version of this story misstated the name of Bain Capital.,Health
 (CNN)For 10 years some residents in Denmark South Carolina have been suspicious of the rust-colored water coming from their taps. They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.But through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.The state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance known as HaloSan was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.The city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city. The EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope. It's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3000 people who live in this rural tight-knit community but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from. The chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.One thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use and it should not have. It was used for 10 years. CNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.A spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was "advertised.""The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... " said Tommy Crosby director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.Berry Systems the makers of HaloSan has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment. "It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used" said Gerald Wright mayor of Denmark South Carolina.  "We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test monitor and advise."An EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water."HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and therefore EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water" according to the EPA. An EPA risk assessment from 2007 Disinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program. The EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law "a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product "can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment." The EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered. Wright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC. "The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how or if the standard for daily monitoring was met. Marc Edwards a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark said he was "dumbfounded" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells."I did a thorough search and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before" he said. "And the EPA approvals that I saw none of them were for municipal potable water."In addition Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated."You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose" he said. "There's a maximum allowed amount even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that that level is not being exceeded." Wilma Subra a chemist and environmental health scientist told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring "performed by the certified system operator" of "any chemical" added to the drinking water ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.Joe Charbonnet science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute said without knowing the concentration levels in the water it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.Like many small towns Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at even if the discolored water isn't violating the law. A $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough according to Wright Denmark's mayor. "[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first" he told CNN. "At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do." Water is a problem in thousands of towns across the United States. But in Denmark it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.Denmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years although a link has not been made directly to the water.Brown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink."How can they say it's good to drink?" Smith told CNN. "I'm not gonna drink it and I know other people drink it but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice." The couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook drink and brush their teeth.In 2016 Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television talking about the lead crisis in Flint Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal state and local governments on water quality and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water. Brown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark too.Edwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled.  But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.However medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body. South Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010 and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later it found levels had dropped below the legal limit. But in 2011 Eugene Smith was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high and he should avoid his own water.  "They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN. "I was shocked" Smith said. "Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time."Documents from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water he suspects it.But Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing especially after finding red flags like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright Denmark's mayor later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.Skeptical of the town's transparency Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.Wright wavered and eventually Edwards says he was denied access to the wells. Wright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing."I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples" he told CNN. "I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me."Instead the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells. After Edwards began asking questions the state was ordered by Clemson University which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use. "I mean it has stopped but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?" Eugene Smith said. "I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god."Denmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe."I live here" he said. "I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water." A group of about 40 residents including Smith and Brown are now considering litigation claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston South Carolina attorney John Harrell to represent them.   Harrell tells CNN one of his clients a 12-year-old had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4000 stones in it and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed. "There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination" he said. South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control when asked about the potential litigation said it would be "inappropriate" to comment.CNN's Matt Gannon contributed to this report Correction: ,Health
 (CNN)When Meghann Adams learned that she was pregnant in early 2015 she was ecstatic. Starting a family with her husband Chris had not been easy but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.The entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom Jamie McNeil made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them. "It was the best feeling ever" Adams 35 told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.Twenty weeks into her pregnancy Adams had an anatomy scan a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in the tone changed.Although Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys. The Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney which is believed to affect one in 3500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and as a result can't function. In most cases children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases a kidney transplant might be necessary.McNeil the twins' grandmother wanted to be a donor but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney."It was just really overwhelming and devastating" Adams said. "We were on pins and needles for a while just really unsure."The long wait for a healthy kidneyDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. "I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born" Adam said. Those initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding. Delly was prodded and poked her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up.  At just 6 days old she began to experience renal failure."I just didn't know how to react or what to do" Adams said "and my mind was going in a million different directions."Doctors began talking about dialysis and transplants but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery. Slowly Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month and every day her blood was tested. At 3 months Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.Her nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately but maybe not so far into Delly's future.'A gift certificate for an organ'For those in need of a kidney transplant the wait is long. Of the nearly 100000 people waiting for a kidney last year only about 20% were able to find a match according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years. Delly's next big test will be puberty when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney Adams and her mother McNeil began researching options to prepare.McNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney. And that's how they came across an innovative new program the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.  Essentially it's "a gift certificate for an organ" Adams said. Donors 'waiting for their recipient' The program began at the University of California Los Angeles four years ago when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future. Like Delly Broadman's grandson Quinn then 4 was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.Veale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors. Veale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients. Transplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.  Veale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney. "The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible" Veale said. "These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one who doesn't quite need a kidney yet."Adding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor."It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible" Turgeon said.The vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for and it expires when the voucher holder dies. The first three "voucher donations" triggered 25 transplants. For Delly and her grandmother the voucher program was the answer. 'A dream come true'McNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor. She's never been called to donate though and always wondered about other ways to help."My soul needs a connection with humanity" she said.There were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare long-term impacts can include pain nerve damage hernia or intestinal obstruction.None of that dissuaded McNeil. "I'm a nurse so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it that I just know it's the right thing to do" she said before the surgery. "My soul is at peace with whatever might happen."In September McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day with organs criss-crossing the country."It's like a dream come true to me" McNeil said. For McNeil her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her. "I wish to see more love and so I'm going to be that love" she told Gupta. "If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me."McNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life. "When I'm on my deathbed" she said "the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day."'We're more similar than different' McNeil returned home just a day after her surgery and though she was sore she was in the best of spirits.  Her kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.The news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient. "These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different often matching patients of different ethnicities religions genders sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future" Veale said. "We need a little more kindness in the world and this is what these voucher donations do." Delly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person like her. And to Delly that doesn't mean much. At 2½ she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen read books and giggle with her grandma.,Health
 (CNN)The woman had used oxycodone for almost a decade but told her doctors she had been sober for two years. She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy she said and had completed rehab.But her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs but why?Amid an opioid epidemic the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead they said the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.'A false sense of safety'According to a case report published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.The plant which is native to Southeast Asia is typically used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs it is hailed by some as a solution to the opioid epidemic but derided by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug. The mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep."I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative" said Dr. Whitney Eldridge a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report. The mother might have been well-intentioned but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications the boy was discharged to his parents.It's rare but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that "this case is not unique." He said the FDA "is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery." Gottlieb whose agency has issued a variety of warnings on kratom called the new report "a tragic case of harm" and said it "further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom including the potential for abuse and addiction."And though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom she believes that physicians today "need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn."Experts urge caution cast doubt Some experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms."I'm not surprised that this is possible" said Dr. Andrew Kruegel an associate research scientist at Columbia University "because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users especially at higher doses."But Kruegel who has studied the plant for seven years noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. "The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking" he said. "Without that information you can't really extrapolate too much."And the mother might not have been taking kratom at all said Dr. Edward W. Boyer an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital."It's the husband who reported the kratom use" he said. "The wife who actually ingested the product who thought it was kratom and the authors of the case report itself none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom."Kratom's rocky past and uncertain futureDespite the FDA's warnings kratom is easy to buy and is sometimes sold as a tea in cafés. The nonprofit American Kratom Association estimates that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products."We believe that as in many supplements there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this" Dave Herman the association's chairman said. "That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure."Kratom acts on opioid receptors which the FDA says is evidence of its potential for abuse. The agency points to 44 deaths associated with kratom but Kruegel said that "if you look at those 44 deaths the vast majority of them involve other substances including other strong opioids."Boyer said kratom may have other risks such as seizures but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because "there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone." Respiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction steering users away from more dangerous drugs."If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy" Boyer said.Challenges to developing kratom-based drugsThe American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug especially because they can't patent the raw plant."If I'm a drug company I think that it costs somewhere depending on who you speak to between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market" Herman said. "Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat ride down a river and grab it off a tree?"Because kratom is considered a dietary supplement manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms. But some companies have done just that drawing the FDA's ire for saying their products could "relieve opioid withdrawal" or "treat a myriad of ailments." The association says those cases are anomalies."The reality is our belief is this is America" Herman said. "And if a product is useful for your health and well-being you should have the right to take it as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm."The FDA however continues to warn against kratom even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic."Kratom has never been studied in humans" Gottlieb said in the statement. "What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead as the FDA has warned kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis.",Health
 (CNN)When Simon Kindleysides crossed the finish line at the Virgin Money London Marathon this year what followed was a blur -- but he became a "superhero" to his kids and he set a world record in becoming the first paralyzed man to complete the race on foot.He was the final finisher.When David Fraser crossed the finish line at the TCS New York City Marathon last year it marked his 10th time completing that race using his toes to push his wheelchair to the finish line.He was the final finisher.When Amina Abdul-Jalil crossed the finish line this year at an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race she never felt more proud. She accomplished something she didn't think she could with asthma but because of her history of depression running has been a "lifesaver."She was the final finisher.Lisa Jackson has run 110 marathons and ultramarathons around the world. After each she has a tradition of sleeping with the new medal around her neck to celebrate her accomplishment.In 25 of those races she was the final finisher -- and she revels in coming in last.The world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance Olympic medalist Shalane Flanagan broke the finish line tape at the New York City Marathon last year becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.Yet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia director of the New York City Marathon puts it "for every runner there's a story.""They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train" he said. "Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring from the first to the final finish." On average it takes bout 4½ hours for men and women to complete a marathon Ciaccia said but that time can vary drastically among racers.In honor of Sunday's New York City Marathon where more than 50000 people traveled through the five boroughs here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.One thing they have in common: They never gave up.'Even when I was able-bodied I took plenty for granted'As Simon Kindleysides 34 took his first steps in the London Marathon in April it felt as if magic was in the air. "As we were walking toward the first mile we actually started blending in with all the runners" he said. "Everyone was on the streets cheering and that was a magical moment."As time went on the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking. Kindleysides who is paralyzed from the waist down and typically uses a wheelchair was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving."I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery" he said.In 2013 Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.Before his paralysis the London-based singer and dancer had "always wanted to run a marathon" he said but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year."Even when I was able-bodied I took plenty for granted" Kindleysides said. "You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on."During the London Marathon the last two miles were the hardest."At that point I was exhausted. It was freezing cold and I was hurting and emotional" Kindleysides said but he kept going."I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us and I was raising money for The Brain Tumour Charity" he said. "I didn't want to let them down myself down and I thought if I'd get this far I'd have to continue."So he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.Once Kindleysides crossed the finish line a live news crew interviewed him and "I said 'I need a full body massage and a Jägerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking" he said. "My brain went mashed potato."Then recovering at home he shared his accomplishment with his three children."I was called RoboCop Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine" Simon said."They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair and now they say I'm their dad the only one who has walked a marathon" he said. "It was amazing emotional just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't."Kindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year including the London Marathon again.Meanwhile a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.'Every year I run the race for my wife'David Fraser who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment. Fraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does."My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year and they couldn't believe I was the last one because I had done many races. I had done 5K I had done half-marathons I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that" said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called Nightwarriors Fitness."But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it" he said of his family. "At the start of every marathon I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race."Cerebral palsy a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.Before 2007 he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding but that year his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race. He has set out to finish it every year since."That next year 2008 my wife developed stomach cancer and now every year I run the race for my wife" said Fraser whose wife still attends his races.He even developed a strategy: "Ninety percent of the race I do backwards" he said. "Because when I go downhill I go forward but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain I go backwards. ... I always run that way."Overall Fraser said "The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done really done you now have to talk yourself back into it."Fraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday and he's looking forward to the race."All runners are out of their minds" he joked. "Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it."As for one runner in Atlanta not only does she love it it has been a "lifesaver."'There's nothing I would change'Amina Abdul-Jalil started running last year around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer."I realized in that time I don't think it was even the whole month that I had gained 10 pounds and I was just stressed and I thought 'I need to do something now or this isn't going to end well' " Abdul-Jalil said.So she joined a running group called Black Girls Run. "To be completely honest it's been a lifesaver in a very real way because I have major depressive disorder" she said.Regular exercise such as running can help curb symptoms of depression something that Abdul-Jalil said she noticed firsthand.As she continued running with the group an opportunity arose to join in an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race but Abdul-Jalil was hesitant. Then she saw a video clip of ultramarathon runner Mirna Valerio a runner with a body type similar to her own."I was like 'she runs like me' -- and that was a big moment for me" Abdul-Jalil said. "So I was like 'maybe maybe maybe I could pull this off.' "Then she registered for The Race and trained for 12 weeks.Abdul-Jalil and I both ran that half-marathon last month. Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it."Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma" said the 41-year-old mother who lives in the Atlanta area."And I'm not FloJo-built" she added referencing late track-and-field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.Over the 13.1-mile course Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' "Ride" and Outkast's "B.O.B."Around mile three a medical director approached her indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it the medical director said.In that moment Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged."I wanted to cry and quit and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head" she said. To keep her going she thought about the running group Black Girls Run."I literally went back to conversations that I've had" she said. "Every time I said I can't do something there was at least one or two other people that said I could."So she kept going."By the last two miles it was just me" Abdul-Jalil said.Then during the last mile a race administrator and volunteer met her on the course and ran with her to the finish. They even posted a live video of her finish on Facebook to celebrate her as the last runner.A couple of days later Abdul-Jalil watched the video which has gotten more than 2000 views.With her depression Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish "that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart" she said. "There's nothing I would change."Before the race "I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh my God what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again" she said. "You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated. It's validating."Being the final finisher is something that one runner in London not only would do again but has done 25 times.'It's not about the time you do but the time you have'Lisa Jackson loves being the last runner."I think it's a special place in the race" said the London-based author of the book "Your Pace or Mine? What Running Taught Me About Life Laughter and Coming Last.""When you're last it's a sense of occasion. People really admire you for your grit when getting there" she said.Jackson 51 was "incredibly unathletic" as a child and ran her first marathon when she was 31."After the indescribable feeling of accomplishment and joy I thought 'I have to experience this feeling every year at least once' " she said and so she set out to run at least one marathon annually."When I first started running my biggest fear was coming last" Jackson said. "And it was actually my 31st marathon -- the South Downs Marathon -- when I was the final finisher for the first time."Jackson ran the South Downs trail marathon in the UK in June 2012. The course was hilly the summer heat was grueling and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.Jackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course she said. They spoke as she continued on her way and she made a friend.Next thing she knew she was approaching the finish line where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation."I no longer have any fear of coming last and if there's a risk of coming second to last I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line" Jackson said.After all in that moment on the South Downs she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile."My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have" said Jackson who went on to run the New York Boston London Chicago and Rome marathons among dozens of others."I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ... I think 'well how many races have you run?' " she joked."When you do something that is not easy and you think you're not cut out for and you succeed at it it gives you so much courage in other aspects of your life" she said. "Running is really the most life-affirming energizing thing you can do. Don't let the fear of coming last put you off. Every race needs a winner and a loser and it might as well be you.",Health
 (CNN)Two physicians who lost their young son to the flu last year want parents to listen to their message born of great grief and suffering: Get your child a flu shot. Drs. Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son Leon did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick. "I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy" said Laura a psychiatrist. "This has been a hard haul for us and we're very private people but we're trying to help other families."Leon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a historic high. Approximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot according to the CDC. Laura and Anthony a rheumatologist had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas where state law prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.The couple busy with their newborn third child Cameron decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit scheduled for January 3. Leon died 10 days before that appointment. "It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really really needed to prioritize" Laura said.  "It just slipped through the cracks." The Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Muñoz. For 20 years Muñoz a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children. The rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year according to the CDC which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot. The problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work children don't have as many options. In most states there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule. Only 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age according to the National Association of State Pharmacy Associations. "It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn" Muñoz said. There's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy said Muñoz who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.Some states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year after the historic flu season the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older. "Good for you New York!" Muñoz said. "More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push." Dr. William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics. Right now he said it's difficult for those departments to purchase large quantities of vaccine and to bill insurance. "We need to do more to make it easy" he said. The Sidaris are doing their part. Last month they sponsored a "Say Boo to the Flu" event in their hometown Albion New York where 59 children were vaccinated. Although the CDC encourages flu vaccines by the end of October each year it's especially important to get the shot well before the holidays Muñoz said. Flu activity can peak in December and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it. "Leon is my reason this season and every season for getting flu shots on time" Laura Sidari wrote on her Facebook page. "Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait but the flu shot cannot." CNN's John Bonifield and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this story. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated where the Sidaris lived last year. ,Health
 (CNN)John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too and she knew something had gone terribly wrong."I told myself that this can't be happening" Joanne said. "I'm putting two and two together and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts and I'm frantic my mind is running."John now 19 had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew. When the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked "John can you take off your shirt?" What she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before requiring additional surgeries to repair but this was different. "They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back" she remembers.Within a few weeks John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all and the recovery was grueling. "Every 15 minutes" Joanne said "the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?'" "I can't do this anymore" John told his mom ripping off his pulse oximeter. "I want to go home."A lifetime of struggleWhen he was 6 years old John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day taking it off only to shower. His mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school John felt different. "I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on" he said. "It was just so annoying."Scoliosis the curving of the spine from side to side affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.But for all its inconvenience the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery doctors said and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.But after 17 operations those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever. "It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot" said Dr. Jeffrey Wang president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. "But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails."John's surgeon unable to treat him any further recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society. "Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of" said Lenke. "Some surgeons at some point are not comfortable treating these conditions."  'How do I trust you?'John's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to NewYork-Presbyterian a month later Lenke said that John was "bending by the hour." Joanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations."She was a little terrified of any more surgeries" Lenke said "because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'Indeed Joanne remembers "I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option and the surgery had to be done."John's kyphosis an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back was so severe that it impacted his breathing leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. "Walking through school even from one end to the other I'd be out of breath" John remembered. "It was definitely a struggle."He needed surgery but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life. Called a vertebral column resection Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together."It does work well" Lenke said "but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord and that's risky." His mother was terrified but John had few options."The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die" Lenke said "and she could see that slowly happening."A moment of terror before 'a new chance at life'The surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan."We test electrical activity" Lenke said "and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out the spinal cord activity went away." That isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but "for an hour he was technically paralyzed." Lenke powered through the surgery working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord and John emerged from the operation with no complications. "The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom" said Joanne. "They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working and they saved my son's life."The top of John's spine had been bent forward over 120 degrees before his surgery making it difficult to stand straight up and perform daily tasks like walking up stairs."I was collapsing on myself" John said. His operation was so drastic that it changed his body's center of gravity."Those first steps leaning up against the bed I felt like I was in a new body" John said. "It's a pretty crazy feeling and I still remember it today. It was almost like learning how to walk again."It was his 18th surgery but things felt different this time. "This might be a chance at a new life" he remembers thinking. "I could feel myself getting stronger with each step."From the operating room to the golf courseA year later John graduated high school and attended his senior prom. "I was just praying everyday for a miracle to happen that I would be able to see my son graduate" said Joanne. When it finally happened earlier this year "it was a beautiful day" she said.John is now seven inches taller and regularly plays basketball and golf activities that were unthinkable before his surgery. He's learning how to drive too and is currently a student at Nassau Community College on Long Island.He isn't sure exactly what he wants to do when he graduates but John dreams of being a doctor."Since I was helped as a child I want to help children as they're growing up and dealing with their own situations" he said. And while he isn't picking up the scalpel just yet John has some advice for those who might be struggling like he did."If you just stay positive" he said "and work through and deal with the pain of the situation if you can just get through that then there are going to be brighter days."Davide Cannaviccio contributed to this story.,Health
Homosassa Florida (CNN)Kelly Thomas inches across the soft grass using a walker to navigate her way. Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles. "It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little I mean a lot" she says.Thomas 24 is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday. On a recent sunny day Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.She has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work.Visiting this time she walks toward the tree talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. "One foot in front of the other" she says. "Slowly but surely."At 5 feet 1 inch tall she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately not just from when she walks but also when she talks.  "Paralysis isn't in my dictionary." "Don't call me handicapped because I'm not.""Thank God I was raised cowboy tough."It takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories. "I tell you what" she says. "It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended."She woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19 she was paralyzed from the chest down.She told her neurosurgeon she would walk again no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to "go chasing something that's never going to happen."The journey has been in no way easy. There were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation she would say to God "I don't know why this has happened but if you can help me to understand this it might make it a little easier." She had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up. The trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met. As she stands next to the tree Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. "It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible" she says. "Somewhere between possible and impossible."Being here gives me a sense of power because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have."Transforming the spinal cord injury fieldThomas is part of innovative research conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville. In a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine two of four patients with "motor complete spinal cord injury" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers. "This should change our thinking about people with paralysis" said Susan Harkema one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. "It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries."Claudia Angeli the other lead researcher and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs. "It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy" Angeli said.Over the years their research has involved 14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. All 14 patients have experienced voluntarily movement with the implant the researchers said. They  also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.The latest study focused on four patients including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months.  A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 months after receiving the implant. All four were able to stand independently and two were able to walk over ground the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip setting his therapy back by several months the researchers said.The other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. "With the stimulator off" Angeli said "he can't even sit up."Harkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment. Harkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations according to a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016. The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work. What's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again? "I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program" Harkema said. "They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers."Adding to the excitement of these advancements another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California Los Angeles."What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis" Dr. Kendall Lee the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories said in a press release.There have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked. One study in 2015 and another in 2016 showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called "brain-computer interface" in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity allowing some patients to walk."They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system but the overall outcome is similar" said Monica Perez a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami. Monday's studies Perez said provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that "can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing." "What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited even though you have an injury from years ago" said Perez who was not connected to either study. From a scientific point of view she said an important consequence of the studies is the awareness "that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections" she said. "These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.""It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist" she said. "But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated."Harkema and Angeli whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program. For Thomas it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through. "Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life because I took something that was thought to be impossible and I turned it into possible" she says.'Way too many things to do'Since she was a child Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos she and Shadow were inseparable. "All you need is love and a horse" the motto next to her bed says.In her late teens she would run 3 to 4 miles a day train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist. All of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.Not only had she lost her ability to walk she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence she felt had been stripped. "I was lying there saying 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life' " she says. "I have way too many things to do."To walk again she'd have to "cowboy up" as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch. It would push her to the limits at times leaving her on the floor crying wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy working on standing and stepping for an hour every day. The stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant but at the time no one had walked. She thought "what's the point of going through so much work?""Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes" she says "was not enough for me."One of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder "what if" for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.  On August 5 2017 the family's vehicle was loaded up. "Are we going?" her father asked. They drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month. Sensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on."There was this rushing vibration" she says. "It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild."The real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success she says but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week a couple of hours every day.She clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions repeating phrases to herself: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" and "God is with me. I will not fail.""I tell you what: After the implant I was introduced to a whole new ballgame" she says. "The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions just to get me through because I wanted to quit."The stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves allowing her to consciously control the movement. It began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.She was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase "No Days Off" on that magical day in February. She took a step or two and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. "Oh my God" Thomas said. She wiped away the tears and took more steps. It was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs body and mind.  "Trying to trust my body trying to find a cadence was very hard."Finding her callingThomas can now walk and talk at the same time but she still must focus on each step.She presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. "I'm still paralyzed as can be without it" she says. When she stands she asks herself "How do I walk again?"Beyond helping her walk the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. "I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it" she says.Strolling across her front lawn at the family ranch she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again. She points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again. "That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed" she says. For now she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard. In town that encouragement is on full display."I just want to tell you congratulations sweetie. You're doing beautiful" a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.A man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. "Need some help?" he asks."No sir" she responds. "I've got it."She exemplifies a fierce determination like few others. Through her struggle she's found her calling.  Being around her one can't help but be inspired. She rattles off an array of powerful messages. "Even if I can't physically help people like I initially intended to do I can dang sure encourage help and motivate.""I carry on with my life like nobody's business even if my legs aren't working so great.""The stimulator is facilitating my movement but my strength is coming from within."That strength is what's gotten her this far. Her 19-year-old brother Sam sums it up in cowboy speak: "There's nothing she can't do. That's for sure."He lifts his sister onto Shadow. Kelly and Shadow trot around the front yard.

 (CNN)For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time. In Oklahoma a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction those years were the heyday of the "shake and bake" method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.The technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth but with one tiny misstep the chemical reaction that occurs inside can cause deadly explosions.By 2011 Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city. "People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine" he said. "It was a really horrible time."When new laws were enacted to limit access to pseudoephedrine -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011 his department encountered just 19 last year.But Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before with most of it coming from south of the border.And while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.The role of Mexican 'superlabs'Richard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.He said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.As it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void."They came in with much purer much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country" Salter said.Salter said in 2012 the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1100 an ounce. Today his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450."That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career" he said.The reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas "shake and bake" labs could turn out lots of small batches so-called "superlabs" in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.Salter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.Along the border officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.Anne Maricich deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year."The other hard narcotics like cocaine heroin and fentanyl we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth" she said.On the streets of Oklahoma this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.The number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017 there were 327 meth overdose deaths but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher according to Mark Woodward spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics."There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis" said Woodward. "But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine."Perhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.In just the first six months of 2018 Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds. He can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution. Wollmershauser said his department is trying to use more "front end diversion" tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.While the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year. "I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens but the addiction is strong and it's difficult" Wollmershauser said.How meth fueled a crisis behind barsLindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.At age 14 her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth. "I immediately liked it" McAteer said. "It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment." It was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.After using meth for several years she said she stopped for a brief period but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on her addiction spiraled out of control."I had nothing" McAteer said. "I was losing everything and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK despite the fact that nothing was OK."In addition to using meth McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.Mass incarceration is also an issue in Oklahoma -- particularly among women -- and lengthy sentences for drug offenses are a major contributing factor according to analysis by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. The state has the nation's highest female incarceration rate with 149 out of every 100000 women locked up more than double the national average. But even for those like McAteer who face time in prison there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. Women in Recovery or WIR is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.With the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.Mimi Tarrasch the executive senior director for WIR said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth."Early on because it's a stimulant they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated" said Roxanne Hinther clinical director for WIR. "But ultimately they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have."Tarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.Using a range of treatments training and education the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.McAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.Since Women in Recovery began in 2009 390 women have graduated with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity."I can say that recovery is definitely possible and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment" McAteer said. "It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work but the vast majority of us do.",Health
This story contains graphic language.  (CNN)Her Catholic boyfriend said he was waiting until marriage to have sex so she felt safe. But after she passed out fully clothed on prom night she woke up naked with him on top of and inside her. She got pregnant that night 36 years ago and he paid for her abortion. Then he mailed a letter to tell her she was going to hell.Five drunken frat boys piled on top of a college sophomore who was sober as the party's loud music drowned out her screams in the dark room. They grabbed at and groped her. One of them penetrated her with his finger before she broke free and ran. A 19-year-old studying abroad woke up to a young man fondling her and masturbating in her face. An older boy plied a 15-year-old with booze and after she passed out at a house party stole her virginity. Another young woman took the cocktail a cute guy offered on her 21st birthday. She didn't know what to call it when the same guy had his way with her after she grew woozy they left the bar and her body went numb. More than a decade later when a friend of friends assaulted her dislocated her jaw and left her bruised she knew the word: rape. These are just a sampling of the dozens of stories of sexual assault that were shared with me in recent days by phone email and through social media. They are accounts from women in their 30s 40s and 50s who I asked to reflect on their younger years mostly in high school and college. They spoke out on the condition that they and the accused would remain anonymous.Some called their sexual assaults a "cliché" perhaps too common to be worth mentioning. One woman simply quipped "Is there a woman who made it through college without this experience?"With decades-old allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Brett Kavanaugh making headlines and threatening to derail his Supreme Court nomination we've entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Women are thinking back to their own experiences many of them for the first time in years. They're talking about their assaults online in their homes and at dinner parties. What are these stories stirring up in women? Are they putting themselves in the shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers? And do they think they could or would come forward themselves if the men who assaulted them were suddenly poised for positions of power?  'Every scream I never screamed'Plenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few if they knew who their attackers were reported anything to authorities or other adults including parents. Those who did learned quickly why most girls and women don't. They weren't believed felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the "boys will be boys" line even by their mothers.  Some had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.There were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to "feel like a slut." The last time she was assaulted she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch."At first I froze but then I started to scream" she said. "I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed." They were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know and ones they were fixed up with knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the "golden boy" in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.A fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members."Until their parents die until they move away and I never have to see their face again until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women" she wrote in a social media post.  To come forward about these men before then wouldn't be "worth the headache" she said. But "if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes."'Bookend to Brock Turner'For some this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a "bookend to Brock Turner" a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who in January 2015 was caught on campus outside a fraternity sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three. One woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won. "I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office which meant that it was okay to assault women" she wrote.The growing activism of women give many of them hope even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.  "The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for" one woman said. They want to think though that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.If they could talk to their younger selves they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.Their own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones sons and daughters learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies. Some have told their older kids what happened to them while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant. One woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.'A skeleton' in his closetThey question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.There are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and even after all these years worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it they'd be as brave."The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward" one woman wrote in an email. "We can't all be liars."A few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them. They've monitored their lives and careers. One woman decided timed with the 30th anniversary of her assault to send the now-family man a letter. She never expected to hear from him -- and she didn't. She did it for herself. By putting words to what she's lived with all these years she felt better.At one point the prom date who once vowed he was waiting until marriage to have sex and then paid for an abortion after he raped his date held a job in a state attorney's office. "I remember back then wondering what I would do if I learned he was running for public office. It seemed plausible that he would" the woman said. "I wondered if he considered me and my abortion a skeleton in his Republican closet."Just days after she first typed #MeToo on her Facebook page last year even though they had no friends in common he sent her a Facebook friend request. It was the first contact he'd made with her since he'd written 35 years earlier to tell her she was going to hell. It felt a bit like "a litmus test" she said. Would her accepting in his mind mean he was safe?She waited a few days and then accepted. She did it not because she was letting him off the hook. She accepted because she wanted him to see her every post to know how strong she is. ,Health
 (CNN)"Jingle Bells" played on radios across Ohio. The local mall plastered "Merry Christmas" on its digital signs. And hundreds of people in 90-degree weather wore Santa hats as they caroled in front of one little boy's home. It's only September but for a 2-year-old with terminal brain cancer Christmas came early this year.Colerain Township a suburb of Cincinnati celebrated the holiday this weekend because doctors say the boy Brody Allen wouldn't make it to December. Despite aggressive and painful chemotherapy brain scans showed that Brody's five embryonal tumors were not responding to treatment. "The doctor had tears in his eyes as he was telling us" said his aunt Dina Brock. "The poor boy had gone through so much in the hospital but there wasn't any good news."After Brody spent more than 90 days at Cincinnati Children's Hospital much of it in the intensive care unit the Allen family decided to bring him home. Painful radiation therapy would do little for his prognosis doctors told the family and "we wanted to do everything we could to let him live life" said Brock."He can't use the left side of his body his speech has changed and he has tremors" she said. But back at home "he doesn't get down about it. He doesn't know what we know. He doesn't know he has cancer."'Team Brody' goes viralThe family started a Facebook group "Team Brody" to update loved ones on his status. Hoping to celebrate the holidays one last time with their son the family made a post asking friends and family for Christmas lights.That small request went viral and more than 13000 people have since joined the group sending prayers from as far away as London and Paris. "The love and attention they're giving Brody is unbelievable" said Brock. "People are reaching out for no other reason than their good will."Back at home Brody's neighborhood soon turned into a winter wonderland. Inflatable snowmen lined the streets and garland hung from fences and front doors. Brody was the Grand Marshal of his own superhero-themed Christmas parade which featured Santa riding a firetruck cheerleaders and a dazzling fireworks display this past Sunday."When the parade started my family was in the front row to see it all" said Amanda Hill a Colerain Township resident who watched with her husband and twin children. "It was overwhelming and abundantly clear how much that little boy meant to the community."A town comes togetherIn divisive times Brody's story has brought family friends and even strangers together."This is a community of people with diverse backgrounds beliefs ethnicities and genders coming together for Brody" said Matt Castleman a pastor at the Crossroads West Side church outside of Cincinnati. Castleman who studied musical theater worked with local radio station WARM 98.5 to organize a flash mob on Saturday outside of Brody's home.The Children's Theatre of Cincinnati provided reindeer and elf costumes Castleman's church helped turn out singers and the station took photos. Volunteers handed out lyric sheets at a local grocery store before consolidating cars and heading to Brody's neighborhood where they distributed gifts and sang songs like "Silent Night" while holding hands."The Allen family knew that we were coming but they were shocked when we showed up with hundreds of people" Castleman said. It was so hot he added that "you couldn't tell if people were crying or sweating." The airwaves were blanketed with the holiday spirit too. "We decided to play one Christmas song per hour with a shout out to Brody before every song to help him celebrate with his family a little early" said Brian Demay the program director at WARM 98.5.'He definitely seems happier'That support has meant the world to Brody an outgoing boy who spent months in the ICU where he often wasn't allowed to see his brothers or sisters. "He definitely seems happier to me" said Brock. "He loves people and he's not afraid of anyone." "He's a flirt" she added. "He's a major flirt. He's flirting with any and everybody but mostly the ladies." And he has fans too. Supporters have been using the hashtag #TeamBrody to send support to members of the Allen family who have already raised more than $37000 through a GoFundMe created to cover Brody's medical expenses. The boy's father Todd Allen wrote on Facebook that "the world collectively has reached out to hug our son.""You have taught me that we are not bound together solely by our nationality language religion culture race social or economic status" he said. "We are bound by our humanity.",Health
Augusta Georgia (CNN)There's nothing sweet or adorable about the way newlyweds Brittany and Ryan Coleman first met -- no "meet cute" like in rom-com movies or romance novels.  It was 2015 and Brittany bought heroin from Ryan in a parking lot and Ryan cheated her. Brittany called him some choice names and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Despite that inauspicious beginning and the many years of drug abuse that preceded it the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction. They want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States. "You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out" said Brittany 29. Addiction rehab and relapseWhen Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old her parents divorced and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania. She struggled emotionally and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon pain pills became her drug of choice and by age 18 she was addicted. Ryan now 37 was born into a military family moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany he had a loving family but as a teenager he felt like he didn't fit in and he started to smoke pot at age 14. "I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high" he said. By the time Ryan was 17 he was smoking pot every day and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers. His father an Army drill sergeant and his mother a high school teacher begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for. By 22 he was strung out on heroin. "I had to have it" he said. Over the next 10 years Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city they both used heroin methamphetamines prescription opioids Xanax cocaine and alcohol.Brittany overdosed three times and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole too and had a stint at prostitution. Their parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse. By 2016 both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta Georgia. They happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot. A forbidden love (and with good reason) He's cute Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab. She's beautiful Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar. He realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal. "I thought 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off" Ryan remembered. "I did want to make amends but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her."Dating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why. As they fell in love they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly imperceptibly Ryan slipped away taking Brittany with him. After about four months of dating one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life. But instead he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.He called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send. It said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send. And everything fell apart. Giving up heroin -- and each otherFor the next week Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin right back to cocaine right back to meth sometimes all at the same time. "I even romanticized it saying f*** all the rules we're going to be heroin junkies together all that 'Trainspotting' bull****" he said referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. "Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use." Then on October 3 2016 they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom and Ryan right outside unconscious in his car.The medics gave them doses of Narcan the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses. Ryan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her. "I had almost killed the person I loved the most" he said. Brittany returned to Hope House a treatment center for women in Augusta. Ryan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors he got down on his knees -- and apologized. "He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people" Brittany said crying at the memory of it. "He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me." They then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month they had no contact at all. "The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery and not on each other" Brittany said. "It was the only way it would work." Brittany then left Hope House and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly and then a year and a half later on February 24 2018 they were married.Two years soberNext month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center helping others overcome their addictions. They volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan the drug that saved both of them so many times. When asked how they survived addiction where so many have died they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them. They also say they let other people guide them: their families who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive. All of those people joined them on their wedding day."It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together" Ryan said. Sometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive much less in a loving stable relationship. "It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human" she said. "I didn't ever picture that for myself." They want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics there can be hope. "I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out" Ryan said. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.,Health
 (CNN)Cystic fibrosis did not define Claire Wineland. She did.No matter the obstacles placed in front of her of which there were many she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people invited -- no demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile spunk and spirit.On Sunday evening after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.'Love what is'A quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.Her parents Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland split up when Claire was 3 but they remained friends and partners in her care.Her father credits Claire with teaching him "to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet" and to learn to "love what is."Yeager who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.In 2017 Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point Claire looked at her mom and said "After you die you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything" Yeager remembered.These words were a gift a reminder that Claire would remain with her always even after she was gone.Trusting ClaireMore than 30000 people in the United States more than 70000 worldwide have cystic fibrosis according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The median survival age is 40 the foundation reports which is a great improvement from the 1950s when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.The genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion affects the pancreas and other organs and eventually leads to respiratory failure.There is no cure but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant when successful can add years to a patient's life.Claire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care she knew her body best -- what worked for her what didn't and how far she was willing to go.So when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant they had to accept her decision even if it pained them."I had to be honest" she once explained. "It's not for me and never has been."A change of heartClaire took the gift of life and her health seriously but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited "cures" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.She was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be "another happy sick person book" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.At a TEDx talk she gave last year Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life."Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second" she said. "It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given." Claire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome albeit terrifying development for those who loved her.To get on the list for new lungs she had to be sick enough to need them yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.But Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes. Revealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up "Don't Panic" logo from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."She listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed."None of it spooked me" Claire said afterward. "Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything."'It's a GO!!!'In late May she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list temporarily. By mid-August she was back on and feeling ready.She'd worked hard to get there was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing upon doctor's orders would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.  She knew that the call could come at any minute and on August 26 it did."It's a GO!!!" she posted on Twitter not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. "See y'all on [the] other side."The nine-hour surgery went well and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room. But not long after the successful surgery hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries and what her mother described as "Herculean efforts" to try to save her the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully with her parents by her side. "They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last" Laura McHolm the board chair for Claire's foundation wrote in a Facebook post. Less than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge according to the United Network for Organ Sharing which operates the nation's organ transplant system.Claire who understood the importance of organ donation was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference. "Claire was able to save the life of two people her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. "Claire's gift is huge I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero."The family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease. 'Go enjoy it'In one of the last videos Claire posted she went where she hadn't before.A self-described "goofball" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more."It hurts everything inside of me to make this video" she said into the camera. "I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over."She had plenty of emotional support but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant and she didn't make it or was not able to work again she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it she said she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.Before signing off Claire implored viewers to do one thing."Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously" she said with her signature smile and laugh her eyes not yet dry. "Go enjoy it 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it.",Health
Hong Kong (CNN)Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.It's summer on the island and at 8:30 in the morning the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit with an unforgiving level of humidity. But the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.  The word qigong is a combination of "qi" meaning energy and "gong" which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice explained Lok who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years. It is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow coordinated movements. Movement meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being. Lok explains that "in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty so the first thing to empty is the mind so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing relax all the strength and relax the mind so it's some kind of meditation."Meditation has been shown to improve stress anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity. As a result qigong itself is a health practice Lok said.Feeling the energyFor Lok it is vital that all his students experience "qi" before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong which has a strong connection with nature he explained. In his class he says that you can start to experience the "qi" by simply holding a specific posture. Your feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints. Lok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground. He then asks his students whether they can sense "qi"-- a warm feeling or  feeling of life in their fingertips often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it the movement routine can begin. He warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing "qi" and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice. The goal of the movement is to clear blockages release pain and refresh the body and mind.Slow and steadyThe movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads rotate their wrists lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that "as soon as you get into it the qi begins to flow."Emotions are also calmed and people tend to live happier Lok believes. In a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.Removing the mysteryCecilia Chan chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.  There are a lot of "misconceptions about qigong" said Chan whose team studies internal qigong or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead the participants use their own energy to do the movements similar to other movement practices like yoga. They do not explore external qigong in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures. Chan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome. Her team conducted studies on women with chronic fatigue in 2012 concluding that qigong "may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning."They conducted another study in 2017 to explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. "From our study we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive" Chan said. "They become less indulged in their suffering and they leave the victim's role more readily." She likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it "teaches a philosophy of letting go" helping those who practice it to embrace a "philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself."Researchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong with their research finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Lok however needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. "There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general" he said. "If you have a little time try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong but if you don't try it there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy and the benefit is ever so great.",Health
Nyack New York (CNN)Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph. The crowd claps in unison and a DJ cranks up the music. The banquet hall on the banks of the Hudson pulsates as nine of Cara's best friends lead a procession to the dance floor. It's the start of her Sweet 16 birthday party -- a celebration not just of her big day but of all that has happened in the past year. A way for friends and family to express their love. Cara became a viral sensation months ago after the teen with a seizure disorder delivered a blunt message to her insurer. Her two words for Aetna -- "screw you" -- expressed the anger she felt at being denied a minimally invasive brain surgery that promised to end her seizures. Her story first told by CNN in December triggered a massive uproar and Aetna eventually approved the procedure.This Saturday evening amid the cheers of her closest friends Cara radiates on stage beneath strings of white flashing lights. Then someone shouts and the dance floor clears. Everyone rushes outside. It's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens. Cara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos. "That's what's important in life -- miracles right?" her mother Julie Pressman says pointing to the sky. "I can finally exhale."Her father Rob says it's "like a unicorn coming down.""She's been so happy since the operation" he says. "We're looking forward to a great year."It's a moment the family thought might never come. After Cara speaks Aetna changes policyCara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures. Each time they struck her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field during softball games on stage during plays in the classroom. Most anywhere.Her doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate. It's cutting-edge work performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or in some cases the entire skull cap is removed. Yet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery "experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.""Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition" Aetna said.When first approached for comment by CNN late last year the insurance giant stood by its denial.In response Cara had this message: "Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain I would probably just say 'screw you.' "From there the story took off. The hashtags #ScrewAetna and #CaraPressman were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read "I'm on Cara's team" on the front; on the back the message said #SYA (short for #ScrewYouAetna).Behind the scenes neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwell Health New York's largest health care provider.The hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: "This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own." Solazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.The Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it."I was happy to do that" Mehta said.Cara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery he said he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot. As a result Mehta said her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go."We did our due diligence and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy" he told CNN.Along the way Aetna had a change of heart. In April the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: "Coverage for this service has been approved subject to the requirements in this letter."There was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.Pressed by CNN for answers Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. "Based on recently published clinical evidence the procedure was approved."Aetna went on to say it recently updated its policies for epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation. "Related in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data" Aetna said. "The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met."As shared in December we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies and will continue to do so."Mehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: "She really advocated for herself and it worked out for her. Whatever happened it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her."Northwell's Solazzo added "Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery."'Never been more excited'The day of the surgery July 25 was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister Lindsey crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial everyday stuff as families often do.But make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone. Cara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had "never been more excited for anything in my life." Her first grand mal seizure when she fell to the floor and shook came at the age of 9 but she remembers having smaller aura seizures when she would space out for brief spells as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day sometimes as many as 30."It's been really really difficult to live with" she said. As she was wheeled off to the operating room Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her reassuring her that Cara would be OK. Cara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started. Laser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery known as a temporal lobectomy."This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done" she says.In the operating room the hourlong procedure "went quite well" Mehta said. "Everything went as planned." There are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation Mehta said where laser ablation surgeries are performed with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.A comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: "My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy."The laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents he says because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery Mehta said.Patients can suffer short-term memory loss especially forgetting names of people they meet. "It's not usually something that is devastating especially when you're younger" he says. "Given that she's young we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt."Cara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.Based on her recovery three weeks after surgery he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. "The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures" Mehta says. "We want no seizures."I'm keeping my fingers crossed."A new vibrant CaraAt her birthday party the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.Her sister marvels at her transformation. "She is just flourishing" Lindsey says. "I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself."Cara says it's been "weird" ever since her surgery because "I feel so much better." It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free."It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream but I also know it's real."On stage Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: "One of the funniest people I know."There's the uncle who is "one of the biggest weirdos I know" the friend who "always knows when to cheer me up" and the one who "always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave." She saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner and thanks her for planning the entire party. "She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best" Cara says. "Mom please come up and light the final candle!"As the Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun" echoes across the room Mom rushes to hug her daughter. As the two embrace George Harrison's voice sings:Little darling the smiles returning to the facesLittle darling it seems like years since it's been here.,Health
This is the first part of the series"Escape from the Mayo Clinic." Read the second part here. Sherburn Minnesota (CNN)In a jaw-dropping moment caught on video an 18-year-old high school senior rushes to escape from the hospital that saved her life and then she says held her captive.  At the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.Staff members come running toward him yelling "No! No!" One of them grabs the young woman's arm."Get your hands off my daughter!" her stepfather yells.The car speeds away the stepfather and the patient inside her mother at the wheel.Mayo security calls 911."We have had a patient abduction" the security officer tells police according to a transcript of the call.'A cautionary tale'  The patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.   She and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo "medically kidnapped" her.   Unhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.   According to police Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in "gaining guardianship of Alyssa" who was an adult.A spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo supplied that form to CNN. Alyssa signed the form but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead she provided a statement which said in part "We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient."Read the Mayo Clinic's entire statement to CNN.This story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family a family friend law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.   By everyone's account this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.   "It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly" said Richard Saver a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.    Art Caplan head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine also reviewed the documents and he agrees.  "This should never have happened" he said. "This is a cautionary tale."    A Christmas Day aneurysm  The relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.   On Christmas morning 2016 Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother Amber Engebretson a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson her stepfather since she was 4 years old who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings then 18 months to 11 years old.  They live in Sherburn Minnesota population just over 1000 people about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis on a farm with sheep cows horses and pigs.  Alyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America her favorite club.   Then she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.  "Mom I need you!" Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor vomiting.  It was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.  "You could see looking at her that she was petrified" her stepfather said.   He called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa who'd always been healthy had a ruptured brain aneurysm: A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.  Surgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. A nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it she said.  Amber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.   They begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester Minnesota.  "They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo" said Alyssa's mother Amber Engebretson who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.   But Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive and helicopters couldn't fly.  The weather eventually broke and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.  On Christmas night surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was "grim."Her parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the  #Christmasmiraclegirl.  Alyssa lived up to that name. She survived thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.   "They were like she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds" her stepfather said.   "Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life" added her mother. "We'll be grateful to them forever."On January 30 Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.It should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.  Tensions flare  Although all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.  First doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.  "She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain" her stepfather said.  Many medical authorities including the Mayo Clinic's website say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.  A week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.  "[Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes" Amber wrote on February 7.More disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.  Her parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.  "We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us" Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.  Alyssa's parents say that at their request they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.   "I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered tests left undone and every other question we could think of" Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.Amber says that at one point during that meeting she told the staff she felt like they "don't give a f***" later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter. "We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point" Amber wrote on Facebook that night. Mayo kicks Mom out  On February 22 the day after that meeting Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.  That afternoon Amber says she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care. Amber had requested the meeting and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.  Amber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected the man and the social worker were talking about her family.  "I proceeded to open the door and say 'Since you're talking about my family I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also to be included in the conversation' " she remembers.  She says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her and she took a backward step into the hall. The man who Amber later learned was a physician demanded that she leave.  She says the man told her "I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?"  Amber describes the doctor as "intensely aggressive."  She replied to him she says with similar aggression and frustration: "I need to talk to you. Do you understand me?" The doctor walked away. CNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.  About an hour later Alyssa's parents say the same doctor the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.  "[The doctor] said to me 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now' " Amber remembers.  Amber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.  Later a social worker would tell police that "Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property."According to Alyssa's parents the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.  The couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.  "He said 'There is no patient advocate' and walked away" Amber said.  When asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.  "Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients. As a general practice this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted."Plumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.  "We would never compromise her care" Amber said. "She's our daughter. We love her."  She also says she never put staff members at risk. "We would never do that -- ever" she said. On February 23 the day after Amber was kicked out she went on Facebook.   "PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us" she wrote."I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why no paperwork and no explanations" she continued. "I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!"The response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo and fast.   'Basically a prisoner at Mayo'  Alyssa who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization says that around this time she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.  She says she never received a response.   "They were cruel to me" Alyssa said adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo "as bad as possible."   On February 23 three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab Amber complained on Facebook tagging Mayo.   "They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged" she wrote. "No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo."Alyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.  "I asked two to three times a day and it would go nowhere" Duane said.   "Duane said 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here' " her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. "But there was no response."  Duane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.   "He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem' " Duane remembers. "I even asked him 'can I speak to your supervisor your boss' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room and that was it.'  Duane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.    Olson Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.  "She was truly being held captive" Olson said. "I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams."  The family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.  Two nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa and they kept careful watch according to visitors.  "It was like they were watching every move you made" said Joy Schmitt Alyssa's boyfriend's mother who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.  'They were taking over our daughter' On February 21 the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.Around this time a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa according to the police. If they had succeeded she would have become a ward of the state.Alyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.  On February 26 staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.  The same day Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa according to Duane and Amber's sister April Chance who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.   Duane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.   "The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit" Duane said.  The family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions such as physical and occupational therapy.   "I said 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on' " her aunt remembers. "And they said 'No you're impeding her care.' "   She said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.  "They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter" Duane said.   Mayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date which was supposed to be February 27.  Meanwhile her mother's following was growing on Facebook with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.   One woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.   Articles in The Boston Globe and elsewhere described how in 2013 Pelletier then 14 years old was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward. Amber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.   Through their lawyer John T. Martin the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.   A spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is "committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being" and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.  Amber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles. "OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening" Amber wrote. "It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared."  A Mayo board member steps in  Alyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont Minnesota.  Gaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president. He informed her of the situation and explained that CNN had contacted the family.    "Could you please please do what you can to get your arms around the [situation] immediately?!" he wrote. "Please get to the bottom of this quickly before it blows up even more."But Gaalswyk's pull wasn't enough. He says Mayo treated Alyssa "terribly.""I'm probably the most pro-Mayo person who has walked the face of this earth" said Gaalswyk who left the board January 1. "But this was a mess."He said he thinks Amber probably "used words she shouldn't have" with hospital staff. "I'm not saying that Amber is 100 percent in the right" he added "but I know what Mayo did is not OK at all."In its statement to CNN the Mayo spokeswoman said that "Mayo Clinic is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all the patients we treat."Feeling like they were running out of options Alyssa's parents then enlisted the help of Karie Rego an attorney and patient advocate they'd met on Facebook.  On February 27 Rego spoke on the phone with Joshua Murphy Mayo's chief legal officer and faxed him a letter urging Mayo to transfer Alyssa to another facility.  "Given what has happened here an expedited transfer this coming week would be best for everyone" she wrote.Rego says an attorney in Murphy's office called her later. She says that he told her he  couldn't speak with her and that she never heard anything more from Mayo's legal department.   That night Alyssa's parents thought about Justina Pelletier and the 16 months she spent in state custody. They went online and printed a form for Alyssa to sign saying she was leaving the hospital against medical advice. But her parents didn't know how they would get her out. Two nurses were assigned to keep watch over her at all times. They started to hatch a plan to get her out of Mayo the very next day.Read the second part of "Escape from the Mayo Clinic." ,Health
This is the second part of the series"Escape from the Mayo Clinic." Read the first part here. Sherburn Minnesota (CNN)One winter afternoon last year Duane Engebretson sat in his stepdaughter's hospital room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota trying to figure out how she could escape. Alyssa Gilderhus 18 and a senior in high school had been a patient at Mayo for about two months ever since having a ruptured brain aneurysm on Christmas Day. Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life but she and her parents were unhappy with the care she was receiving in the rehabilitation unit and they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred. But they say Mayo refused to let her transfer to another hospital even after a lawyer wrote a letter asking Mayo to make the arrangements. Alyssa and her family began to suspect that Mayo was trying to get a guardian appointed to make medical decisions for her. They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements. Duane and his wife Amber Engebretson weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times. But on February 28 2017 an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room. He looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.  Betty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile. If he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room it might just sound believable he figured.  He put his plan into action about 4 p.m. with his 9-year-old daughter Allie secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.  Duane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.The video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.Two women in scrubs follow them.When the group arrives in the lobby there is no Grandma Betty.  Duane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.As he approaches the car the front passenger door opens.There is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat."Alyssa we're going to go home honey. Come on" Amber says to her daughter.As Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat the two women in scrubs run toward her and someone yells "No!" "Yes she is! Yes she is!" Duane and Amber yell back.The video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her."Get your hands off my daughter" Duane yells at the aide.Duane closes the car door and gets in the back seat."Get out of here Amber" he tells his wife. "Go go go go go go!"The car drives away from Mayo.  Recalling her escape some months later Alyssa says it felt "phenomenal.""It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders" she said. 'We have a patient abduction' At 4:28 p.m. a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.  "We have a patient abduction" the caller said. An officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later. A Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa "cannot make decisions for herself" and that her mother couldn't care for her "because Amber has mental health issues."The social worker also told police she "understood there was no formal diagnosis" for Amber.Amber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.  "It's absolutely absurd" Amber said. "She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification." The social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties "trying to get emergency guardianship" but had been unable to get court orders to do so.An Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that "Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa." But something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.  If Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself as the social worker had said and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?  When police asked that question of Mayo staffers Sherwin said they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.   "When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient" Sherwin said.  He said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa "in fact could make decisions on her own" -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.  "There was no abduction. This was done under her own will" he said. "You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning."Though satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions Sherwin still was concerned about her health.  "What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital" Sherwin said.Mayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves. But first the police had to find Alyssa.  Police search for Alyssa  Alyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones and they weren't at home either.They later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.  "We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again" Duane said. Unable to find the family the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato Minnesota about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa according to a Mankato police report.It turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart purchasing a wheelchair a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube which Duane says he'd been trained to use.  They then checked into a nearby hotel.  While at the hotel the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked. The deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them according to the family. Alyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel. It was now almost 9 p.m. and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels. As Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway a sheriff's deputy called urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson about 75 miles away. But then the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility. After the calls from police Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.   They got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.  "I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later" he said. 'This kid is in danger'  The next afternoon March 1 one of Alyssa's doctors a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim a Rochester police investigator.The doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger."The longer she's away the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very very sick" the physician said according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN. The day Alyssa left Mayo that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.  "Alyssa's medical condition medical status cognition and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care" the doctors wrote. "She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather."Alyssa was at risk for pneumonia malnourishment dehydration aspiration infection and falling according to the note. She didn't have her medications with her and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube according to the discharge summary.The doctor said Alyssa was probably "a ways from here by now" and requested a wider-scale search."[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor" the doctor said."We wouldn't do that nationally" Bush-Seim responded. "That wouldn't be done."Without a national search the doctor said "we're not gonna find her."Bush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had "done everything they possibly could to find her.""There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger" Alyssa's doctor responded.The police back off But other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician. Less than 12 hours after leaving Mayo she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.  They explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice according to medical records from that emergency room visit. The Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.  Although Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.Mayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment. When police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home they stepped aside. "If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion that kind of takes the law out of it" said Chris Vasvick a Martin County sheriff's deputy. "That's one doctor's opinion against another and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all." Sherwin the Rochester detective agreed.  "We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene" Sherwin said.He added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them."As parents they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest" Sherwin said.   A few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room Alyssa and her parents went home.  A letter from Mayo was waiting for them thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.   The family found it ironic given that it was dated  March 1 the day after Alyssa left the hospital.  A few days later another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.  "We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo" the administrator wrote.  On Facebook Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.  "This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!!" she wrote.'Hospitals aren't prisons' To understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case CNN showed experts key documents including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.  The experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture. "You're only hearing one side" cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner a professor of pediatrics medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.After reviewing the documents the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa who was 18 and legally an adult to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred according to the family.  They said that typically adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice and they can leave without signing any paperwork. "Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will" said George Annas an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.  But Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.   "Due to the severity of her brain injury she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions" her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.  In that report the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked "the capacity to decide to sign releases of information make pain medication dose changes and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice." That hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions yet in the discharge note they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.  It didn't jibe with the experts either.  "They can't eat their cake and have it too" said Feudtner the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.Even if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa. Brian Smith the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa. "The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her" he told CNN. If that happened Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo as she was already receiving treatment there Smith said.  Bush-Seim the Rochester police investigator spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.  The legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient they said rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.  Robert McLeod a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa as he did not want to comment on any specific case.  He said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.  "From my 25 years of experience a judge is going to say 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason" said McLeod an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul Minnesota. Other experts agreed. Saver the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.  "It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy" Saver said. "I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to." Alyssa said her biological father Jason Gilderhus told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.   Even if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out there were other friends and relatives to turn to such as her stepfather grandmother great-grandmother aunt or boyfriend's mother.  "It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian" added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.Another feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.  Caplan the NYU bioethicist said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.   An ethics committee would listen to the doctors other staff members the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.   The family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.   Annas the lawyer at Boston University agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control. "Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time and they can either escalate or de-escalate" Annas said. "An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate."  The experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case the conflict escalated. "I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital" said Cochran of the University of California.  "I felt sad" said Feudtner the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. "Viewed in its entirety this did not go well for anybody who was involved."Gaalswyk the former Mayo board member said he hopes the hospital learns something. "I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo" he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. "The situation need not get out of hand like it did." Being 'held hostage in an American hospital'  While the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways according to patient advocates.  Dr. Julia Hallisy founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.    "You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital" she said. "People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story."  Kristen Spyker said it happened to her family.  When Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.   She said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.  "The surgeon said 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss and I say what happens' " she said.  She said a social worker accompanied by hospital security guards then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.  Spyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action. Her son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor. When she told her story on Facebook Spyker said other parents shared similar stories.  "It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us'" she said. "They had been so embarrassed to talk about it but they felt freer when I said it happened to us."  Spyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while  their daughter was at Mayo.  In a statement to CNN the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.  "Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment" said Dr. Jay Bhatt senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. "Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for."When hospitals and families get into intense conflict Hallisy a dentist who practices in San Francisco says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter Katherine was being treated for cancer.  "People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements but they're human beings and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over" she said.  She said that in Alyssa's case she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer perhaps a social worker could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.  She thinks back to her daughter who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital. She thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away as well as farms and a family business to run.  "They were under incredible stress" Hallisy said. "They'd almost lost a child and they had other responsibilities too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that."  The prom queen graduatesMore than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic Alyssa now 20 has belied her "grim prognosis." Last year she graduated from Martin County West High School receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award. Her feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.  She finished up her physical and speech therapy in March about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.Alyssa has not filed a lawsuit but has engaged Martin the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.  Alyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital. "I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her" her stepfather said. They say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.   They think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff especially a senior physician.    "I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what" her mother said.   She's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.  "We stand by it 100 percent" her stepfather said. ,Health
 (CNN)As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face she could feel the wound.Her vision is greatly impaired due to her injury but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat. She could feel where her face was swollen. She could feel the portions that were missing.That was before Katie at 21 became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant performed last year aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.Now Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.She is featured on the cover of National Geographic magazine's September issue which debuted Tuesday in an article titled "The Story of a Face" and in National Geographic's full-length documentary "Katie's Face."'I had no clue what a face transplant was'In the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt she faced a number of emotional hurdles. She underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship. Around that time Katie's mother Alesia was abruptly fired from a teaching job at Katie's school because Alesia "questioned several decisions that were made lacking integrity" Katie's father Robb told CNN.On March 25 2014 when Katie was 18 her older brother Robert Stubblefield heard the gunfire and found her after she harmed herself in a bathroom at his home in Mississippi.He was devastated.Katie doesn't remember that tragic day when she lost her face. She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later. It was in Memphis where Katie's parents Robb and Alesia heard the term "face transplant" for the first time. "There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind' and he said 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant' " Robb said. "I was standing there thinking 'What do you mean a face transfer? What do you do?' "When Katie was later told about the possible procedure she said she was equally stunned."I had no clue what a face transplant was" Katie said. "When my parents helped explain everything to me I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again."Full and partial face transplants are medical procedures that involve replacing all or parts of a person's face with donated tissue including skin bone nerves and blood vessels from a deceased donor.Katie's procedure involved transplanting the scalp forehead upper and lower eyelids eye sockets nose upper cheeks upper jaw and half of lower jaw upper teeth lower teeth partial facial nerves muscles and skin -- effectively replacing her full facial tissue according to Cleveland Clinic.Similar to Katie the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient Connie Culp underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.That was a near-total face transplant. The world's first successful full face transplant was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona Spain in 2010.As for where Katie fits in "only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant and we believe that she is the 39th person" said Susan Goldberg editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine."We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year" Goldberg said of the magazine. "We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science."'You take it for granted the different components of our faces'Before Katie's face transplantation surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw said Dr. Brian Gastman a plastic surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.The surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister Olivia McCay to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction."We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant" Gastman said.He noted that when he first saw Katie's injury he worried that she might not live.In March 2016 Katie was placed on the waiting list for a face transplant. Fourteen months later a donor was found: Adrea Schneider a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose National Geographic reported. Before the procedure Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor. After she was cleared to receive her new face the 31-hour surgery began May 4 2017. It involved 11 surgeons several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day."I am able to touch my face now and it feels amazing" said Katie who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.Her father Robb translated some of her sentiments: "You take it for granted the different components of our faces -- the bone the tissue the muscle everything -- but when it's gone you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant you're so thankful."Katie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of transplant rejection which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.Katie also continues physical and occupational therapy works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons."I'm definitely taking many many daily steps" Katie said of her rehab progress adding that her family has been a big help in her recovery and that her faith has kept her strong."Life is precious and life is beautiful" she said.Face transplantation is considered experimental and insurance companies Medicare and Medicaid don't cover it. A grant from the US Department of Defense through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine covered Katie's transplant according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including face transplantation -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women."I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One because of the type of wound that she suffered but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers" Robb said. "She's in that late-teen to early 20s where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured."While Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation there are many other hopes for her future.Katie plans to attend college online soon possibly followed by a career in counseling and motivational speaking. She hopes to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention."My first wish for Katie is to be happy" Gastman said. "That's number one but beyond that I'd like her to have some level of normalcy" he said. "Then she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects -- for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are. Further on the other hand how much a singular rash decision made by so many young people today could negatively change your whole life."He said Katie "had the ultimate second chance."Suicide awareness remains critical said Katie's mother Alesia.Globally close to 800000 people die due to suicide every year which is about one person every 40 seconds according to the World Health Organization. In the US suicide rates significantly climbed in 44 states from 1999 through 2016 according to a report published in June by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 45000 lives were lost to suicide in 2016 and more than half of people who died by suicide did not have a known mental health condition.In 2016 guns were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the US accounting for 22963 -- almost half of all -- suicide deaths according to the National Institute of Mental Health.Among young people "I think we do a pretty decent job of educating them about sex and about drinking and driving" but education around suicide prevention is lacking Alesia said."I can honestly tell you for Katie we do not believe for one moment that she wanted to die" Alesia said. "But we do believe she hit that low where she definitely tried and thought about it and for a moment -- 20 seconds or less -- kids can make those decisions.",Health
Petersburg Indiana (CNN)When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control she said her doctor was a "cheerleader" for one option and one option only: Essure.Potts says the device which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.It was so bad that she had a hysterectomy removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.Last week the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.Potts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?A CNN analysis of federal data shows that from August 2013 through December 2017 Bayer paid 11850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.These payments are legal but very controversial.Potts' doctor was one of the highest earners according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.More than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service one of just three doctors to earn more than $100000.The financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that but the database doesn't go back that far and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years."I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal $5000 to $7000 a year" she said.Basinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.Studies by scientists at the University of North Carolina Yale University the George Washington University and Harvard Medical School among others show that when doctors are paid by pharmaceutical companies they're more likely to prescribe drugs made by those companies.In those studies the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money."I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way" she said.She said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it."I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money" she said. "A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians."She added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.Bayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will pull the device off the market and that it stands by the safety of its product.But according to a US Food and Drug Administration statement put out the same day the device has been associated with "serious risks including persistent pain perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen."Bayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices "The Bleeding Edge."On Friday Bayer posted a "fact check" to the documentary which states that the film "presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure."Also Friday the pharmaceutical company published an "Open Letter to Patients and Providers About Essure" which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure "was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women."The Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.Their private Facebook group Essure Problems has more than 37000 members including more than 12000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device according to group founder Angie Firmalino.'I felt like she was very pushy'When Potts who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg Indiana gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006 she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.Potts then 27 asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear."She was very upbeat about it" Potts said. "I felt like she was very pushy."She and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches joint pain abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.She said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child then 8 to help with her three younger children."It was hard" she said.Since the hysterectomy her symptoms have almost completely gone away she said.Potts says she's angry that in her memory Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied also known as tubal ligation the other option for permanent female birth control.She felt "violated" because she felt that her choice was taken away."I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision more or less because she said that this was best and I wasn't really given another option" she said.Basinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures."In my notes I did document that I talked about risks benefits and alternatives with her" Basinski said.Another patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient who requested not to be named to protect her privacy later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.Basinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation."We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits" she said. "It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other."But Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.In 2009 she appeared on "The Balancing Act" a television show aimed at women along with Trista Sutter a former "Bachelorette" contestant who had been implanted with the device.The host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure."Well I'm going to tell you something because of Miss Trista here I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure" Basinski said. "When women find out about this they want this procedure."CNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure. "Knowing Dr. Basinski I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them" said Cindy Dossett who was implanted with Essure in 2008. "I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to and I wouldn't say that about all doctors."'That looks like a bribe'In a statement to CNN Bayer said that "close cooperation with and continuous education of healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help."The statement added that health care professionals "are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities."Friday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts.   "These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure" it states. "They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase prescribe or otherwise support Essure."Dr. Martin Makary a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research he doubted that the more than 11000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts."That looks like a bribe" he said. "That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors."Data on EssureThe FDA estimates that Essure has been used by more than 750000 patients worldwide since it was approved on November 4 2002. At the time Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc. which Bayer acquired in June 2013. From 2002 through 2017 the patient problems most frequently reported to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21215) heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9846) headache (7231) fatigue (5842) and weight fluctuations (4970).According to the FDA reported adverse events "cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence severity or frequency of problems associated with devices" and "confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report."In April the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.Basinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year."I think it is a safe and viable option for women and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option" she said.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional comments from Bayer and added detail on the adverse event reporting process for medical devices.,Health
San Francisco California (CNN)Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids. So it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013 nearly five years later Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son Henry one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later with their newborn in their arms they exchanged vows and were legally married. Having Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers they needed a support group legal help extensive research reams of documents reproductive science and about $150000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate. One embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday. Then came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.The fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.The eggs she wasn't usingTaroli 47 was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood he was open to a variety of options.Li however was keen on having a biological child making the decision of how to proceed easy Taroli said. Henry "got his sperm and my name."  They scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center studying pictures and written statements. They settled on "Isabelle" a name chosen by the potential donor and elected to sit down with her in person. She was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially as she had family support and scholarships but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.Isabelle the name she preferred to go by for this story also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more."Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them" she said by Skype from the United Kingdom where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. "I thought 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'"She also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who without someone else's eggs might never have children.Isabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs."No no no -- don't do it" Isabelle remembered her pleading. "What's the point?" She ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7000 to $8000 each time she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections. Most of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle the experience she appreciated most went to two men who chose her.She was excited to meet the people "who wanted my eggs to be part of their family" she said. When they got together in the clinic offices Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li who didn't want to speak for this story sat by with a clipboard she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.Isabelle now 29 has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.Capable but 'not interested in carrying my own'They came to know their embryos well including their sexes through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings which measured their viability and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents. Next Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.  A traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process if they chose a carrier who also lived in California would be less legally complicated for the gay dads Taroli explained.  The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead both of their names would. A few hours north of Castro Valley the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family in which the women generally have five or six kids and her pregnancy had been "really really easy" she said.An article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.The surrogate asked to be identified as "Audrey" to protect her privacy. "I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable" Audrey said. "It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own." Her husband whom she's been with for more than 16 years also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother Audrey said was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother however were completely on board. It was her father divorced from her mother and living several states away who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before and Audrey then 30 was prepared to move forward. It wasn't about the money for her although the $27000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.She'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth. The agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.With her husband and 3-year-old son with her Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward sort of like heading into a blind date she said."They brought me flowers which was really sweet" she remembered. "You could tell how much they were trying to impress me."Like her husband who works in IT so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up they shared their histories and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate not just during the pregnancy but after a proposition that made her smile. She left feeling like in them she'd found her match. 'Not just a vessel for their child'After some additional testing at the fertility center Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.  She laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her she said and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary. Eating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers. For many people in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch. She Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit the two men would take her and her family out to dinner. "They really valued me" Audrey said. "They saw me as a person not just a vessel for their child."She recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant someone asked her son "Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother?" The young boy answered without skipping a beat "That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby." As her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room she held off on pushing and screamed out "Are the dads here? Are they here?" A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.Audrey and her husband who was also in the room watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper."They were so funny" Audrey now 36 remembered. "They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son and it was so cute to see that in someone else." Audrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.She and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other but they still get updates and pictures. 'He's not my son'Isabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs still.  And as a result they've seen pictures of one another as they're both central to Henry's story. Isabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey."I remember thinking she had my egg inside of her" she said. "That's just crazy." Isabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1½. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry."I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being" said Taroli who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.The clinic in turn put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.Isabelle's mother who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy. That would come later. The first visit with Taroli Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone. As she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe "This is my baby" she said. "But then when I got there and I saw Henry he couldn't have cared less" she said with a laugh. "I was just another person in the room. Yes he's genetically my son but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me." She tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and "is probably more attached to him than I am" Isabelle said. Sometimes she wonders if Taroli and Li had had a girl whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.Taroli and Li told her at one point that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use."It would be quite ironic wouldn't it?" asked Isabelle who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos if she needed them someday stayed in the back of her mind.An ocean between them Taroli was texting with his mom with his television on in the background when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage he said to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland Ohio.He had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction so did San Francisco.He fired off an email to the fertility clinic not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li who is establishing a new business in China was abroad so Taroli sent him a message too with a link to the TV segment. A day or two later Taroli said he got a late evening call from the clinic confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed however would take further testing. To test an embryo requires that it be thawed first which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK they could hope that the others were too. "So we did that" Taroli said over coffee in April. "They all came back dead." With thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them the couple processed what this meant for them."They were viable lives. They were potential babies four boys and a girl that if we chose to could have been our kids" Taroli said. "It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility." And it's the death of what might have been for Henry who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.Taroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son who recently turned 5 and the extra big hugs he was getting. "If I get upset he cries" Taroli said. "I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him." Breaking the newsIt was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start and they deserved to know how it ended.Before he got to Isabelle though she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know out of the blue whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately. If the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit she said she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.The exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.When she woke up at 4 a.m. she said she had an email from Taroli telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again he wondered. The clinic contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions would not comment for this story.The news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle."For some reason I kept thinking about the little girl egg" she said and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. "They would never become people. But then I guess we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people right?"Isabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again her eggs were theirs.Audrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child but she hated that the option was taken away from them.Because her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.After that she said she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li."They were so great and I love them so much" Audrey said. "I would do it a million times over again for them." Taroli and Li knew this.'Happy with where we are'Pacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round and their doctor whom they don't blame in any way was eager to have them go through the process again. But Taroli and Li after processing the shock mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now have decided they aren't interested in going through this again. They're getting older they love their life with Henry Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart and now is not the time for them to have more children.The truth is they may have never used those embryos but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms."If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet our thinking might have been different" Taroli said. "We're happy with where we are." Meantime attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again. "I work in tech where lives aren't on the line" Taroli said. "You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens." He doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies and he knows that for some for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.But for him and Li they will love the child they do have stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here. And someday when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings they'll find the words to explain. ,Health
Columbia South Carolina (CNN)Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room. She points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior a small sculpture of her riding a wolf. At 13 Emmy has undergone an awakening. Just months ago she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive. She was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.The very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her."It's horrifying to know that every day you would give your child a medicine that in essence could kill them" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. "It's just really scary."For Emmy every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable. The first time she was given an insulin shot she stopped breathing fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout "I'll be a good girl!""We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive" her parents would say.For nine years she suffered like this. Beyond the pain she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much she struggled with memory and an array of other issues. Her parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.Desperate her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. "Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin while we find a solution to her allergy" Jack Reeves wrote.More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.  Emmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes.  He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.But that email set in motion a chain of events resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes. "It's amazing. She's a totally different child" her mother said. "Every day that she does not reject this organ I'm going to hug her even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her."'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'Kandaswamy the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father "like it was yesterday."Kandaswamy who has two daughters himself felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child.  But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.Only nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done  in a child this young he said was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor Dr. David Sutherland who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.  "Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children" Kandaswamy said. But his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself " 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question and you will get your answer."Kandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. "I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy" he said. "Looking at her you could see: 'Hey if this was your daughter what would you do?'"You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling" said Kandaswamy who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. "Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival."He had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital and if the surgery didn't go as planned the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted."There was a huge amount of apprehension" Kandaswamy said. "I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well."A team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons anesthesiologists nephrologists allergists transplant coordinators pain management specialists and others. After a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life. "We didn't make the decision without due thought and process" Kandaswamy said. "We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here."Kandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child the surgical techniques and post-transplant  management have advanced to the point that his team could "successfully perform a transplant in a child this young."A healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks including the possibility her body would reject the organ."Pediatric patients they have very active immune systems and they will try to spit out any kind of organ" Kandaswamy said.Emmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available. Before she headed north though Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana feast on a steak in Texas visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California where she once lived. The family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list. It was her parents say a farewell trip should she not survive.False alarms and the magic momentEmmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available. Three times the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.At one low point Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still she battled on.Then came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9 Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves her favorite animal with her tutor at a museum. Mom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well. At the hospital Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic. Emmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived. About 3 a.m. Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. "I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good" he said. On Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.As Emmy underwent surgery Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes. The surgery took more than four hours. "It was a great great feeling when we got her done" Kandaswamy said. "But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point."The doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed "Player 2" -- worked properly that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.She responded well the first week but in the second week after the transplant her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it."I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection" her mother said. "We're not sure what's going to happen in the future."They decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. "We're already down the rabbit hole Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do" Emmy said.Ever since her pancreas has functioned as hoped.Dr. Melina Bellin the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy said it was "touch-and-go" early on but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around."It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted" she said. "It definitely makes it that much better when it does."Kandaswamy added "We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around."With the healthy new pancreas he said her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and "blunting her consciousness" Kandaswamy said. "Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming" he said. "It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way."One of the greatest moments of his career Kandaswamy said was when Emmy hugged him: "There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up give me a hug and say 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard."Pancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. "I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness" he said.Speaking up to help othersIn the family home in Columbia South Carolina Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister Abby. "She's getting a childhood finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid" her mother said. "I mean this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years."The family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she. "If our experience could help even one kid I think it would be worth it" Tiffanie said.Emmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. "We still live life and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to" her father said. Emmy hopes to be a zoologist one day. For now she's shy around CNN's camera and doesn't want to talk with cameras rolling. When they're off she stands next to a window overlooking her backyard and a decaying swing set.She says she's drawn sketches of what she envisions back there: a greenhouse a new swing set a fire pit and a fence. When the Make-A-Wish Foundation reached out she told them she didn't want to travel anywhere fancy or meet a famous star. Instead she shared her vision of a new backyard a place where she can finally be herself.,Health
Petros Tennessee (CNN)Fifty years ago a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him. While King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace) Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away. Over the next two months while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List Ray was on the run traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee surrounded by thick wooded hills. In its day it was considered one of the toughest state prisons where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel "The Silence of the Lambs" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.Brushy was also nearly impossible to escape but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days though "rescued" is probably the better description. Cold hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from "The Great Escape" to "Blair Witch Project." Ray himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days a detail that made one local long-distance runner Gary Cantrell think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.And thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted. Man vs. landCantrell whose nickname is "Lazarus Lake" or "Laz" as he is known by everyone was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name "brushy" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts bruises and falls. It's so dense you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.These mountains where a day hike can be a challenge are where truly competitive racing should be held he thought not on a flat paved well-marked course.The Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told it has about 67000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29000 feet -- not that the other 67000 feet of descent are much easier. The loops are run back to back over three sleepless days and nights on unmarked trails. Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes aid stations teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish but the Barkley is designed so racers fail. And fail they do. Of more than 1000 who've entered only 15 have completed the full distance in time. "It's a good place for your ego to take a beating" Laz said before this year's race sporting a red beanie labeled "Geezer." His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight like the Yoda of the runner's world.  Among ultramarathoners the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective of course. There are footraces that cross deserts traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.It's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.How it works (or doesn't)For a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down of course) all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:No GPS or phones. The only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch.Unmanned checkpoints (13 this year) which are paperback books. You rip out the page that corresponds to your bib number to prove that you reached it. You must have all the book pages in hand at the end of each loop. The books are hidden under rocks or taped to trees usually. 60-hour cutoff. Two years ago Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go arriving at the campground a few seconds over time disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route.No aid stations. Philosophical Laz: "Being totally free doesn't come without risk."No outside assistance. No friends and family to meet you with food or socks except at the camp between loops. No hints as to the location of checkpoints or map secrets. This year's theme according to cackling Yoda-esque Laz: "Help is not coming." Start time TBD. A conch is blown one hour before the race starts but that can be anywhere between midnight and noon. "The uncertainty is half the fun" Laz said with a chortle "and one of the hardest things to deal with."Entry fee is $1.60 a pair of socks (this year) and an essay. Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars but Laz isn't in it for the money though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.Thousands apply every year and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website email or physical address posted anywhere. Would-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete and Laz chooses among these factoring in their arguments or in some cases poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted runners get a "letter of condolence" and told the date of the race (also a secret) and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.'Good luck morons'This year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements. Four or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as "Where Do We Go From Here" and "A Time to Die." I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read "You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff unless it is foggy then you will have to guess."Chicken and beans cooked over an open fire were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read "Good luck morons."Because you don't know when the race is going to start it makes for a fitful night's sleep lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.Mercifully or just randomly Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m. under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start Laz gave few remarks none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years Laz removed his hat and a bugler played taps the traditional song of military funerals.Tradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or as Laz described it "the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that it turns ugly."Although he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon) Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley for whom he named the race. '4/5 Pure Joy 1/5 Pure Hell' The details of the race are a well-guarded secret and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map. The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.The race takes place every spring a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing. "This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog" Laz said pausing for his punch line: "at the same time." This year it started pleasantly cool and cloudy but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.Between each loop runners will eat doctor their feet maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops two are clockwise two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop five made it to the third loop and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out a bugler played taps. Like some previous years it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.Finishing is so rare there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune 2011's only finisher calculated "4/5 Pure Joy 1/5 Pure Hell." Andrew Thompson finished in 2009 after setting the speed record for the 2160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47½ days. "Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected" he wrote. "All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick and cold and damn happy to be done."Only one person Jared Campbell has finished the race three times. "I am thrilled" he said after finishing in 2016 "setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60." In 2014 he was more philosophical: "There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life." And in 2012 he was nearly psychedelic: "Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts which was both an educational and beautiful experience."In 2013 finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: "The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself." 'A different breed'To reach the Barkley you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual "human sacrifice" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals also known as periodization building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: "100% self-extraction") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia. Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley plenty of other gear is including compasses walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that "snapped in two" Laz said and the runner still finished the loop. "It's a different breed" he cackled.Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners according to a recent study by the University of California Davis and Stanford University though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1212 active ultrarunners in the study injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40) less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies hay fever and exercise-induced asthma probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general running is outstanding cardio exercise benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.As for the mental rewards -- well that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A "sense of accomplishment" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line it most certainly means going through hell to get there.,Health
 (CNN)With a drop of a pan Shalom Blac's life changed forever."I remember just screaming and scraping my body and my skin was literally falling on the floor" Blac said.  "I remember my mom telling me that I fainted. She thought I was gone."When she was 9 Shalom and her younger sister were napping under a table at their mother's restaurant in Nigeria. Her mom unaware of the sleeping girls below placed a pot of hot oil on the table. Someone accidentally knocked the pot over scalding the sisters.  The girls were rushed to the hospital severely burned. Eventually an aunt got them visas so they could come to the United States and undergo several surgeries. A dark placeAfter the accident Shalom's life took a "huge huge turn.""Kids that I used to play with they were either scared of me or some would call me 'monster' and 'two-face' and just laugh. I started thinking about committing suicide because of the bullying." As a little girl Shalom loved playing with her mother's makeup. But she first learned how to properly wear it during her hospital stay in the United States."They were teaching me how to do makeup even though I wasn't good. I used to just have concealer all over my face and go to school. It was horrible."Then one day while watching YouTube she came across cosmetics tutorials that changed her life. "That's how I picked up on how to do a lot of different stuff. And I started applying that to how I want my makeup to look and how I want to look with makeup. " A girl in one particular YouTube video really struck a nerve. "She was a young girl who was battling cancer and she was completely bald. I was just like 'Oh my how is she so young and so brave to come on camera in a public place?' So I just decided to challenge myself and do the thing that scares me the most." Shalom started making her own YouTube videos. Without makeup she let the world see her as she is scars and all. "I just decided to do a video and then post a picture of me without my wig which was a big deal. I was so scared but seeing people tell me how my picture or my videos have inspired them really pushed me to do more and share with people." YouTube sensation Shalom's transformation videos in which she demonstrates how she uses makeup to change her looks went viral.

Portland Oregon (CNN)All Erika Zak wants to do is play with her daughter on the playground. Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.She's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.At 38 Erika is dying.Her battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter Loïe was born four years ago when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. The cancer was removed from her colon and her doctors say she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts. Every day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections bleeding and an array of other health issues.She has high blood pressure in her liver which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die. "Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding we all hold our breath worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?" says Dr. Skye Mayo her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University. "This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like."More than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver. After weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January Erika finally got her big break. On February 2 doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant. The news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house 4-year-old Loïe would say "Mommy when you get a new liver can you push me in the swing?"But Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer UnitedHealthcare denied coverage for the transplant saying it would not be a "promising treatment." She appealed and was rejected again. The mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Loïe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned: Dear LoïeIf you're reading this I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect warm breeze upon your sweet face.Erika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious. Outraged and heartbroken Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC) giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process riddled with errors that determined her life wasn't worth saving.Weeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea the answer was the same: Denied. Then last week an amazing thing happened. 'My life hangs in the balance'If it's true that opening your heart revealing your feelings unleashes freedom and makes you whole Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing. It was early April. She sat at her computer her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband Scott Powers and their daughter Loïe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible. There was too much at stake. UnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant saying "unproven health services is not a covered benefit." The words burned like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.The young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group David Wichmann. Her frame may be tiny but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet. As she typed Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for "my only option" a liver transplant."Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review" she wrote "it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC."She blasted what she called the "shockingly incompetent manner" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from "chemotherapy toxicity" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had "life-threatening lesions.""Neither are true" she wrote Wichmann. "(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays incomplete responses inept scheduling contradictory statements and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history. "Most importantly decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months." One review doctor noted she had a "9cm tumor" in her liver she wrote apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure. "I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along" Erika wrote. "Now when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest I need UHC's support more than ever."She sent the letter via FedEx on April 11. Her concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer but instead was the result of "a consequence of complications following microwave ablation."  "Of note what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity which was a secondary cause of liver failure."The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time."Two days after sending her letter Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review. Several times the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision. As time wore on Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2 the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.On Instagram she posted an illustration with the words "waiting waiting waiting" on a pink backdrop with black crosses. "Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver" she wrote. "Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved."'Wait or die'More than 100000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery said Dr. Andrew Cameron the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program. For liver transplants 20000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7000 will receive a new liver in 2018 according to Cameron who is not connected to Erika's case. "The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure" he said. "Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die."Transplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant Cameron said typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in. It is deeply disturbing he said when an insurance company overrules the "decision made by a thoughtful careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life."The negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200000 Cameron said adding it is "exceedingly rare" for an insurer to deny a transplant. "That is highly unusual and highly undesirable" Cameron told CNN. In Cleveland Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.   It's groundbreaking and could prove transformative. "I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent" he said.  When you're trying such a new approach Dr. Aucejo said it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done "in a more expeditious way."He explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with "unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer" but the "outcomes were not good."Only 18% of the patients lived past five years so the transplants were stopped Dr. Aucejo said. But he emphasized most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since he said.Doctors in Europe primarily in Norway have begun changing the field he said finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years. That is a substantial difference he said. Dr. Mayo Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process "to help explain the facts of her case." That is troubling he said especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see. "It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered" Dr. Mayo said. "Her life now is not limited by her cancer" he said. "It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant."When opposites attractErika was in the prime of her life. At 34 she'd given birth to her first and only child Loïe the little girl who Mom calls "my tiniest most amazing companion." She'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design both in Providence. The two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast she from the free-wheeling West Coast.The connection wasn't immediate so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it. Soon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her he found the woman who he'd always searched for with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth. They tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg California.  Her career was taking off too. She was working for Old Navy choosing and designing the fabrics prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant she was promoted to senior textile designer."It was all coming together" she wrote on her blog. "And then like that my foundation crumbled."During the final trimester of her pregnancy she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side. On April 8 2014 she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old. "Worst Day Ever" read the headline of her blog.She had survived cancer once before. At 28 she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis. In the years after her colon cancer diagnosis she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group."Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?" she wrote. In her blog posts she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy. She'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position screaming and sobbing. It was "anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself" she blogged. Her fingertips felt like they had been "burned on a hot pan most of the time." Her hands cramped into weird contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.As a teen she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times she said "I hoped that I could just disappear forever.""It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here" she wrote on December 1 2016 two and half years into her cancer battle. She would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28 2017 she wrote:"This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day." On another day she penned: "Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability."On April 4 2017 nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis but it remained in her liver. "Mommy are you going to last?" Loïe asked."What do you mean Loïe?""Will you be here forever and ever?" the girl asked."I really don't know babe."Six days later Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver. To save her life surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile. With bile going immediately outside her body instead of through the liver and her body Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds. "All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her" Dr. Mayo said. "She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids."The cancer in her liver meanwhile was progressing on a path he said where "she would die of cancer." She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment. Her doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab known by its brand name Keytruda.Her sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. "She had an incredible response to this new drug" Dr. Mayo said. "I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure."With a new liver he said her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone too.But transplant surgery is not without major risks. Most of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months. Most of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care like chemotherapy or surgery he said profoundly prolonging their lives. For a small subset of patients though the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery he said. "Unfortunately in that subset of patients the survival is more dismal."While it's impossible to predict the outcome he said Erika shows "features that may do well." There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver he said. Plus patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant Dr. Aucejo said tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: "That's a good indicator."Dr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise. "We're talking about distributing limited organs" he said. "Again we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs."'This is so messed up'In the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO her husband Scott worked the phones. He felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision. Finally they were told a decision would come May 2. Erika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message weeping for much of the video. "My life is literally in their hands and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more" she says. "I don't want to leave. I don't want to die."The next day came. Each minute crept by.Shortly after 2 p.m. Scott's phone rang. It was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.He had crushing news: Denied.He explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them he said "changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'" However the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: "The bottom line is they're upholding that decision."The doctor who sided in favor of the transplant their UHC contact told them was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon. Scott grew furious. "Honestly you know that is messed up" he said. "I don't know who you've got to go to but I would go to someone now and have someone call us because this is so messed up."Scott pressed for more information. He got little. "Scott I know what you've been through" the UHC rep told him. "I know what you're going through."Erika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words it was time to speak up. "Hey!" she shouted. "This is Erika and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying."Through tears she said "I need a liver transplant and I need it now."The UHC rep confided he "was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news." He suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies. "Someone needs to be accountable for this" he said. "You know why when we have these guidelines in place did we not follow them?"That needs to be looked into" he said adding "I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug."He apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note. "Like I said I wish I had better news." After more than 30 minutes he ended with: "Have a good night OK." Not the words the couple wanted to hear. Erika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings. Scott felt equally distraught. "I just want her to get a liver" he said. "She deserves that."The CEO never responded -- not by email phone or letter.A sudden changeFive days later on Monday May 7 a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Loïe for school when Scott's phone rang. They had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left and they didn't want to blow it. They hadn't sent any new information since the last call.It was their UHC rep on the phone. This time he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.When Scott heard she'd been approved he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room. There was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps. Erika called her mother who unleashed a guttural scream at work. Dr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors nurses and staff celebrated.In Cleveland Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial. "They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them" he said. "I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision."I had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.I was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. "UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever" Scott texted.  When we met a couple hours later Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now suddenly she has hope for more. Glancing at her daughter and husband Erika broke down in tears. "I can't imagine not being here" she said. "It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.""Mommy why are you crying?" Loïe said."I'm crying because I love you."Loïe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand. "Love you" Loïe said.As she and Loïe locked hands the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: "Be brave."EpilogueUnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case except to issue this one-sentence statement:"We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request."Even after the approval Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.It can mean the difference between life and death. "No one should have to fight and work that hard" she said "especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life."Since the approval the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.It's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a "MELD score" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority. Erika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range Dr. Aucejo said her transplant could be a few months away."But this varies a lot" he said. "There are many variables at play here."A patient for a liver transplant he said is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.Would Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?"That is very speculative at the least" Dr. Aucejo said. "I couldn't say that."He chose his words carefully saying it's a "complex dynamic" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance. "She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant."Dr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition. "It's a new territory" he told CNN. "I can't blame anybody."If Erika receives her transplant and succeeds Dr. Aucejo said she could help set precedent for many others down the road.More than anything she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be.,Health
La Jolla California (CNN)To face each day Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.But last month as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla California hotel room she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different. She'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother her best friend and her pit bull Daisy who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant. A year earlier Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery."It's not for me and never has been" she said at the time. She was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it. A series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching however have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire 21 needs new lungs or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept. The only question is: Did her change of heart come too late? Feeling trappedIt wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.She had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13 she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14 she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way she nurtured a love of travel.She was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.Doctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst. "You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain" she remembered them saying. "And I was like 'OK I got the message! Copy that!' " She took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.Cystic fibrosis affects more than 30000 people in the United States (and more than 70000 worldwide) according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The disease causes an overabundance of mucus which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs complicates digestion affects the pancreas and other organs and eventually leads to respiratory failure. Read: Living while dying: 'Little Buddha' wisdom from a terminally ill 'goofball'The median survival age is about 40 according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare. Claire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes endured as best she could the feeding tube at night even though it made her throw up and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily she said she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day. But even with all of this her lung function continued to decline. In one year she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.CFers as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis often talk about "the Wheelchair Decision" with dread Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February it initially felt "like freedom." With her best friend Larissa taking on the role of "designated wheeler" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach where Claire lives visiting the canals going to the park soaking in the ocean breeze.And while most of the time she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair there are accessibility issues the sidewalks are a mess and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably she's had those moments when she thinks "It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far."Then Claire who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia. Though the portacath was fixable Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously."I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything" she remembered feeling with a panic. "I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die."Ready for the raceAfter leaving the La Jolla hotel Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team. She'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then she was eager to tell them why this time was different. A nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator Megan Serletti spent several hours educating Claire her mom and Larissa about the process. They talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list some of which Claire knew well and described as "gnarly." They discussed the lung allocation score the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.They discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center the importance of not ignoring phone calls the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule."We call a transplant your marathon" Serletti said. "We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race."There were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute? "I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money" Claire quipped. "Way to bring the hustle."How about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C a condition that is treatable?"Honestly I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else" she said. "I already have the body of someone who's been around the block." Serletti spoke of the realities after surgery including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life the physical and emotional challenges she might face the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor. Claire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up "Don't Panic" logo from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." "None of it spooked me" Claire said afterward over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. "Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything."'We both just started crying'To qualify for new lungs a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.  There were 1436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20 according to the United Network for Organ Sharing which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year of the total 2449 lung transplants performed CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients. A lung transplant is not a cure but it can extend a life if all goes well.Of those who received lung transplants (not just CFers) dating to 2000 an average of 84% survived after one year nearly 54% survived five years and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more according to the organ sharing network's data. Deciding to go for a lung transplant let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers) is no small matter. Claire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17 she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down her mom explained because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again at the very place she had returned to now when she was 19. While her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms she was being asked to contemplate her mortality. She prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did but her heart wasn't in it she said. She was still happy with what she had and as an adult able to make her own decisions.Her parents who split up when Claire was 3 struggled to make peace with her choice. "Just think of it as insurance even if you don't want to do it" her mother Melissa Nordquist Yeager pleaded at first. "Get on the list so you can change your mind."But ever since she'd been a small child Claire had a sense of self an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.Her dad John Wineland said Claire "has a relationship with her body that is sacred" and described his daughter's thinking: "This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with." And as her parent he said "I have to live with it."To see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind they were thrilled excited and terrified. "I was blown away so grateful happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up" remembered Yeager who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first. "I called her dad and we both just started crying" Yeager said."I'm just praying my ass off really that everything goes smoothly that she can get a shot at more time on the planet" Claire's dad said. "There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted."'Are you ready?'It's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.Fijolek who serves on the transplant team remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about "who are these [new] lungs going to live with" she said get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.Is Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?"How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?" Fijolek asked.Claire mentioned how her decline starting last fall threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days. Photos on a cell phone are passed around showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.Fijolek turned serious locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: "You know you need a transplant.""I was so young. I was so naïve" Claire answered describing where she was before. "All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed."Fijolek who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence pushed her further."Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time" she said. "Are you ready?"Claire assured her she is."It's a big change from where you were" the social worker said."I didn't want to waste anyone's time" Claire answered.Her mother sat by fanning herself with a medical brochure listened and wiped a tear from her eye.All she hadThe last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.Dr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood."Two days ago" she told him. "It's usually one or two times a month."He prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said "Your shoes will have to change."The doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed he explained.He asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats. Claire -- who used to do yoga six days a week loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had. For the first time that day her cheeks had color. "I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long" Afshar blurted out. Given her blood type and her condition he said she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.Claire's eyes opened wide and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly it seemed real."Three months!" Yeager said outside the center. "That made me want to throw up a little bit.""I'm a little overwhelmed" Claire said. "I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness."Hoping for a chanceThe truth is according to Claire not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well. She was able to "work with what I had in front of me" she said rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more. "If I had told myself things could be better than they are now I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives" she said. In changing her mind she said she had to swallow some of her pride and "open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried."A slew of tests still awaited Claire but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging. "For the first time ever I'm going there and it's really scary" she said. "Now that I actually want something better what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?"The pressure is on and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance. ,Health
 (CNN)In 2008 an Olympic year Lee Sweeney's phone was ringing nonstop. For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine that may be expected but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.The people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes. In the late 1990s Sweeney made headlines because of his research on "Schwarzenegger mice" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair. The main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.Word got out however that he was not interested.Ahead of this year's Commonwealth Games which started April 4 Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency."At the beginning when we first started publishing on this we did get contacted by high-level athletes" said Sweeney who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. "These days it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities."Back then gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.Responding promptly to the possibility in 2002 the anti-doping agency established "gene and cell-doping panels" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.In 2003 the organization banned "gene doping" which it defined as the "nontherapeutic use of cells genes genetic elements or modulation of gene expression having the capacity to enhance performance."This new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?Now almost 20 years later the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disorder hemophilia blindness cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles Sweeney said. "So because of that it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes."It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen" he said.Getting inside your genesIn the case of the "Schwarzenegger mice" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger. Genes are delivered into an organism using a "vector" the most common being viruses like that used by Sweeney which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and there unload the genetic material which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes. One example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin commonly known as EPO which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues. With the injection of external EPO elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.If extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery however it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.But the technology is not quite at that level yet."Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult" Sweeney said highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home. Another way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas9 a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing. The technique is rapidly developing leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its "gene-doping" ban to "gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression."The ban went into effect in January."There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9" Sweeney said. "One is to take cells from a person modify those cells and put them back into the person and that is probably the safest way to use it."The other way to use it which is to modify your existent DNA in the body is potentially very unsafe." Sweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases. In the case of gene-doping through gene therapies using vectors for delivery it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample such as blood said Olivier Rabin senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency. In particular Rabin said the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes he added."Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement he said.Rabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as "pretty good markers of gene manipulation" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.Asked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said "We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list."The question now is whether the first few cases have in fact happened without our knowledge.Modern occurrence "I never heard anything about it except for one time and it was around five years ago" said Sebastian Weber coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. "There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. AICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production. In cycling for gene doping to be effective techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen. "Just because you have more oxygen it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it" Weber said.As AICAR was a drug it wasn't gene doping but it led people to wonder about what was next he says after this "first step" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. "That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping."Tailoring to your genesThere are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance by understanding their physiology. For example project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot the RugbyGene Project are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed. "We recognize it is not only genetic" said Dr. Alun Williams an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. "Training diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor."The researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season give longer rest periods reduce the number of matches played in a season or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.But Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. "This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic like the tendon injury is still a small bit of a bigger picture" he said. "So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context." A different point of viewSome experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not."Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances" said bioethicist Andy Miah the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of "Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics Gene Doping and Sport." "Even if it's not a world record it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do and often that is about transcending boundaries."We give athletes all sort of technology to do that added Miah who readily claims to "disagree with anti-doping."Instead of the current scenario in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement. "If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised then I think that is a much more safe and healthy.Nick Busca is a triathlon coach personal trainer and CNN sport and health contributor.,Health
 (CNN)Two years ago Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. "She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a "breakthrough therapy" -- meaning that it demonstrated "substantial improvement" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Still to recommend approval the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review Dr. Paul Andreason warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes including death at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing he said had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. While Tyne had heard about these risks he said he "discounted death as a real statistical possibility" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  "I have two young children who love their grandmother" he told the committee. "If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving funny caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please I beg you do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love." 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective Andreason said in his medical review though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations according to the hearing transcript. "I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this I think they're probably willing to take that risk" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a "plea" to the FDA to "consider a large observational study so we can ensure that once it goes into real-world use that the benefits will outweigh the risks."   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. "She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release patients' family members doctors and other health care professionals started reporting "adverse events" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths life-threatening incidents falls insomnia nausea and fatigue. In more than 1000 reports patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.In November an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization the Institute for Safe Medication Practices warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was "not providing the expected benefit" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA these so-called "adverse event reports" document deaths side effects and other issues and can be made directly by consumers caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label for instance or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports "reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good." Thomas Moore senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit said the deaths are an "important warning signal" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June Nuplazid was the only medication listed as "suspect" in at least 500 of the death reports. Physicians medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks."This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported" said Diana Zuckerman founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research adding that because reports are voluntary potential problems may be underreported. "You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously."Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease according to the FDA and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death which it is required to pass along to the FDA."If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported especially in an older chronically ill patient population" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its "benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted for example that since the drug's approval two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. "I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug" Jankovic said in the statement. "While not all patients are completely satisfied many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations paranoia and other psychotic symptoms." In an interview this week FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product he said he is "familiar with the circumstances" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is "appropriately balancing" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard however and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  "You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's "complex safety profile" recognized at the time of its approval resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far according to the FDA typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    "Based on these data the FDA has at this time not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe "black box" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid the researchers interviewed by CNN said the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that because the drug was already approved these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning a nurse noted that the woman was "sleepy." Shortly after she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and less than an hour after the nurse's visit she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was "related" to Nuplazid her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away she said she was told by "someone at the hospital" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there "is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid." Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug along with Medicare claims data. However multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30000 a year for a single patient though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    The company meanwhile is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population concerned medical experts told CNN.    "You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. "If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    "That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk."    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   "This is exactly what I thought was going to happen" he said. "We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths."  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that after previous studies didn't show it was effective the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used "consistent appropriate and validated assessment methodology.""If patients know there is some level of benefit they can judge their risk" said Fox-Rawlings. "But if we don't even know that it does work how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope."    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  "I remember leaving really really frustrated" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the "staggering cost" of the medication she said she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories however and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   "Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    "If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror."

 (CNN)For the past 20 years Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely Kentucky just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap. If she's by herself she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3½-foot PVC pipe. The day CNN visited the temperature was just above freezing and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water. "This is what we go through to get water unfortunately" she said. Workman is not the only person in Martin County Kentucky or America for that matter who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint Michigan's lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria. As our water infrastructure system ages experts say keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.According to the the society about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age they can crack and water breaks become more common. In fact the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes. For many cash-strapped local utilities it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see. Faucets run brownBut when the problem does come to the surface it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes it smells like diesel fuel. Locals ask themselves "Just what's in the water?"Until several months ago customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer. Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame. 'We're just scared of the water'Martin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water. "We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years" she said. "You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. "I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better but I don't feel any better about it." Dr. Don Lafferty a local physician feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. "I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. "We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region." Where the War on Poverty beganNestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015 the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate. But poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty. "In 2018 in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine" said Gary Ball editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper The Mountain Citizen. What's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country said Lindell Ormsbee director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.  "I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine" Ormsbee said. What is happening? A large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county placed up and over rocky terrain making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet. When water systems are operating optimally there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes there is suddenly room for soil debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water. And because of the leakage issues the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. "As far as systematic lines it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished." Burns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine. But on top of issues with the lines there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities pumps and meters that still need to be made. Investments in hardware and software are neededFor a financially struggling municipality it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income. Infrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management. Small water systems such as Martin County that serve less than 10000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country. In addition to  infrastructure and financial challenges many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016. Some citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. "Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries" Lafferty said. "We are Americans too."Ball points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.  Some reliefRecently Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million. President Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years. Critics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector. "Time will tell" Lafferty said. "Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories."

 (CNN)They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity at least from outside appearances remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high. They are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs pay the bills and fool their families. For some addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.What addicts have in common according to experts is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill for example and never crave it again.This is a story about the others those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now experts explain can easily and lethally be derailed. Hanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who for the benefit of everyone's understanding want to be heard. After CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row the sorts we think of when we picture "heroin addict" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story. Being a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up. 'All smiles and happiness at work'Loving and successful parents good schools a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then at 15 he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery. "The feeling in my head was 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life' " Todd says. "It was the perfect drug for me."The 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26 he has gone stretches where he's been sober but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back. He's done heroin for periods of time and says it's "fantastic" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference assuming he can find them is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and if he can't get that Subutex. He makes good money which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit. He's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana. "I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1000" he says. "There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better." To avoid that hell Todd often lives a lie. He's "all smiles and happiness at work" he says and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off. But death is very much a reality in his life.His last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction. He'd like to find love build a relationship and have a family but says "It would be dishonest and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem."He knows that he has a lot to live for but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely. "I've always wanted to see the world" he says. "I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison." The sign of an addictThe sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life was the giveaway. He like 10% or 15% of people has the disease of addiction explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. What offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem says Gitlow is that "you don't know in advance what person you're going to be."Todd may be functioning now but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?"They all start out functioning" he says. "The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying." What Todd needs Gitlow says is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority or 80% of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well he says.Not a unique storyIt didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12 when she began cutting herself. Carving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain giving her a high she says. The first time she did it she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.Now at 23 Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used "I hurt myself a lot less." The difference now is that she like Todd no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning she insists "I just do enough to stay well" through the day and not feel physical pain. She works hard always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school where she was dubbed "gifted and talented" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.How she found heroin she says is not unique. Long plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief as did deep-tissue massage. Finally four years ago a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills. She found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions she says effectively ending her lawful pain management. Once her pills ran out she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find though and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend a heroin user suggested that she give his drug a try."I can't find pills I'm in pain and it's really cheap" she remembers telling herself. "What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people."Where she lives in Texas near the Mexican border the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50 but she can get half a gram of heroin which is far more potent for $20. The same product she says would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country. "If I moved somewhere where it was $100" she says "I'd quit."Her husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan the overdose antidote drug in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses."He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me" Lisa says. "That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end." Lisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else her family included believes she's hooked on "just pills." It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment."People drink and we think nothing of it. You do heroin and you're the scum of the earth" she says. "People will cut you out of their lives." Everybody's problemHeroin users weren't always "the scum of the earth." In the late 19th century it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer. Today there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't and much of that is rooted in racism says Dr. Michael Miller who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. White socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it he says but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it the perception changed and stuck.Now with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative it's become everybody's problem -- white or black rich or poor on the coasts or in middle America no matter whether you live in a city suburb or rural community. That's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret. She admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then? "She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge" Gitlow says. "What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead."  'Like downing a beer'Not everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew. For as long as Matthew can remember he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD he says. An arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew 28 first tried oxycodone. Later a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain a condition he's had for six years. It's the sort of pain he says that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.Raised in the Eastern US he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications. It's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse. He's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take. "It's similar to a dose of Percocet." he says. "The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail." He doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out."I just don't find sober me is the best me" he says. Having a secret can be isolating he says but otherwise heroin has not hindered his life. Rather Matthew says "It's changed my life for the better." Not only does it help with the pain he says it constipates him allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.  "I'm dependent" he says. "But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict."  The crippling truthMatthew is kidding himself experts say."Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease" Gitlow said. "Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component." Starting at 19 the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than "conventional coping mechanisms" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.Matthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem Gitlow says is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.  Plus using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry says Siobhan Morse director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network. The natural way a body manages pain or stress Morse says is by producing endorphins."If you're giving it the artificial substance" she explains the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. "So when you take away the artificial substance everything is so painful." And for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse Morse adds. She describes the combination as a "moving target."Eventually she and other experts say Matthew's drug use will catch up with him."I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict" Morse says. The fall of 'Superwoman'Rebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.She grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled."I didn't have any boundaries" says Rebecca 59. "I could do whatever I wanted which was a recipe for disaster."Starting at 12 she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15 the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin. "I was in love" she says of the drug. "It became the love of my life."One day she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks. "Mom didn't bat an eye" Rebecca remembers. Instead she shrugged it off saying "Jewish people aren't addicts." Her father when he was around was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes she says. Rebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.Divorced and 24 Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help. Along the way she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose. Rebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart so did she. "That was when I started to spiral down" Rebecca says. "As soon as I started using it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using."Even as Rebecca returned to heroin spending $100 or more a day she built a career in corporate travel working for big-name companies."As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick I was like Superwoman" she says of her job performance. "If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict people would have laughed." Years of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30000 mistake at work got her fired."People kept saying 'You're going to die' " Rebecca says. "The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die it's that I was going to live." Her kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the "nasty places" she called home. "It was just awful" says Rebecca who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed. Today Rebecca is three years sober. The last time she entered treatment she says "something clicked and I remember thinking 'I can't do this anymore.' "She was "sick and tired of being sick and tired" she says. "I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high." Rebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic another is also a heroin addict and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills. "It's in the genes" Rebecca says. "No doubt."She has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community. "If there's any regret it's that I've missed decades" Rebecca says. "I just thought I wasn't going to live so I never worried about getting old."  She is fighting to make the rest of her life matter all the while knowing -- based on decades of experience -- how easily she could slip again. One lapse one moment of weakness or overconfidence that she can handle it and everything Rebecca is building up could come crashing down and quite possibly bury her.,Health
 (CNN)As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes the more money he or she makes.  In 2014 and 2015 opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25000 during that time.Physicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid. "This is the first time we've seen this and it's really important" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative. "It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics and that's very disturbing" said Kolodny who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers. "I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money but in either case it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value" said Dr. Michael Barnett assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. CNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives. Carey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids it must be because they were the best option for her pain. Then she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years. "Once I found out he was being paid I thought 'was it really in my best interest or was it in his best interest?' " she said. To do the analysis CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients. The CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015 during which time more than 811000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.  Fifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.Doctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money. Among doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.On average doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1% on average received nine times more money than the typical doctor. "The correlation you found is very powerful" said David Rothman director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. "What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more." Paying doctors for speaking consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications but it has long been a controversial practice.   Pharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment.  It's illegal however for doctors to prescribe the drug in exchange for kickback payments from a manufacturer.  Dr. Steven Stanos president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.  "They know those medicines and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding" Stanos said adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new "abuse-deterrent" opioid drugs.  Stanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017 according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  Stanos said the money was used for various projects including courses on safe opioid prescribing.  "I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient" he said. But Dr. Daniel Carlat former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits. "It's not proof positive but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care" said Carlat a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. "It makes me extremely concerned." Barnett one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.  "It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether" he said. "They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective."  According to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.  "PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing" according to the statement from the group. 'I trusted my doctor' Angela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment. She says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah a pain specialist in Greenville South Carolina prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2½ years from March 2013 through July 2015.  Subsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "He said it would do wonders for me and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth" Cantone said. She says Subsys helped her pain but it left her in "a zombie-like" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children two of whom have autism and other special needs.  "I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn" she said. She says that if she missed even one day of the drug she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.  She said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.  "I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out" she said.  She says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication he became belligerent. "He said it was Subsys or nothing" she said. Cantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016 the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200000 according to Open Payments the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors. CNN compared the $190000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.Nearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking training education and consulting. Cantone is now suing Thiyagarajah accusing him of setting out to "defraud and deceive" her for "the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions sales and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits." Through his attorney Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation. In a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was "reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care." His attorney E. Brown Parkinson said the doctor is currently practicing medicine alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York. Thiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.  But he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.  In 2014 and 2015 physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah however annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.After about two years on Subsys Cantone says she took herself off the drug cold turkey. According to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid buprenorphine "for non-legitimate medical need" in violation of federal law. In March 2016 the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys. The DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services according to Robert Murphy associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.  Cantone is also suing Insys the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.  Separate from Cantone's lawsuit John Kapoor the founder and largest shareholder of Insys was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug. "Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms" said Tom Becker a spokesman for Kapoor. "He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court."  Kapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October according to a company news release.  Several other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.  Separately Sen. Claire McCaskill a Democrat from Missouri is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry. According to her investigation and the federal indictment Insys used a combination of tactics such as falsifying medical records misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.  Saeed Motahari president and CEO of Insys wrote a letter in September to McCaskill noting that he was "concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees." He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.  "I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country" Motahari added.  The analysis Sometimes pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.  Among the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category which includes speaking fees consulting travel and food. Concerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.  Several studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits. For example researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients. "This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer" the authors concluded. Some studies have looked at whether the amount of money a doctor receives makes a difference. Studies by researchers at Yale University the George Washington University Milken Institute of Public Health and Harvard Medical School have all found that the more money physicians are paid by pharmaceutical companies the more likely they are to prescribe certain drugs. Dr. Patrice Harris a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association said that the CNN and Harvard data raised "fair questions" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other. It's "not a cause and effect relationship" said Harris chairwoman of the association's opioid task force adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions. "[We] strongly oppose inappropriate unethical interactions between physicians and industry" she added. "But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate."   Harris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they "can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients."  Stanos the pain physician said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient. "I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit" he said. But Jena one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.  "Every decision every recommendation a physician makes should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor" said Jena associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.  "If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred  how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?" he asked.  From 1999 to 2015 more than 183000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids according to the CDC. In October President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency. At least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.  Purdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla another opioid in November according to company spokesman Robert Josephson."We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers" a company statement said.  More than $1 million in three years Though Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs. Several patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers. From August 2013 through December 2016 Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park Kansas was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers according to the federal Open Payments database. Most of the payments were fees for speaking training and education. Ballou one of his patients says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors. "He said he was going to Miami and they were going to give him a convertible and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had" said Ballou who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.  Simon's lawyer James Wyrsch said he would not comment on pending litigation.  In court documents he asked for the case to be dismissed saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were "simply incorrect."  Bridget Patton a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office said federal agents went to the office where Simon works Mid-America PolyClinic in July. The clinic said in a statement that it is "fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24. "We had a lawful presence at that facility" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit. The owner of the pain clinic Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions. Simon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation. Ballou said that when she was Simon's patient it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs. But now she looks back with anger. Cantone the patient who went to Thiyagarajah the pain specialist in South Carolina looks back with sadness.  She cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.  Her card said her mother liked to sleep.  "Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park' it was the years of her finding me on the floor" Cantone said. "I feel like I failed as a parent." She becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.  "The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit not my own" she said.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.

 (CNN)California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna."If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law" he said.Aetna the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers told CNN it looked forward to "explaining our clinical review process" to the commissioner.The California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015 according to the insurer. During the deposition the doctor said he was following Aetna's training in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him. Jones said his expectation would be "that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests" and that it's troubling that "during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna he never once looked at patients' medical records himself." "It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician as opposed to some other licensed professional" Jones told CNN. "That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation."The insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office.Members of the medical community expressed similar shock saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country."Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors."This is potentially a huge huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions" said Dr. Andrew Murphy who like Irani is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.The Gillen Washington caseThe deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court. Gillen Washington 23 is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's "reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him."Aetna has rejected the allegations saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency or CVID in high school became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser. Aetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion which can cost up to $20000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.Despite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.Once his blood was tested Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that according to Aetna Washington continued to miss infusions.Washington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary "to prevent acute and long-term problems.""Aetna is blaming me for what happened" Washington told CNN. "I'll just be honest it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change."During his videotaped deposition in October 2016 Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.Questioned about Washington's condition Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.Iinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient."Do I know what happens?" the doctor said. "Again I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it."Iinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off "pertinent information" provided to him by a nurse."Did you ever look at medical records?" Scott Glovsky Washington's attorney asked Iinuma in the deposition."No I did not" the doctor says shaking his head."So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?" Glovsky asks."Correct."Iinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while he said he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.How many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?"Zero to one" he said.Glovsky told CNN he had "never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors."Aetna's responseAetna defended Iinuma who is no longer with the company saying in its legal brief that he relied on his "years of experience" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately."Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct" Aetna said in court papers. "Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts." In its trial brief Aetna said: "Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations."In addition to applying their clinical judgment the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated and are publicly available for any treating physician to review."Jones the California insurance commissioner said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records."What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director he wasn't actually reviewing medical records" Jones told CNN.He said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine "whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician."If the probe determines that violations occurred he said California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.CNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson an attorney representing Aetna declined to answer any questions. Asked about the California investigation Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:"We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process."Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process medical directors are provided all submitted medical records and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.  "Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process."'A huge admission'Dr. Arthur Caplan founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center described Iinuma's testimony as "a huge admission of fundamental immorality.""People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients" Caplan said adding the testimony shows there "needs to be more transparency and accountability" from private for-profit insurers in making these decisions.Murphy the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member said he was "shocked" and "flabbergasted" by the medical director's admission. "This is something that all of us have long suspected but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records that's not good" said Murphy who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia."If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah you'd have to question every single case he reviewed." Murphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.  "We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements" he said."Dealing with these denials is very time consuming. A great deal of nursing time is spent filling and refilling out paperwork trying to get the patient treatment."If that does not work then physicians need to get involved and demand medical director involvement which may or may not occur in a timely fashion -- or sometimes not at all" he said. "It's very frustrating.",Health
 (CNN)Two years ago Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. "She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a "breakthrough therapy" -- meaning that it demonstrated "substantial improvement" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Still to recommend approval the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review Dr. Paul Andreason warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes including death at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing he said had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. While Tyne had heard about these risks he said he "discounted death as a real statistical possibility" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  "I have two young children who love their grandmother" he told the committee. "If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving funny caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please I beg you do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love." 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective Andreason said in his medical review though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations according to the hearing transcript. "I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this I think they're probably willing to take that risk" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a "plea" to the FDA to "consider a large observational study so we can ensure that once it goes into real-world use that the benefits will outweigh the risks."   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. "She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release patients' family members doctors and other health care professionals started reporting "adverse events" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths life-threatening incidents falls insomnia nausea and fatigue. In more than 1000 reports patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.In November an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization the Institute for Safe Medication Practices warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was "not providing the expected benefit" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA these so-called "adverse event reports" document deaths side effects and other issues and can be made directly by consumers caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label for instance or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports "reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good." Thomas Moore senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit said the deaths are an "important warning signal" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June Nuplazid was the only medication listed as "suspect" in at least 500 of the death reports. Physicians medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks."This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported" said Diana Zuckerman founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research adding that because reports are voluntary potential problems may be underreported. "You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously."Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease according to the FDA and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death which it is required to pass along to the FDA."If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported especially in an older chronically ill patient population" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its "benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted for example that since the drug's approval two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. "I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug" Jankovic said in the statement. "While not all patients are completely satisfied many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations paranoia and other psychotic symptoms." In an interview this week FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product he said he is "familiar with the circumstances" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is "appropriately balancing" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard however and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  "You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's "complex safety profile" recognized at the time of its approval resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far according to the FDA typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    "Based on these data the FDA has at this time not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe "black box" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid the researchers interviewed by CNN said the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that because the drug was already approved these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning a nurse noted that the woman was "sleepy." Shortly after she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and less than an hour after the nurse's visit she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was "related" to Nuplazid her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away she said she was told by "someone at the hospital" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there "is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid." Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug along with Medicare claims data. However multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30000 a year for a single patient though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    The company meanwhile is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population concerned medical experts told CNN.    "You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. "If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    "That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk."    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   "This is exactly what I thought was going to happen" he said. "We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths."  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that after previous studies didn't show it was effective the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used "consistent appropriate and validated assessment methodology.""If patients know there is some level of benefit they can judge their risk" said Fox-Rawlings. "But if we don't even know that it does work how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope."    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  "I remember leaving really really frustrated" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the "staggering cost" of the medication she said she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories however and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   "Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    "If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror."

 (CNN)Thanksgiving is upon us which means in just a couple of months it will be time to deflate from holiday calorie overload.  But before you feast consider this:  Though excess calories consumed during meals can certainly contribute to a "bloated" or full feeling along with weight gain there are many other possible reasons why you may feel like you've gone up a jeans size after eating.  For these causes of bloating the popular advice you might find on a Google search isn't likely to help.  "We're using the same word to refer to 50 different things and so you have no idea if what you read online is referring to the same type of bloating you are experiencing" said Tamara Duker Freuman a registered dietitian who specializes in digestive disorders and author of the forthcoming book "The Bloated Belly Whisperer."Below are some myths debunked to give you a better sense of what bloating really is what it isn't and what you can do about it.  Myth 1:  All bloating has a common cause.Feeling "overly full" or experiencing discomfort after eating or having a stomach that is noticeably distended might seem like similar bloating symptoms but that doesn't mean the cause is the same for each.  "People most often come in saying they are 'bloated' but what they mean by that is quite varied and I usually need to do quite a bit of digging to really understand what it means to them.  It is a very subjective sensation" said Dr. Yevgenia Pashinsky a gastroenterologist and clinical instructor of medicine and gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.  Often people will come in with a self-diagnosis "which often has little to do with the actual causes of their symptoms" Pashinsky added.  Technically anything you put in your GI tract has the potential to cause bloating.  But according to Pashinsky some people are more susceptible to bloating than others including those with conditions such as gastroparesis (when the stomach is slow to empty) functional dyspepsia (an inability of the stomach wall to relax and accommodate food) and a condition known as SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (in which excess bacteria live in a part of the intestinal tract where they don't belong).  Additionally one might feel overly full or distended because there's too much gas in their gastrointestinal tract because they are constipated or because they have aerophagia or excessive air swallowing. Identifying the cause of bloating matters because the treatment that offers relief will vary from person to person and is therefore not a "one size fits all" solution.Myth 2:  You don't need a doctor or dietitian to help.Meeting with a gastroenterologist and a registered dietitian can help you get the most accurate diagnosis for your bloating along with a tailored treatment plan.  What's more it can help you avoid nutritional deficiencies and rule out more serious problems.  "Though bloating can represent something as simple as lactose intolerance or mild constipation it can be something as serious as a malignancy whether gastrointestinal or gynecological in nature.  And you're not going to know that by going online" Pashinsky said.  "I strongly feel that everyone should have a dietary assessment as part of their overall health care whether they are symptomatic or not" she added. "Dietary causes are the most common contributors to gastrointestinal symptoms and with the overwhelming amount of information available people get caught up in restrictions that can diminish quality of life and lead to nutritional insufficiencies."For example self-diagnosis and treatment might lead someone to eliminate all vegetables which can adversely affect intake of the essential nutrient folate when in reality only a handful of veggies with specific types of fiber trigger their symptoms Freuman explained.  Additionally people often eliminate all calcium-rich dairy foods when only dairy foods high in the milk sugar lactose actually bother them.  In this case a lactose-free milk for example would help ensure adequate intake of calcium.Myth 3:  Sodium causes 'bloating.' "Excess sodium can cause fluid retention [not bloating per se] and can give a 'puffy' appearance but more so in the face and extremities than in the abdomen" Freuman said.  Bloating in the gastrointestinal world generally refers to abdominal swelling that is related to either gas food or stool excess in the intestinal system or the sensation of this Pashinsky explained.  "It's that feeling of over-fullness and discomfort in the digestive tract or it's a visible distention of your abdomen which increases the size of your stomach" Freuman added.    On the flip side fluid retention is related to sodium and water balance and involves the kidneys and blood vessels.  "It can lead to excessive soft tissue swelling which can cause swollen ankles or indentation from socks but this is not something that is primarily gastrointestinal in nature" Pashinsky said.Though it's true that eating a low-salt diet and drinking more water may help resolve fluid retention if your kidneys are working properly this will do nothing for you if you are clinically bloated Freuman explained.  Being precise with your terminology and giving examples of both alleviating an aggravating factors for symptoms and how these relate to eating and bowel function are important when talking with your doctor as that will help determine next steps in testing and potential treatment options Pashinksy said.Freuman added that "If you use the term 'bloating' your doctor might think you are suffering from acid reflux or constipation.  But if you are actually retaining water this might imply blood pressure issues or kidney issues or fluid retention in which case you might need a low-sodium diet increased intake of potassium or a diuretic."Put another way: If you are truly bloated from an underlying digestive issue and you read an article that says "cut back on sodium" that won't be helpful. "There's a smattering of random advice that's not particularly tailored to people and may not be useful because you may not be talking about the same problem" Freuman said.  Myth#4:  Bloating is caused by a bacterial imbalance.Our gastrointestinal tracts are home to trillions of bacteria which you can think of in three ways. The first is probiotic or beneficial bacteria which may make vitamins and short-chain fatty acids that are good for us Freuman explained.  The second group of bacteria are called commensals and they seem to neither help nor hurt us. The third is a group that is potentially pathogenic or harmful like if a particular strain of E. coli is allowed to grow unchecked. All of us host bacteria from these three categories.  "But there's this popular idea that if you feel bloated or have a lot of gas that you are over-represented by the 'bad' disease-causing bacteria and have too little of the 'good' bacteria ... and that there is some sort of imbalance causing you to have excess gas or discomfort or constipation" Freuman said.  "This is an incredible oversimplification and not necessarily true."What this means is that the notion of adding more "good" bacteria in the form of a probiotic won't help your symptoms.  In fact some find that a probiotic makes them more bloated not less Freuman said.   That's because "good" bacteria can ferment nutrients just as much as the "bad" bacteria -- which means the "good guys" can produce plenty of gas in the GI tract.Pashinsky added "I do not routinely recommend a probiotic for bloating because I feel our knowledge of the microbiome at this point is barely scratching the surface and it will be a few years before we really have an decent understanding on how to manipulate it."Myth 5:  Certain foods can eliminate bloating.Despite what you may find on an Internet search there are no magic foods that will help alleviate bloating.  "Overall meal patterns and dietary patterns that address the specific cause of your bloating can help reduce the symptoms but there's nothing magic about say asparagus that will cure a truly bloated belly" Freuman said.In fact adding foods can make your bloating worse not better.  "If you are full of gas and you eat asparagus or celery you might assume the gas will go away but this is not necessarily the case" Freuman added.  "Some people find asparagus or celery gassy in and of itself."Keeping a food and symptom journal can help you determine whether there is something about your diet that is contributing to your symptoms.   "It's best to look at an overall pattern to see what can be contributing to the bloating rather than seeking out salvation in some random superfood" Freuman said.Myth 6:  Bloating is belly fat.Bloating isn't belly fat.  Belly fat is belly fat.  "People will say 'I'm bloated' but what they really mean is that they have gained belly fat" Freuman said.  Gaining weight around your abdomen is common in women during menopause.  "Someone might say 'I feel like I have a spare tire around my middle and my clothes fit differently' and they call it bloating but I realize they are really talking about belly fat and weight gain and the solution to that is weight loss" Freuman said.  A calorie-restricted diet rich in protein and fiber along with increased amounts of exercise can help.  Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. ,Health
 (CNN)Thanksgiving is a time for feasting certainly not fasting or dieting.  But if you're kicking off the holiday season with your health in mind there are a few smart switches you can make on Turkey Day that will help boost your nutrition and lighten your calorie load.   Below are some savvy substitutions that can help you save nearly 1200 calories for the entire meal.Red wine instead of White Russian Calories in cocktails can add up quickly thanks to sugary mixers tonic juice soda and syrups.  What's more depending on the pour mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol (that is more than 1.5 ounces of vodka or gin) which also boosts calories.   An 8-ounce White Russian can top 500 calories thanks to Kahlúa vodka and heavy cream but a 5-ounce glass of red wine has about 125 calories or about a quarter of the amount.  If you prefer the higher-calorie cocktails limit yourself to one.Carrots and hummus instead of cheese and crackers A couple of multigrain crackers with cheddar cheese has 134 calories -- not calorie overload but compare that with two baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus which has only 62 calories plus 2 grams of fiber. You can have double the portion for fewer calories if you choose crudité over cheese.  If you prefer dips to hummus try substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream to shave calories and boost protein. Dark-meat turkey without skin instead of with skin Truth be told dark-meat turkey is delicious and is typically juicier and more flavorful than white meat. Plus dark meat delivers more zinc and iron than white meat.  There's no need to forgo dark meat this Thanksgiving. But skip the skin to save some calories and saturated fat. Dark meat with skin is 175 calories per 3-ounce serving and without skin is 147 calories. For portion control keep your serving to 3 ounces which is similar in size to a deck of cards or a computer mouse.  Vegan mushroom gravy instead of traditional gravyTurkey may not seem like "turkey" without gravy as the sauce gives a flavor upgrade to any dish. But making your gravy with mushrooms instead of meat drippings. can give your bird a savory "umami" flavor while saving a significant amount of calories and fat. Traditional gravy is 63 calories per quarter-cup and vegan mushroom gravy is only 35 calories. And here's another bonus to mushroom gravy: Because it is meatless it's suitable for vegan guests.  Whatever gravy you choose try using a tablespoon when serving yourself instead of pouring from a gravy boat to help control your portion size.Whole-grain stuffing with kale instead of traditional stuffing Stuffing is delicious but using white bread as an ingredient is a missed nutritional opportunity as it doesn't offer the fiber and vitamins that whole-grain bread does.  Try a stuffing made with whole wheat bread oats or quinoa to boost the nutrients.  The New York Times' whole-grain stuffing with kale figs dates and hazelnuts has 7 grams of fiber and about 60 fewer calories per serving than a traditional stuffing. Traditional stuffing is about 420 calories per cup while whole-grain stuffing with kale and dried fruit is 357 calories.Baked sweet potato instead of sweet potato casserole with marshmallowsSweet potatoes are nutritious and delicious and can help you achieve smooth glowing skin as they are loaded with vitamin A.  However when you add brown sugar butter and marshmallows you're pretty much eating dessert.  One serving of candied sweet potato casserole with marshmallows packs 405 calories 19 grams of fat and 32 grams of sugar.   A whole baked sweet potato has only 130 calories and only 9 grams of natural sugar.  You can even add some toasted marshmallows for an extra 30 calories.Low-fat green bean casserole instead of traditional green bean casserole Traditional green bean casserole is a Thanksgiving staple that is about 24 calories per cup but the healthier eatingwell.com version with breadcrumbs instead of French fried onions has only 188 calories per cup.  If you like the traditional green bean casserole recipe you can use fresher lower-fat ingredients that will improve the healthfulness of the dish and the flavor.  Simply substitute the French fried onions with fresh onions (you can bake them after soaking them in buttermilk and coating with breadcrumbs and flour) and use low-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular version.  You can also substitute low-fat milk (like 1%) for whole milk which saves calories and saturated fat.    Pumpkin pie instead of pecan pieThere's no need to skip dessert but by choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie you can save over 200 calories. Pecan pie is about 541 calories per slice and pumpkin is 323 calories. Apple pie is another lower-calorie choice compared with pecan at 363 calories per slice.  If you can't resist pecan pie (and who could blame you) take a thin slice or go crustless and eat only the filling.  And hold off on the whipped cream!Make all these substitutes and your total calorie savings is 1179. Hopefully you won't miss anything from your 2546-calorie traditional feast as you enjoy a traditional simple delicious 1367-calorie Thanksgiving dinner.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. ,Health
 (CNN)I often tell people to steer clear of alcoholic beverages when trying to lose weight. After all they don't exactly provide nutritious calories and consuming them can make it increasingly more challenging to lose weight.  But that doesn't stop people from asking me "what is the best drink to have on a diet?"   Clearly some alcoholic beverages are more waistline-friendly than others. So the short answer is: If you're looking to shed pounds some of your lowest-calorie bets are a shot of spirits (for example a 1.5-ounce shot of vodka gin rum whiskey or tequila contains an average of 97 calories) a glass of champagne (about 84 calories per 4 ounces); a glass of dry wine (approximately 120 to 125 calories per 5 ounces) or a traditional martini with an average of 124 calories for a 2.5-ounce serving.  A light beer (approximately 100 calories) or a glass of reduced-calorie wine (about 90 to 100 calories) are other lower-calorie options.But if you want to know why some alcoholic beverages contain more calories than others read on.Pure alcohol contains 7 calories per gram -- that's less than a gram of fat which has 9 calories but more than protein and carbs which have 4 calories per gram each -- but other variables of your drink influence the calorie count. The amount of alcohol the total volume of a beverage the amount of carbohydrates and sugars and mixers all play a role.Generally speaking the biggest difference in calories in beverages comes from the alcohol content but the presence of carbohydrates in alcoholic beverages also contributes largely to its calories according to Dwayne Bershaw who teaches winemaking classes in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University.  Any carbohydrates in wine consist of small amounts of sugar which may either be left over from the original grape sugar after most of it ferments into alcohol or added from grape juice or some other source in order to balance the acidity of the wine.  Unless we're talking about a dessert wine this amount of sugar is generally small and does not contribute a significant amount of calories to wine.Beer is made from grain which stores carbohydrates in the form of starch -- specifically large branched sugar molecules which are chopped into pieces by naturally occurring enzymes in malted barley during the brewing process. The smallest sugar pieces are converted to alcohol by yeast but some larger pieces remain that cannot be broken down by yeast according to Bershaw. These remaining carbohydrates contribute to the overall calorie count for most beers.Generally beer has more calories than wine but the calorie difference in the two primarily comes from the leftover carbohydrates in beer as the sugar content for most wines is fairly low.Low-calorie beers have an additional enzyme added during the brewing or fermentation process and it breaks down all of the starch molecules into simple sugars so there are no remaining carbohydrates. These beers also have a relatively low alcohol content to keep the total calorie count quite low according to Bershaw.And generally spirits -- including vodka tequila rum and gin  -- do not contain any carbohydrates or sugars. Some producers may add small amounts of sugar to combat any perceived bitterness according to Bershaw but like wine this small amount would not bump the calorie count much. Though they have higher alcohol by volume (up to 40% or more) the volume of a standard shot is small (1.5 ounces) making them a relatively lower-calorie option -- that is as long as you can stick to one shot or mix it with a zero-calorie beverage like a diet cola soda water or seltzer.Other ingredients -- including mixers tonic water juice soda syrups cream and coconut -- all pack sugar and fat calories on top of alcohol and should be consumed with caution explained Ginger Hultin a registered dietitian spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and author of the blog ChampagneNutrition.  "Margaritas and pina coladas can have close to 500 calories per drink depending on the size and how it's made and could be a real challenge for anyone with a weight loss goal" Hultin added.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. ,Health
 (CNN)You're out late at night and you've had one too many drinks. You're feeling a bit inebriated and you're wondering if a cup of coffee can help. Many of us have been there.Well here's the lowdown: While a cup of joe or shot of espresso can help to perk you up it's not going to help sober you up. In fact in some situations the combination of caffeine and alcohol could be potentially harmful. "I call it the 'perfect storm' " said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien senior associate dean for health care education at the Wake Forest School of Medicine who has researched the interactions between caffeine and alcohol including its effects on injury risk. How alcohol and caffeine are metabolized Caffeine is a stimulant so it can make you more alert and possibly improve your performance to some extent according to Dr. Robert Swift associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addition Studies. Specifically caffeine interferes with the action of a chemical known as adenosine. "Adenosine tends to be sedative ... and one of the signals to fall asleep is that adenosine builds up in the brain" Swift said. By blocking the action of adenosine caffeine has the ability to make you feel less tired Swift explained. Interestingly alcohol can trigger the release of dopamine which results in a stimulant effect when you first start drinking though this does not necessarily mean you are any less impaired from alcohol according to Swift.Alcohol's sedative effects tend to kick in after blood alcohol levels peak and then start to fall. Specifically alcohol promotes the release of the brain chemical GABA which produces sedation Swift explained. Alcohol also blocks the action of glutamate a brain chemical that stimulates nerve cells and this blockade can also produce sedation. During this time you might feel tired and in need of a pick-me-up. Alcohol and caffeine: A potentially dangerous combinationConsuming caffeine might make you feel less sleepy when drinking alcohol but it will not accelerate alcohol metabolism or ameliorate its effects experts say. Mixing the two is also a practice that the US Dietary Guidelines cautions against. A major concern when seeking out coffee or any source of caffeine in an effort to feel awake after a few drinks is that by making you feel less tired you may think you are less inebriated than you actually are. "Even if someone feels like the caffeine causes them to feel more awake and less sluggish they still need to be aware that the alcohol is still metabolizing in the same way and on the same timeframe as if they haven't had any caffeine ... which means that its effects can still be potentially dangerous" said Melissa Majumdar a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."Someone may think 'I can drive now' ... they see a car stop suddenly and they have to put their foot on the brake quickly but reaction time could be slow" Swift said. "What you feel is [linked to] a different part of your brain that is the motor system that controls reaction time.""Your blood alcohol concentration won't be reversed by caffeine" Swift added. That means people feel less tired from alcohol when they drink coffee "but they are not any less impaired" Swift explained.In one study involving close to 130 adult drinkers alcohol negatively affected reaction time and resulted in more crashes during a simulated driving test but drinking caffeinated beer didn't improve people's ability to drive. In addition to the fact that consuming caffeine while drinking won't make you any sharper behind the wheel there also is no evidence that consuming caffeine while drinking would improve your judgment in social situations according to Swift. What's more by making you feel less tired or sedated you may be inclined to consume more alcohol than you otherwise would. "If you take caffeine with your alcohol people drink more" Swift said. "The usual signal where people would say 'I've had enough' is no longer there.""Caffeine permits you to stay awake longer than you would have otherwise -- and therefore drink for a longer amount of time" O'Brien added. "I had the experience of taking care of a young man who was extremely intoxicated and almost on a ventilator ... he said had been drinking Red Bull and Jägermeister. When I asked why he was mixing alcohol and caffeine he said 'So I can stay drunk longer' " O'Brien said.The marketing and sale of premixed beverages containing alcohol and caffeine has been particularly concerning among experts. But there has been a positive outcome: O'Brien's research examining injury associated with these caffeinated malt beverages (dubbed "AEDs or "alcoholic energy drinks") contributed to the successful removal of these beverages from the market in 2010. "The FDA put the kibosh on that because of the negative public health implications" Swift said. Strategies for sobering upExperts say the only way to sober up is to let time pass. The specific time it will take for alcohol to leave your system depends on the individual but on average people metabolize about one drink per hour. "If you've had five drinks it would take about five hours to get the alcohol totally out of your system" Swift said.But an even better strategy is to prevent intoxication in the first place. Experts say drinking with food in your stomach can slow the rise of alcohol in your bloodstream which can make you less impaired than if you drank on an empty stomach. Alternating alcoholic beverages with seltzer or water is another helpful strategy. It won't slow the absorption of alcohol in the body or make you less inebriated but "water will help keep one hydrated ... and can potentially decrease the amount of alcohol someone drinks" Majumdar said.

 (CNN)Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease a study of more than 400000 adults in China suggests.  Daily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease which manifests as heart attacks and strokes compared with adults who avoided eggs according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.Commonly called heart disease cardiovascular disease includes heart failure arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure carrying too much weight or obesity and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease which is triggered by unhealthy diet physical inactivity smoking and harmful use of alcohol.'Controversial' nutrition sourceIn the past doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs. Though eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components they also have high amounts of cholesterol which was thought might be harmful explained Canqing Yu a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.  Yet "existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population "which have huge differences in dietary habits lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns" Yu said.These are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease. To begin they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer cardiovascular disease or diabetes.Slightly more than 13% of these adults ranging in age from 30 to 79 said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken not duck eggs Yu noted.Over nearly nine years the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events such as heart attacks and strokes including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due usually to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked usually by a blood clot.  "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China which accounted for half of the total mortality" Yu said. "Stroke including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is the first cause of premature death followed by ischemic heart disease."During follow-up 9985 people died of cardiovascular disease and an additional 5103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.Analyzing the data the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.In fact participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries.  Additionally the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.Finally egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.  Based on the results Yu said eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more the new research is "by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect" he said.On the downside the research team collected only "crude information" about egg consumption from participants and this prevented them from estimating effects "more precisely" Yu said. "We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China."Part of a healthy dietCaroline Richard an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease. "Saying that this is a very large study and that in itself is a strength and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors" said Richard who was not involved in the research. Her own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors including higher rates of blood sugar inflammation and cholesterol.  "Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol" or "good" cholesterol she added. The new study then "delivers a similar message" that "egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease" Richard said. Some studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes she said. "In this study however they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it" Richard said. Still she noted "this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China."Cardiovascular disease which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Cardiovascular disease causes nearly a third -- 31% -- of all global deaths each year. "Overall I would say that consuming egg as part of a healthy diet does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and we now have another carefully done study to support that" Richard said.,Health
 (CNN)Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.After just one year on a reduced-calorie diet study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress a process that has been tied to diabetes cancer Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.The study was published Thursday in the journal Cell Metabolism. "Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status" said Leanne M. Redman lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. Animal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?Aging biomarkersDuring the first phase teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction others tested exercise only and still others tested half-diet half-exercise.Another question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?Aging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy Redman said. "We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them" she said. After the pilot studies the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston. At Pennington Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study participants ate what they liked yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were "nutritionally adequate" Redman said.Each participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25% weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time. However the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated Redman said: "People achieved 15% calorie restriction actual over the two years." No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were "pretty remarkable" she said. For example participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.  "The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%" Redman said. This remained true after one year when weight loss peaked and after two years when weight remained constant. A slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy. "It's important because every time we generate energy in the body we generate byproducts" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism also called oxygen radicals accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs she explained. And this damage is "what has been linked to a shortened lifespan" she said.Not only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction then mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals Redman said.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Commit to your diet with this subscription meal kit'Breakthrough'The "big breakthrough" with this study said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.  Randomized controlled trials in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis. "It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents" Speakman said. Since then studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. "For example it doesn't work in houseflies" he said. "Plus the monkey literature is a bit confusing."For this reason the new study's "big contribution" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species Speakman said.That said the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was "rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals" he said. "This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans." However a strength of the new research is that it "included extensive measurements of the individual responses."Exactly how calorie restriction prevents aging Speakman said "is the million-dollar question." The research supports two theories of longer life: the "rate of living" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage. However the study shows a correlation only he said "so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research."Going forward Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.It's not only the diet she repeated. It's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet Redman said. "But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease.",Health
This is part two of a two-part feature. Part 1: Curbing salt intake could add years to your life (CNN)We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.When cutting back on sodium it's important to start slowly as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. "If you try to make chicken soup with no salt you will notice the difference" said Sonya Angelone a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use. You can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods or make your own versions like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example canned tomato sauce can have 1000 milligrams of sodium per serving. "But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth" to make a sauce Angelone said.Using herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili while blends containing rosemary thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes Angelone explained.When dining out ask for steamed vegetables and fish and skip the sauces. And when food shopping compare the sodium values of similar foods. "Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet according to the American Heart Association along with cold cuts and cured meats pizza soup sandwiches and poultry. Be sure to look for hidden sources of sodium. Code words for sodium on food labels include fleur de sel monosodium glutamate  and disodium guanylate. And don't be fooled by different forms of salt which may appear healthier than they are. "Himalyan pink salt or kosher salt or sea salt all have the same amount of sodium" Angelone said. And reduce the amount of processed food you eat. Salt vs. sodium and the problem with processed foodsSodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in foods and enters our diets through processed foods. White salt crystals are technically a combination of sodium and chloride. In fact by weight salt is about 40% sodium and 60% chloride.If you sprinkle a teaspoon of salt on your food regularly cutting it out will eliminate a day's worth of sodium. But that's just skimming sodium's surface because only 11% of the sodium in our diets comes from the salt shaker which we may grab during cooking or eating. About 15% of sodium in a typical American diet occurs naturally in foods. But the rest -- more than 70% -- comes from sodium in packaged prepared and restaurant foods including canned soups frozen foods and lunch meats. Some of top 25 foods that add the most sodium to your diet include pizza cold cuts burritos soup cheese milk eggs rice and cake.  Manufacturers add sodium to help preserve food and enhance the flavor and texture. But they are contributing to our increasingly high sodium intake. If less sodium is added to foods during processing it's much easier for consumers to cut back. To help Americans achieve recommended sodium levels the Food and Drug Administration recently proposed voluntary sodium reformulation targets for processed foods. Potassium-rich foods: An important part of a salt detoxIn addition to limiting sodium experts say that focusing on increasing potassium-rich foods is an important part of a salt detox. "Sodium stiffens your arteries ... but potassium does the opposite" Angelone said. To maximize your salt detox Angelone recommends limiting overly processed foods that contain a lot of sodium and replacing them with more potassium-rich produce as well as unsalted nuts beans and legumes."By eating less salty processed foods and more simple fresh foods you are going to automatically consume less sodium and more potassium" she said. Finally when you choose to consume salty snacks and foods be sure to savor them. "If you are going to have salt have it in something that really matters. ... It makes food taste good but make sure it really counts" Angelone said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.,Health
 (CNN)"Intermittent fasting" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce Hugh Jackman Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.The method is not appropriate for everyone however particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad. "The jury is still out especially on how healthy sustainable and realistic this approach is" said Samantha Heller a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. "Eating very low calories or none on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food."If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.Pick the level of fasting you can handleThe appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity. One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day whereas an approach known as the "5:2" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days during which anything can be eaten in any amount. Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day especially if you tend to skip breakfast alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain."People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult" said Kristen Smith a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.For the greatest success Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food such as a chef.Focus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting daysProtein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies grilled chicken over spaghetti squash an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt two cups of plain popcorn a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days. Don't gorge on non-fasting daysOur bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days when we do eat our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available Heller explained. "We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want" she said. That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. "Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day" Smith said. In other words having pancakes with bacon for breakfast a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.Don't go overboard with exercise on fasting daysStrenuous exercise such as cycling running high-impact aerobics and weight lifting is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity Heller explained. If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days Smith recommends sticking with walking stretching or gentle yoga.Drink enough waterIf you decide to avoid food for any length of time adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. "On a fasting day someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals which is a common time people hydrate" Smith said. Foods such as fruits vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages as they may contribute to dehydration Smith said.Know when to stop If you experience lightheadedness dizziness fatigue nausea headachesdifficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning you should stop fasting."If any of these symptoms occur it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you" Smith said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.,Health
Not long ago fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.Sugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose) sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup refined flours condiments soft drinks sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.The diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes heart disease and some cancers.And it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.But you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods eating more vegetables cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.At best the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.Diet mentalityThe sugar-free diet is restrictive with lists of "allowed" foods (such as whole grains blueberries and grapefruits) and "not allowed" foods (such as white bread bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.People who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.Research shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.Dieting is stressful. In response to this our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol which may cause the body to store fat particularly in the abdominal area.Worrying about food can lead to stress anxiety and depression and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia.Sugar in the diet may increase risks of opioid addictionOrthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to or a form of an eating disorder.Estimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.But we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice however well-intentioned doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.Cutting out the good stuffSome sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.These diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive "healthy" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper "unhealthy" fruits such as bananas.Whole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre essential vitamins and minerals as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.Many sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk yoghurt and cheese due to the assumption these contain sugars.The sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate) which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.Sugar replacementsStrangely many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content) maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.However these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue and dates which contain fibre.Is the food industry conspiring to make you fat?People often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.What to do insteadEat plenty of plants enjoy whole grains beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.Most people could probably eat a little less sugar a little less often but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.Savour every mouthful of that chocolate cake or "sometimes food". Turn off technology and eat the cake mindfully so that your brain can register that you have eaten it. That way you can get pleasure and satisfaction from it and you won't be craving it again an hour later.No matter how we choose to eat remember that health is not simply about the number on the scale the size of our waist or the foods we avoid. It's also about our psychological health and our relationship with food which is just as important as our physical health.Tara Leong is a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at the University of the Sunshine Coast.Copyright 2018 The Conversation.

 (CNN)Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Which food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims? Oats and barleyThe cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan which has a host of benefits for human health.  Studies show that it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health."Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body" CNN contributor and registered dietitian Lisa Drayer said. "So if you have high cholesterol it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis." Other grains such as rye wheat and sorghum contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. Beta-glucans are also found in seaweed baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi shiitake and maitake.Research shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. According to Heart UK a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.Heart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (⅔ cup) of cooked pearl barley.Salmon and other fatty fishFish oils especially omega-3 fatty acids are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon albacore tuna mackerel herring lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3 which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Long-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm. Studies show that they also make blood less likely to clot lower blood pressure keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!The shorter chain of omega-3 called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is found abundantly in oils plants nuts and seeds but evidence of its benefit is not as strong."The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA" Drayer said. "And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body."Fatty fish like salmon have the most long-chain omega-3s and the American Heart Association recommends adding a 3½-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury the association says such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.However Drayer says be careful how you prepare your catch."You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them" Drayer said. "For example if you deep-fry fish all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally you want to broil bake grill or poach -- but in water not in oil.  Oil will contribute lots of extra calories.  If a menu doesn't specify ask how the fish is poached."What if fatty fish is just not your thing?"If you never eat fish you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health" Drayer said. "There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s" added registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Some of them are eggs milk juices peanut butter and margarine spreads.""So instead of having regular spread on your toast you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit" Drayer said. "Why not give yourself an added edge?"Be aware that most fortified foods have a fraction of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.Dark leafy greens Salad greens spinach kale swiss chard collard and mustard greens are rich in vitamins A C E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their abundance of calcium magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health."Potassium magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation" said Al Bochi who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease."Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure" she explained "And it along with magnesium and calcium help the walls of the blood vessels relax which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure."Greens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements so pile that plate high.  Plus greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber which helps lower cholesterol levels prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and by helping you feel full helps with weight control. And of course maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health. Nuts and seedsUnsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure. Studies on pistachios for example find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance) heart rate blood pressure and cholesterol. According to one study a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.Walnuts pecans almonds flaxseed macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still that's good for the heart."Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s" Drayer said "alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease."  But keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association recommended serving is going to seem tiny: about 1½ ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.BeetsA surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide which studies show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact a small study of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2½ cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours. That's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation such as arthritis cancer and heart failure. Avocados Already eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds researchers say.Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids which can lower both your total cholesterol and your "bad" cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your "good" cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit insulin control which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.Olive oilMonounsaturated fatty acids are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet which has been shown to improve heart health and brain health lower risk for breast cancer and increase longevity.A key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats such as butter. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.  HDL is often called the "friendly scavenger" because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.A recent study of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.  Regardless of how it works olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.LegumesNo heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes which include all kinds of beans lentils chickpeas and black-eyed peas. Legumes help the heart because of their high levels of soluble fiber which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. "Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste" Al Bochi said. "You can think of it as a type of sponge."Studies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved blood pressure and a randomized controlled trial found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference weight triglycerides and blood pressure.Legumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron manganese copper B vitamins magnesium zinc and phosphorous and they are very low on the glycemic index which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.One caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt of course can raise blood pressure."Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming" Al Bochi said.  "And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn canned peas carrots any type of canned food it's important to remove the salt."Low-fat dairyIt may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods but it turns out that milk cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure. In a study by Boston University researchers followed the eating habits of 75000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure but it was nothing like yogurt said the researchers. Men in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker."Dairy products contain calcium potassium and magnesium which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control" Al Bochi said.  Those in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's DASH diet which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat and limit your intake of salt.The DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day four to six servings of vegetables four to six servings of fruit two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes."You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient" Drayer said.In the Boston study men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.Though the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten experts stress choosing low-fat versions."Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat so be sure to choose low-fat products" Al Bochi said. "Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease."A low-sodium balanced diet No. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors."If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis say oats or salmon that's OK" Drayer said "but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best because you're getting a different nutrient package with each."The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods" Drayer added. "For example some people say 'I eat a lot of kale so I'm healthy' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet."Unless your doctor says otherwise part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders called the "Salty Six": breads and rolls cold cuts and cured meats sandwiches pizza soup and chicken."Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in your diet is to limit the amount of processed foods the amount of frozen dinners for example as well as adding salt to foods yourself" Al Bochi said. "Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals."Finally a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise weight loss stress reduction and not smoking.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated where beta-glucans are absorbed in the body.,Health
"Fit Nation: Around the World in 8 Races" will air three times on Saturday September 15 between 1 and 6 p.m. ET and one time between 5 and 6 p.m. ET on Sunday September 16. (CNN)Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible Jesus rode one not a horse into Jerusalem. The significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant though that's not in the official canon. I checked.Domesticated for about 5000 years donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car our U-Haul vans engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.Burros as the Spanish call them walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.Like a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact they're the camels of the East North and South too as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America Europe Asia and Africa. As some industries faded the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race. "They teach us so much" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. "They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul."The first race was in 1949 which makes it according Wann the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon. The race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation. There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.But it's still a serious sport even if it has a sense of humor. "Haulin' Ass" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.A burro-ful dayOriginally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.Now both towns have their own races part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay is the longest (29 miles) tied for highest (more than 13000 feet) and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.Race day in July was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150000 people showed up to watch the start of the race. The smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.The start of the race is critical explained Wann. "Don't break their will let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down" he explained. "Burros will pair up and want to go that pace and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race not a human race."The course also ends in Fairplay running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode) and then heading up dirt roads trails and rocky terrain to the 13185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?) The age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70 and they came from all over the US Europe Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado the state where it was born. About a third of the runners were women this year. In fact the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller with her burro Pill in 1951 nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules even then). The donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course. And don't call donkeys mules which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.Rules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick gold pan shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.Like any ultramarathon especially with elevation endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result there are of course comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races teams have had to drop out when this happens. The air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions the views as wild and West as some of pack animals.This year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too collectively known as the Triple Crown. Breaking in"In the whole world there are probably fewer than 1000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012 pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)If you want to be among this elite crew your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances — putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.Then there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible. There are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. "If the burro doesn't trust you or like you or you are pushing too hard" said Wann "it's not going to work." Organizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann a self described "donkey matchmaker" and wife of Brad rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience."Burro racing is a very mental game" he added. "We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen."Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take literally. Sometimes you're pulling them other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. On flats either teammate can be in the lead or side-by-side but human runners are still doing the steering. You control a donkey through their nose pulling back on the rope to slow down like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a "hup-hup!" can get 'em goin' and the classic "whoa" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the "GPS for the critters" Wann said. Gear-wise runners need the right shoes clothes running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.Ass-essing risk and rewardAs with any ultramarathon trail run injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1212 active ultrarunners they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.Being tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners of course. If you trip you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest. The rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey but in the race's history injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back as they're out of the race anyway. Donkeys get injured too but in 70 years of racing not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery. Animal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. "Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified" the race rules state. "No needles electric prods narcotics clubs or whips other than the halter rope may be used." But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous. Organizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. "If you observe donkeys in the wild they aren't sedentary creatures" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. "In the wild donkeys are very trim athletic animals" and "they exercise all day long." "They are willing participants" Thompson writes alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. "If they don't want to go you can't make them do anything.",Health
 (CNN)You might think you're fairly intelligent but are you emotionally intelligent?It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.Most of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.But many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence according to Brackett a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.That's important because experts say the ability to read understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health happiness and personal and professional success.So maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.What is emotional intelligence?The theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey the 23rd president of Yale University and John "Jack" Mayer professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire wrote up the theory in 1990 Brackett said.Their work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior said Robin Stern associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator author and licensed psychoanalyst.Experts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. "Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions" she said.It's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others said Sara Canaday a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic can look at situations from an alternative point of view are considered open-minded bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face according to Canaday."Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world" Stern said. "People with more emotional intelligence are healthier happier and more effective" Brackett said.Why emotional intelligence mattersCanaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive résumé or a high IQ score.Wait really?Well ... just reflect on your own work experiences Canaday suggests. Has anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?  "We might be hired for technical talents but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence" Canaday said.Individuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful she said but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence. "It is how well you can collaborate how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart."Emotional intelligence testsBehavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments usually broken down into "your ability to manage yourself your ability to manage relationships your self-awareness and your social awareness" according to Canaday. Your results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence. But Brackett warns that "measurement is a tricky subject." In his early research he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them. Another form of an emotional intelligence test is a "360 assessment." In the workplace setting a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often "see ourselves differently than others do."When a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser perhaps a current or former boss to evaluate your emotional intelligence she said. But Canaday cautions If you ask for someone's feedback be prepared to accept what they share. "This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand we say we want to learn and grow but on the other hand we want to be accepted just the way we are and those two human traits run counter."Can I improve my emotional intelligence?So maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that? From the earliest ages children should be taught how to recognize their emotions understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves Stern said. For adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. "Pick one or two areas where you want to grow and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop." If you are trying to gain better control of your anger for example you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing. Canaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. "Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do then you are hearing the same conversations and you are not growing and you are not learning to be open to perspectives."Brackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to "spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions be more self- and socially aware about your presence." Stern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions. How we talk to ourselves can also have a huge impact on our emotions and our health if that self-talk is not positive Stern says. She suggests that we would never talk to another individual the way we often talk to ourselves. "There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are allowed themselves to have emotions made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world we would in fact have a better world." ,Health
 (CNN)Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk and a new study reveals how.The study published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology found that women with high cardiovascular fitness or high stamina had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit."I was not surprised that there was an association but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk" said Helena Hörder a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was first author on the study.Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. Alzheimer's disease an irreversible and progressive brain disease is the most common type of dementia.About 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.About 850000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole according to the UK's National Health Service.Worldwide about 50 million people have dementia and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year according to the World Health Organization.The new study involved 191 women in Sweden 38 to 60 years old who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.During the test the women's workload was measured based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued."The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure in watts of your work capacity" Hörder said. "Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity."Some of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload before being pushed to maximal capacity mainly due to changes seen on an electrocardiograph or due to high blood pressure.Based on their crude peak workload the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the "low fitness" group 92 were "medium fitness" and 40 were "high fitness."Those cycling tests were conducted in 1968 and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time the researchers tracked the women's health taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.The researchers found that among all of the women 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload that percentage jumped to 45%."Many of those who interrupted the test at submax very low watt level probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status" Hörder said. "This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis."The researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the "high fitness" group than in the "medium fitness" group and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: "High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%" the researchers wrote.The study had some limitations including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger more diverse group.Also the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.For instance other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk as well as the social aspects of fitness as loneliness has been linked to dementia."One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations and they can't necessarily talk about causality" said Keith Fargo director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago who was not involved in the new study.Still he said "the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife not just old age when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias."The new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors such as poor cardiovascular health a sedentary lifestyle poor diet smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.So people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise stopping smoking eating a healthy diet getting enough sleep staying socially engaged challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health according to the Alzheimer's Association."There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain" Fargo said. "The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ meaning that your brain has many blood vessels" he said. "The demand for nutrient- oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health.",Health
 (CNN)High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018. Such training known as HIIT typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds for example during a moderate-pace jog.The US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children noted Walter R. Thompson author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. "So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from say walking to jogging it decreases to 75 minutes per week."HIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines he said. "But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything there may be an increased risk of injury." If you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts Thompson recommends that you "get a good physical exam" before starting a program.Over the past 12 years the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals including personal trainers and physical therapists to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year. This year's survey which included responses from 4133 fitness professionals around the globe placed "group training" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile "wearable technology" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third and "body weight training" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. "Strength training" or the use of barbells and weights placed fifth.  Thompson said the survey was developed for two purposes the first being "to help guide the fitness industry." Although most of the industry is "commercial properties" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers."They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something they know it's going to work" Thompson said. "We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym the clients" he said. "It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs."Three new trends found a place on the top 20 list: "licensure for fitness professionals" "core training" and "sport-specific Training." Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport such as tennis or boxing.Meanwhile "work-site health promotion" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and "outcomes measures" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.One of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the "re-emergence of group exercise programs" said Thompson who remembers "back in the day when that was all we did." Personal training which was introduced around 2000 reduced the popularity of group training he noted.  However after the recession less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. "It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses" Thompson said.Another trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs. Most gyms "still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket" Thompson said. But the "really smart clubs" are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work "so that now the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym" he said. "It makes total sense." Finally yoga remains in the top 10 where it has been since the survey started Thompson said. "Yoga keeps reinventing itself.",Health
 (CNN)If you ask almost any fitness professional how to lose your love handles they will tell you two things: No amount of abdominal crunches will make a difference if you don't first improve your diet and exercise regimen. And there is no such thing as "spot reducing" when it comes to fat loss so you can't target this area alone. Love handles the pinchable fat on both sides of your stomach that leads to a "muffin top" appearance are especially stubborn. They do not respond as quickly to diet and exercise changes as the more dangerous visceral fat that is deep within your abdomen and leads to more of a "potbelly" appearance. If you are a woman and your waist is larger than 35 inches around or a man with a waist size greater than 40 inches you will lose the deep belly fat first. This is actually better for your health as visceral fat has been linked to numerous medical issues including high blood pressure high cholesterol pre-diabetes and inflammation. To lose the subcutaneous fat that forms not-so-lovable love handles (or excess fat on your hips thighs and buttocks) it's going to take even more time and effort. What is the best diet for losing your love handles? The one you can stick with long-term as it's not going to be quick or easy for most people. This is especially true for men as this is often the last place on their body where they lose weight. In terms of specific exercise recommendations three top trainers shared the advice they give their A-list clients. Gunnar Peterson who trains Hollywood actors and professional athletes including the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers advocates a comprehensive lifestyle approach that includes clean eating adequate sleep stress management plenty of hydration and sprint work mixed with steady-state cardio on alternate days to optimize fat burning. Sprint work also known as high-intensity interval training involves alternating periods of maximum effort with periods of recovery (not be confused with rest). The duration of sprints can increase and recovery periods can decrease as your fitness levels improve. Steady-state cardio involves working out at approximately 65% to 85% of your maximum heart rate for at least 30 minutes. One exercise Peterson does not recommend for reducing love handles is side bends with heavy weights. This type of exercise can actually exacerbate the appearance of love handles by increasing the size of the underlying external oblique muscles. Instead he recommends working all of the abdominal muscles not just the obliques in multiple planes of motion. Exercises that reach those areas include wood chops medicine ball rotations medicine ball slams (at a variety of angles) and banded overhead extensions side to side and back to front.Ami Jampolis a top San Francisco Bay Area trainer (and full disclosure my sister) recommends high-intensity circuit training several times a week to build or maintain calorie-burning muscle along with several days of steady-state cardiovascular training. High-intensity circuit training involves alternating strength training exercises (such as a pushup) and short bouts of cardiovascular exercises (such as jumping jacks) with minimal rest in between. This type of training is gaining popularity for its fast pace and time efficiency and can be done at home or at a gym that specializes in this type of training. For homing in on the oblique muscles Jampolis agrees with Peterson about avoiding side bends with weights. Instead she suggests two very simple yet effective exercises that don't seem to have the bulking effect on the oblique abdominal muscles: side planks and bicycles. Both can be done anywhere and don't require any equipment.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Integrate at-home interval training into your workout routine with these beginner-friendly productsCelebrity trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak takes an even simpler approach to losing your love handles. In addition to cleaning up their diets he gives all his clients fitness trackers to ensure that they meet his required 12000 steps per day and seven hours of sleep per night. He finds that higher-intensity training can often increase appetite making it harder to stick to a diet so he prefers simply walking along with regular strength training that includes working each major body part at least once per week. Although their approaches may vary professionals agree with the popular saying "abs are made in the kitchen not the gym." If you really want to lose your love handles start by finding a diet plan that works for you and that you can stick with long-term and then build in an exercise program that works with your current fitness level exercise preference budget and schedule. How to do a side plank: Lying on your side lift your body onto your forearm keeping hips feet and shoulders stacked over one another. Aim to hold this position for as long as possible increasing the time as you get stronger. Make sure not to collapse into your upper back. If your balance is a little off you can place one foot in front of the other for more stability. Switch sides and repeat three times. As you advance you can drop your hips to the floor and then bring them back up to the side plank position 15 to 20 times and repeat three sets per side.How to do bicycles: Lie on your back with both knees bent at a 90-degree angle and place your hands behind your head. Fully extend one leg out about 6 inches above the ground bringing your opposite elbow to the opposite knee. With control bring the extended leg in and extend the other leg out simultaneously bringing the other elbow to the opposite knee. Make sure to twist from your stomach and not your neck. Control is key on this exercise; speed is not your friend. Aim for switching every two seconds. Aim for three sets of 60 (30 per leg).

The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.Even the 150 doctors dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising gap in their health literacy. The most common misconception by far was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter which all chemical reactions obey.Some respondents thought fat turns into muscle which is impossible and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.So if not energy muscles or the loo where does fat go?The enlightening facts about fat metabolismThe correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.If you lose 10 pounds of fat precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.This surprises just about everyone but actually almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.Protein shares the same fate except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids which you excrete as urine.Why is obesity getting worse in America?The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and after that it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.Kilograms in versus kilograms outWe all learn that "energy in equals energy out" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity.The reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms too not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.According to the latest government figures Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water.What's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen too and this figure is equally important for your waistline.If you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces) then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight more than 4.1kg will have to go.Want to fix America's health? First focus on foodThe 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates fats protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.An average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure despite the bold claims you might have heard.The good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.Eat less exhale moreSo if fat turns into carbon dioxide could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.But here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours you'd exhale more than 1200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.More realistically going for a walk triples your metabolic rate and so will cooking vacuuming and sweeping.Metabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.Therefore to lose 100 ounces of fat you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food no matter what you eat.Any diet that supplies less "fuel" than you burn will do the trick but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works few of us know why.Ruben Meerman is an assistant scientist at the University of New South Wales and author of "Big Fat Myths: When You Lose Weight Where Does the Fat Go?"

 (CNN)We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. "I love you" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world spoken millions of times every day. "I love you" translates intimacy between ourselves and others but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system where we process love. Psychologist Abraham Maslow created a "hierarchy of needs" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve with love cited as a basic need after safety food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth a deep sense of belonging an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people. Still how do we arrive at a loving state?Researchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing "I love you." Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. "It is possible for people to feel loved in simple everyday scenarios" explained the study's lead researcher Zita Oravecz. "It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures." Here are easy and effective ways to communicate "I love you." Read: Valentine's Day: Managing the pressureGive a small personalized gift Gifts are common enough that they can become as generic an exchange as "I love you" -- but not if you consider the receiver and tailor it to them. A sense of humor helps too. Author Sue Shapiro suggests "Instead of flowers or candy (which don't do anything for me) my husband will bring me a ream of paper and a little bottle of Wite-Out when he knows I have a deadline. True love! And I feel like someone actually knows me." Make foodMake someone's favorite dessert "just because" or give a freezable dinner to a busy friend. One study found evidence that offering food is seen as a form of affection and sharing food an indicator of love. Take that a step further and you could say cooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing altruistic act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness according to one study. Making food as way to express love explained dating expert and author James Michael Sama "brings people together in gatherings and celebrations and can be used as a bonding experience with cooking and sharing." This combination of doing an altruistic creative act while fulfilling someone's need to eat is mutually good for well being and feeling loved. CuddleCozy up. Researchers recruited nearly 500 Americans to answer a questionnaire featuring 60 common interactions and explain whether those activities give them feelings of love. "A child snuggling up to you" received 97% consensus on a hypothetical action that would make them feel loved. Besides boosting loving feelings cuddling lowers stress and boosts immunity according to one study. Call or write a note out of the blueWe often reach out to wish someone a happy birthday arrange plans or ask for help. Try contacting someone to ask how they are or simply to chat. Doing so has the potential to produce tenderness. More than 90% of that questionnaire's participants agreed that "someone calling to check in out of the blue" made them feel loved.Take a task off their 'to do' listPut away the dishes from the dishwasher. Fold the laundry without being asked. Pick up milk from the store. Relieving someone's burden even a minor one demonstrates care. "Try to pinpoint the small things someone does for you that warms your heart" said Saeideh Heshmati a co-author of the Penn State study and a postdoctoral research scholar there. "Once you find those little things try to savor them and preserve that feeling. As you're aware you're more prone to perceive them as love." ,Health
 (CNN)Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia a new study suggests.The paper published Monday in the journal Nature Reviews Cancer finds that acute lymphoblastic leukemia the most common type of childhood cancer is caused by a two-step process. The first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.More specifically children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia the paper says.The author Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves suggests the cancer could be preventable.Greaves reviewed more than 30 years of research including his own on the genetics cell biology immunology epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered "why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.""This body of research is a culmination of decades of work and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops" he said in a statement. "The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed."However other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia known as ALL is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly over days or weeks building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.Rates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018 with 1470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK according to Cancer Research UK.While a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced affluent societies which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life. Previous claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.The body of research "busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution" said Greaves.Greaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year its immune system is strengthened. But later infections without the initial priming can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.Population studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL probably by priming the immune system according to the study.Greaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia probably have different causal mechanisms."Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe" said Paul Workman chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research London.However other experts are more cautiously hopeful emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL."If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality" said Alasdair Rankin director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise."There is no proven link yet with a specific infection" said Dr. Donna Lancaster consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. "This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.Sheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain."It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system" said Cruickshank in a statement. "Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review."The research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However Charles Swanton chief clinician of Cancer Research UK stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed."This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs dirt and illness" Swanton said. "We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.",Health
 (CNN)If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other it is confidence.I've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure. Growing up as a perfectionist somewhat fearful of both failure and success I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.For all these reasons I was thrilled when one of my daughters during the first grade had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now "What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?"Journalist author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014 she and her co-author Katty Kay anchor of BBC World News America published "The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know." The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.As Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book one of the most common questions they would get was from parents women and men who were concerned about their daughters." 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter' " Shipman said they would say. "It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' "  Shipman who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school although it is applicable for girls up through high school Shipman says.In "The Confidence Code for Girls: Taking Risks Messing Up Your Amazingly Imperfect Totally Powerful Self" Shipman and Kay use graphic novel illustrations quizzes checklists and real stories from girls to try to make the topic accessible and relatable.They also commissioned an online poll which backs up what other research has shown.Between the ages of 8 and 14 girls' confidence drops by 30% according to the survey of nearly 1400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians. The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing"We were surprised at how quickly how deep that drop is" Shipman said. "And especially because right until age 8 there's really no difference in confidence levels."So how do we stop this troubling trend? I asked Shipman a mom of two  for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter with good results.1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.One of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters Shipman said is to help them get "comfortable being uncomfortable." Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks they will have succeeded.As for how to do that a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. "It's kind of counterintuitive but just telling yourself 'Oh you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary" Shipman said.So encourage your daughter and tell her "Yes it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway' " Shipman said.2. Have her keep a list of risks.Having your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.Also have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation such as "I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it."3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'Our girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. "We all need a cheat sheet to failure" Shipman and Kay write.They offer a list of 10 "failure fixes" such as "change the channel." Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place whether that is reading a book watching TV listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.Another fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor which she called a "virtual hot air balloon ride." Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. "First that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective like 'Wow look other things are going on' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way."Trying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. "Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!" they write.4. Role model failure and struggle. One of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.How could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual."Perfectionism or worry about this or that or sort of reticence to raise your hand that's recognizable to us" Shipman said. "Even if instinctively we know it's wrong it doesn't seem odd because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it whereas I think fathers who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange."The takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us especially mothers dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks."If we're going on 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right' it doesn't help them" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and "lift the veil a little bit."When she's upset about something for instance such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.With all the talk about girls and confidence it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence."It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys" Shipman said. "I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on essentially the world doesn't operate like school."Helping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers Shipman said."Girls even when they speak up in class or whatever it is they want to please people so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them" Shipman said. "And when they speak up some people will like what they say and others won't and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK because I'm me.' " ,Health
 (CNN)A few years ago when my girls were in the second and third grades they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.Their teachers would put on a video which encouraged the kids to get up and dance and then they'd get back to work. "What a brilliant idea" I remember thinking at the time.My kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.Groups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.It all seems like a no-brainer especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse. As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated let's get our kids to move.The challenge though is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training. Research: Physical activity benefits studentsJust as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy they can teach physical literacy teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life said Susan Kamin chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.The for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides "BrainErgizer" videos five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain. Dr. John Ratey an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain."When you move you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with and when you stimulate those nerve cells it gets them ready to do stuff" said Ratey an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of "Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the "attention systems" of the brain."When you exercise you turn on the attention systems so that means you're (paying) better attention you're able to deal with more frustration you're able to stay with it longer" he said. "You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it."A recent study a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math. The study published in the journal Pediatrics involved more than 10000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity especially physical education improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement especially math-related skills and reading."The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results academically" Kamin said. "It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom because if kids are able to move they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out."Breakthrough Magnet School South a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford Connecticut is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before but since the partnership the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience Principal Julie Goldstein said."I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured" Goldstein said.Her third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district she said. Beyond the benefits academically there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy she might have had one or two office referrals every month she said."This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings disagreements and even injuries at recess time and we've had none so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom" she said. "Even during the unstructured times they're better able to manage themselves to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to which is to give them time to play and have fun."Using screens to get kids moving Four out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom the company says.The concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos often about two minutes in length that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.KC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+ which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos games and classroom resources.)Estenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who like most parents has struggled with how much time his kids ages 8 12 and 14 spend on screens during the day."GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active" Estenson said. "The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen which is active engagement versus passive engagement and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive binge viewing hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else."The key he said is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12 grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness."And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there" said Estenson.'It really validates ... what teachers know'Active Schools which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative is a national movement partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.The goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play."One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' " said Charlene Burgeson executive director of Active Schools.Streamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money time and philosophy.Schools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum."I know lots of teachers who say 'Yeah I wish I had more time to do this' " the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be she said."It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke why fix it?'  Yet the schools that have made the leap see tremendous results. So how do you move the needle?",Health
 (CNN)We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.From the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.Of course you can't. Even that "Prince Charming" narrative in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return is everywhere.But what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.Even before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women even in children's programming.Research shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.Let me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10. Helping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits which brings me to "Andi Mack" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.Think about the storyline which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character Andi learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys and Cyrus who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.My girls ages 10 and 11 and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.'A girl can do anything a boy can do'TerrI Minksy the creator and executive producer of "Andi Mack" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof."There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made" said Minsky who made the pilot with a predominantly female team."I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power."Sofia Wylie plays Buffy who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia 14 believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch."I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference" said Sofia also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on "America's Got Talent.""So many people say 'Oh yeah boys are just like stronger' and when a boy says that I'm going to contain myself now" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. "It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man."Even today in 2018 a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well."People think if you're competitive that means you're mean" she said. "No she's competitive for a separate reason because she's been told that she has to be strong." In one episode we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom who is in the military is away during months-long deployments.A story line with #MeToo resonanceOne of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.And then Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom Bex she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when I would argue many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves "Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?" Lilan Bowden who plays Bex Andi's independent and individualistic mother says she wishes she had "Andi Mack" when she was a girl. Instead the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy the boy finally says he likes her back and they get together."That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice eventually you'll get what you want" Bowden said. "And to have that character to say 'I was nice and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge."Minsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement. When Andi expresses herself to Jonah she's the one who is in charge for the first time said Minsky who also created "Lizzie McGuire" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit. "It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances and the boy's sitting back and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself and he's like 'Oh wow I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me' and I kind of feel 'yeah I bet you did.' " (In another sign of the show's relatable nature it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)Peyton Elizabeth Lee who plays Andi said she Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was "finally finding her voice.""Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute and he's fun and he has so many friends and he's popular and he's athletic and whatever' but when it really comes down to it he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him" said Peyton 13 who has appeared on ABC's "Scandal" and "Shameless" on Showtime."I think she was realizing that she's worth more so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete."Gender equality in media? Long way to go There is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film. Research commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25% when women make up just about half of the actual work force. Fictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.We know that when you see it you can be it. In a survey of 1000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.Sixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics. Bowden who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy hopes shows like "Andi Mack" are a marker for what is to come. When she got to Hollywood and was auditioning there was a very limited selection of roles for women she said. "It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy" she said. "I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model."This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning" she said. With surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive."I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself" Sofia told my daughters. "I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is we're all ourselves."Added Peyton "A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer it all works out. If you're nice you get friends. You have a boyfriend but it's just not like that and you have to find that balance of being nice but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go.",Health
 (CNN)Several former NFL players called Thursday for an end to tackle football for kids ages 13 and under.Pro football Hall of Famers Nick Buoniconti and Harry Carson joined four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Phil Villapiano and researchers from Boston University to make the announcement. They're working with the Concussion Legacy Foundation to support a new parent education initiative Flag Football Under 14 that pushes for no tackle football until the age of 14. "I beg of you all parents to please don't let your children play football until high school" said Buoniconti 77 who has been diagnosed with dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy a neurodegenerative disease."I made the mistake starting tackle football at 9 years old. Now CTE has taken my life away. Youth tackle football is all risk with no reward."Buoniconti helped the Miami Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl appearances including two wins and an undefeated season in 1972 the only such season in all of NFL history. In November he said he intended to donate his brain to research. New York Giants legend Carson echoed Buoniconti's sentiments."I did not play tackle football until high school I will not allow my grandson to play until 14 as I believe it is not an appropriate sport for young children" Carson said. Villapiano is best known for his big plays for the Oakland Raiders. He said that witnessing how CTE ravaged his teammate and friend Ken Stabler is causing him to speak out about the dangers of tackle football for children under 14."At some point those of us who have had success in this game must speak up to protect both football players and the future of the game and supporting 'Flag Football Under 14' is our best way to do that" he said.How CTE beginsThe players along with researchers Chris Nowinski of the Concussion Legacy Foundation and Dr. Robert Cantu and Dr. Lee Goldstein of Boston University pointed to studies that showed CTE can start early in life and without any signs of concussion. A study co-authored by Goldstein and published Thursday in the journal Brain came to that conclusion. It found some changes in the brain occurred as early as 24 hours after injury.Goldstein and his colleagues advocate for no tackle football before 14 because children's bodies particularly their necks and upper bodies aren't strong enough to counteract the bobbling of the head and shaking of the brain that occurs during tackles. Dr. Julian Bailes the director of neurosurgery and co-director of NorthShore University HealthSystem Neurological Institute and medical director for Pop Warner said the concern over repeated hits is magnified in high school after kids are 14."The real exposure to larger players higher velocity hits and hundreds of hits starts in high school" he said. Goldstein said parents should heed the warning that CTE can develop early -- and the focus on concussions doesn't reduce the risk. "The NFL is setting a bad example by focusing on the concussion and while not focusing on the hits" said Goldstein. The NFL and Dr. Allen Sills it's chief medical officer did not respond when asked whether the league is considering changing its CTE and concussion protocol because of the recent study. "As highlighted in this recent study repetitive hits to the head have been consistently implicated as a cause of CTE by this research group. How and why exactly this manifests who is at risk and why -- these are questions that we as researchers and clinicians are working to answer" Sills said.  Sills noted changes the NFL has made to reduce head-to-head contact over the years including limiting how much players can wear their helmets off-season and limiting full-padded practices during the season. The NFL has also made grants and supported brain science.Goldstein said concussions remain the red herring of CTE. "We will never prevent CTE by focusing on concussions. Any meaningful prevention campaign has to focus on preventing all hits to the head including sub-concussive impacts" said Goldstein.And one way to do that he said is to limit overall exposure to hits by waiting to play tackle football. Carson the former linebacker noted that "the game is more popular now.""Parents should understand exactly what they are signing their kids up for" he said.CNN's Kwegyirba Croffie contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)Sexting among teens and younger children has increased over the past decade and poses a growing challenge for educators and parents according to a new study. One in four young people said they'd received sexts and one in seven reported sending them according to the study which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016 with a total of 110380 participants all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11. The researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people. The increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.With that trend in mind the study's authors suggest that "age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education." Why sext?The researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people."As teens get older we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior" said study co-author Jeff Temple a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch. "It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are."Kami Kosenko a communications professor at North Carolina State University agreed: "As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication of which sexting is a part." Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.Teens sometimes 'assume safety' The study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved especially among younger children that is a cause for concern the researchers said.Preteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail."As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting" Temple said. On average children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones. Danger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private although this may not be the case. "Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not" said study co-author Sheri Madigan an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary. "Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect" Madigan said. "When they send a picture they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture." Kosenko said that "with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety."Part of the problem lies in the children's brains Madigan said. "Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting."There is little or no literature on tweens  and sexting according to Madigan who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic. Nonconsensual sextingAccording to the study 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver."That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting they can talk about those potential risks" Madigan said.Nonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health."If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced that is where you see the negative mental health problems and we see the same thing with sexting" Temple said. According to the study further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting "to appropriately target and inform intervention education and policy efforts."What parents need to knowJAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as "the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages." This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to "prove" how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.The biggest concern according to the journal is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:Start the discussion early with your kids using broad questions such as "have you heard of sexting?"  By understanding what your child already knows you can then frame your conversation. Use examples appropriate for your child's age. Be specific about the possible consequences of sexting. "Parents should be proactive and not reactive" Madigan said. Remind your teenager of their own worth. Let them know that being pressured is not OK and that sexting is not a way to "prove" their love. "If you have the conversation early and often when problems arise then kids know they can go to their parents and talk to them" Madigan said.Being open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting Kosenko said."This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion" she said."You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting.",Health
 (CNN)As a mom of two daughters I'm mindful of how girls today have more opportunity than ever. In fact I tell my girls this all the time: They can be anything they want and shatter any glass ceiling even the highest one the presidency. Be confident and speak up and you can achieve great things we tell our girls. You can play any sport join any after-school club volunteer for any cause and get the grades. In fact girls are regularly outperforming boys in school and enrolling in higher numbers in college.It's a great time to be a girl -- or is it? Because behind all these possibilities is a troubling development: Girls' anxiety and depression are climbing and increasingly turning tragic.Between 2007 and 2015 the suicide rate for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 doubled reaching a 40-year high in 2015 according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics."I think no one can dispute the wholesale kind of collapse of girls' wellness right now" said bestselling author Rachel Simmons who has been working with and doing research on girls for the past two decades."It's really a crisis. I don't think I'm overstating it. Everywhere I go I hear about levels of anxiety that are so crippling that it makes it hard for teachers to teach and we can't not pay attention to this anymore."Simmons points to the findings of a 2015 freshman survey by UCLA of 150000 full-time students at more than 200 colleges and universities.Twice as many girls as boys reported that they felt depressed frequently or occasionally and twice as many girls as boys said they were "overwhelmed with all they had to do" -- a 25% jump in the number of girls in both categories in just over 15 years according to Simmons.What's behind these concerning numbers? As Simmons writes in her new book "Enough As She Is: How to Help Girls Move Beyond Impossible Standards of Success to Live Healthy Happy and Fulfilling Lives" girls are growing up with outsize expectations of personal and professional success. The pressure to be great at everything is causing them to feel less confident more fearful of failure and more critical of themselves Simmons says.Girls' psychology and culture on 'collision course'"There is a deep mismatch in terms of what the culture is telling girls and their most vulnerable parts of their psychology" said Simmons who is also co-founder of the national nonprofit Girls Leadership.Girls are socialized at a very young age to rely heavily on feedback from others. They grow up paying more and more attention to what other people think of them and whether they are measuring up to those external expectations.In today's society that relentless concern about pleasing others is on what Simmons calls a collision course with two cultural changes: the ubiquitousness of social media which is exacerbating the need to perform and heightened expectations of what it means to be a successful girl today."We're now giving girls access to STEM (science technology engineering and math). We're giving girls access to opportunities they've never had before. And we're not doing that and saying 'Oh you don't have to have a bikini body anymore. That's cool. You're good. You can look however you want to look' " Simmons said. "No we're saying 'keep your bikini body and become an engineering major and also have a totally lit Snapchat feed on a Saturday night' and so that's exhausting and I call that role overload and role conflict."Social media alone becomes a "virtual second shift" for young girls almost like a full-time job as they spend more time on average on Instagram and Snapchat that boys do."Social media enables them to curate an exhausting range of identities -- jock scholar beauty queen party girl best friend and on and on -- demanded by the new rules of girl success crammed into a twenty-four-hour day" she writes in "Enough As She Is."Simmons said she wishes she didn't have to write this book. In her bestseller "The Curse of the Good Girl" published in 2009 she wrote about the need to teach girls how to take up space find courage and be confident. But in her work with girls on college campuses and elementary middle and high schools across the country she started to see that the wellness piece was missing."Despite very high levels of achievement girls were struggling with a sense of imposter syndrome low lack of confidence overthinking and an enduring belief that no matter how hard they tried they were not enough of whatever it was" said Simmons who has a young daughter of her own. "Moreover the terms of success that they had established for themselves were so kind of outsized and unrealistic and unhealthy that they were on this hamster wheel of trying to get something they were never going to get."Simmons said she has come to realize that in order to help girls become stronger and more confident we have to attend to their emotional health. "We never thought about girls' leadership as being integrated into their wellness and ... that's the shift that's taking place is that we need to start thinking about wellness in tandem with growing their confidence and growing their achievement."Changing how we teach girls Tara Christie Kinsey head of school at The Hewitt School a girls' private school in New York City and a former dean at Princeton University said that what she and her colleagues in higher education have seen across college campuses for years are young girls with "amazing ... paper resumes" with all the right grades and SAT scores. It "looks amazing on paper and yet the interior life of young women in particular was sorely lacking" said Kinsey who has a daughter in the third grade and a son in the fifth grade. She tells the story of meeting with a female college student when her then-5-year-old daughter burst through the office door so excited to show her mom the contents of her kindergarten folder. When her daughter left "the young woman looked at me and she said 'I remember when I used to have that kind of confidence.' " As an educator and an advocate for girls and women Kinsey said she is focused on the gap between what we know girls need to thrive and be healthy and how we're teaching them every day whether it's in the classroom or in the home."I think that better understanding that gap holds many of the keys to closing yet another gap the success gap between how girls are faring in school -- where we know they're crushing it and they're outperforming boys and they're achieving at levels we've never seen before -- and how they're faring in life after school" Kinsey said. "They're coming up against not only a structural glass ceiling but also a psychological glass ceiling that thwarts their self-actualization."Kinsey was familiar with Simmons' books and incorporated her research into her work in higher education. When she moved to The Hewitt School she wanted to bring Simmons' teachings and experience to students faculty and parents in the community. In 2016 Simmons was named the inaugural Girls' Research Scholar in Residence at Hewitt.Simmons' work at Hewitt involves helping the girls and young women build their skills in the broad category of emotional intelligence Kinsey said with a focus on healthy risk-taking conflict resolution self-advocacy managing friendships and the giving and receiving of feedback.She may be sprawled on the floor with an entire grade of middle-schoolers tracing their bodies for an exercise on the difference between feelings you sometimes keep inside such as jealousy and feelings you express such as anger. She might be sitting crisscross apple sauce with elementary school girls talking about the difference between a real apology and a not-so-real apology.Or she may be standing on a chair and reciting a poem demonstrating how the pressure to be perfect really undermines the ability to give and receive authentic feedback."What I'm trying to do is fill in the blanks in terms of some of the skills that they don't have" Simmons said. "So sure they're really good at doing their worksheets and the homework and sitting quietly in class discussions and taking exams but when something goes off the rails then we're working with them on how do you cope? We're filling in the blanks and I contend that if you fill in the blanks ... then we're going to see a better balance between all of this ... on-paper success and what's happening inside."But right now things are out of whack. We got overdeveloped on paper and very underdeveloped in life and in terms of resilience (and) adaptability."It is that fear of failure that can really be crippling for girls and young women today which is why Simmons who is also a leadership development specialist at Smith College regularly concludes her orientation programs on college campuses with a graduation ceremony. The young women who attend will each receive a "Certificate of Failure."The mock diploma reads "Having honorably fulfilled all the requirements imposed by the overload of high school you are hereby certified to screw up bomb or otherwise fail" during college "and still be a totally worthy utterly excellent human" Simmons writes in her book.The girls laugh she writes but then they take those certificates back to their dorm rooms. "Every girls needs a Certificate of Failure" she writes.Helping parents combat 'not-enoughness'At Hewitt Simmons also works with the teachers helping them see the importance of trying to teach soft skills such as resilience and adaptability just like they are teaching anything else.Instead of giving feedback on written work a teacher might do a one-on-one consultation with the student in which they focus on her goals and what she hopes to achieve in her next writing sample. In math teachers don't typically give girls grades on quizzes; they give written feedback so the girls can learn from their mistakes. "You see how that's just completely transformative to girls and relationships to their own achievement" Kinsey said. "It's not about grades. It's about growth. It's about feedback. It's about failure. It's about honoring mistakes as a necessary part of the learning process."As part of her work at Hewitt Simmons also meets regularly with parents and tries to help them "combat the sense of shame and 'not-enoughness' that so many parents have.""This is an era in which parents are probably the least confident they're ever been in themselves" Simmons said. "If we want our kids to feel like they are enough the parents have to feel like they are enough."During coffee talks she tries to help parents feel comfortable enough to share what they are most afraid of such as concerns that their daughter doesn't have a ton of friends or isn't getting the best grades."We had a couple of faculty members who aren't parents who were sitting there going 'Oh my God. I had no idea that parents were that scared about their kids and all I see is 'my daughter didn't get a good grade on the test' and that anger is actually fear'" Kinsey said. "That anger is fear and what Rachel is doing in such a beautiful way is saying ''if you don't get in touch with that you're not really modeling for girls what they need.' "Muffy Flouret who has a daughter in the seventh grade at Hewitt said Simmons is helping students and parents understand what it means to fail and how to bounce back. "She's on the edge of the research of how do we raise girls in the community and it's invaluable because parents who might not think twice about saying 'Well you didn't get the A. I'm not so happy about that' might now think twice about that reaction" Flouret said.She also said Simmons is helping the community understand the perils of trying to be the best at everything."To create this sort of pressure that you have to be the top of the soccer team and you have to be top of the debate team it's not sustainable and it's not realistic" she said. "Where does that leave you as an adult? You have to be able to bounce back and react to things."Jo-Anne Williams co-chairwoman of the Hewitt Parents' Association who has a daughter in the seventh grade at the school attends nearly every one of Simmons' events with parents. "It really causes you to take a step back and say 'What am I really doing? Am I just trying to create a cookie cutter of myself or (what) I want her to be?' " Williams said. "I worked in finance. I was always strong in certain subjects that she doesn't happen to like all that much. Am I pressuring her too much on math because that's not her thing? She's a dancer. She's a great writer. She's other things."Williams said her daughter recently told her mother that she chews her fingernails because she's a perfectionist."I said 'Well I used to chew my fingernails when I was a kid' and I said 'I stopped doing it. And I also used to be a perfectionist and I've stopped doing that so there's hope for you.' ",Health
Go Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life for ourselves and our children through useful paradigms and best practices. Share your insight at the CNN Parenting Facebook page. (CNN)Without meaning to my wife and I conducted an A-B experiment while disciplining our two children. They are 4½ years apart and somewhere in that gap -- thanks to the suggestions of the progressive mindful parenting books we regularly consume -- we did away with the popular refuge of nearly all parents (probably since the dawn of time): the "timeout." As some Neanderthal dad probably yelled "Go to your part of the cave until you've calmed down!"The arguments for the timeout boil down to: 1. It's better than spanking. (True.) 2. Parents want a little time away from a child's aggravating behavior. (No doubt.) Timeouts have been popular for decades and are still recommended by some parenting experts. But it's time to add the timeout to the parental dust bin of history along with yelling hitting and missing school in order to help run the farm.Here is the fundamental failure of the timeout: It's tantamount to abandoning your kid when they need you most. If they're acting up it may be to get your attention. If they are upset or angry they want you to connect with them (even if they push you away). Your calm listening presence or a long hug -- not isolation -- is what they need to reconnect to their rational brain.These moments just after upsetting behavior and anger -- yours and theirs -- can move a parent-child relationship closer or farther apart.Need some solid social science to convince you? The National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study in 1982 (the timeout method hasn't changed since then) that found kids who had timeouts -- or "love withdrawal" as the study's authors also called the method -- were more misbehaved even when moms in the study talked to their kids after their timeout reflection.Premier parenting academic Alfie Kohn has written extensively about the negative effects on a child's moral and psychological development due to timeouts and other love-withdrawal techniques. He cites child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim who concluded that timeouts can cause "deep feelings of anxiety." And if you're telling yourself a timeout is not a punishment but rather a much-needed break for reflection and self-calming let me ask you: Does your child think it's a punishment? If so then it is.Describing timeouts in their book "How to Talk so Kids Can Learn" Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish write "As an adult you can imagine how resentful and humiliated you would feel if someone forced you into isolation for something you said or did."What's the alternative?I bet most parents who use the timeout -- which seems to work in the short run (perhaps because it triggers a child's fear of abandonment according to developmental psychologist Aletha Solter) -- do so because it's expedient. If we had an alternative that worked more effectively and just as swiftly we'd gladly use it.The answer is "time-ins." That sounds too cute to be real advice but maybe it's just catchy enough that you will remember it when you're driven to the point of anger and not thinking straight yourself. Fight the urge to push your troubled kid away and work to embrace them instead.When you remove the option of distance and solitude you have no choice but to engage. That step by the way is often all it takes to stop the behavior. But you can also help them calm themselves; a few deep breaths is remarkably effective.And then you both can find a solution together as a team instead of in opposition. Listen fully and patiently to their version of the story. And talk about mitigating factors. Are they hungry angry lonely tired stressed or sick (a list that forms the handy acronym HALTSS)? Sometimes there are no solutions. We all just need to be heard sometimes. After you understand where they're coming from try reflecting their feelings back to them. "You feel sad that the playdate has to end." "That's so frustrating when a plan doesn't work out like we hoped."Time-ins demonstrate to them you care even when times get tough. It conveys the message that their "bad" emotions (which are really just difficult yet perfectly natural ones) are as acceptable as their pleasant happy emotions. Time-ins also teach kids to pay closer attention to their feelings and needs and get better at finding solutions to their problems. These moments -- when reflexively a timeout seems the easiest route -- are great parenting opportunities to connect (aka love) and teach life skills. Sometimes especially with older kids they may genuinely want you to go away. But stay close. Maybe refrain from talking. If you leave the room check in after a bit.My wife and I give ourselves timeouts on occasion when we need a break. But sending yourself away is not the same as abandoning them especially if you explain your emotional state before you excuse yourself. You are modeling the fact that everyone needs to give themselves recovery breaks (whether it's 30 seconds or 30 minutes). Your kids may use it as a model for themselves.Experiment: Give up timeouts for a monthI'm guessing you won't be convinced that time-ins are more effective than timeouts unless you give it a try. See what happens when you issue no timeouts for a month. It may be a mess at first but I'm convinced you'll see some significant results within a month.Our home experiment had similar results as the National Institute of Mental Health study. If timeouts were effective our younger child (who never got one) would be a terror. And our older one would have acted out more when we ceased to deploy them. But neither happened. In fact we doubled down and largely did away with punishments altogether. The net result has been less confrontation more cohesion more solutions.Our first daughter is 10 years old and has recently started the tween-age rite of passage of occasionally storming off to her room. Sometimes she adds the slammed door as a kinetic exclamation mark. It's a timeout of a different of color -- one she imposes on herself. But my wife or I will check in after a few minutes and see whether she wants to talk. Sometimes I need to apologize if I'm the one who her upset her. But if she still wants to be by herself we respect that. She knows we're nearby always ready for when she needs a time-in. David G.

(CNN)Every January for the past 20 years I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question "what is the meaning of life?"It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous. This simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9000 participants over age 65 and another among 6000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life whether it was personal (like happiness) creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.The connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress as other research has shown) but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.The reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer I believe only answers that are right for you at any given time. Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle the Greek philosopher who lived 2500 years ago is believed to have written that the essence of life is "to serve others and to do good" and the Roman philosopher Cicero born 280 years later came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy who wrote "The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity." And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added "if you can't help them at least don't hurt them."Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said "The true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit." And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to "throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""Love" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded "The meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer."My favorite answer though is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne who put it "The purpose of life is a life of purpose."Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. "There is not one big cosmic meaning for all" Anaïs Nin wrote in her diary. "There is only the meaning we each give to our life an individual meaning an individual plot like an individual novel a book for each person." I agree which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. "Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry well-known for his book "The Little Prince."Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question "what is the meaning of life?" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life. And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding. In 1997 my answer was "the discovery pursuit and attainment of one's bliss" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later is was to make "the world a better place." In 2002 the year I got engaged it was simply "Love." And the year we conceived our oldest daughter it was the less-romantic "continuation of one's DNA to the next generation." But most years my answer is some combination of love legacy happiness experience and helping others. As a practical matter if you want to do the annual "Meaning" exercise I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper and keep it someplace safe.The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude as Tolstoy and Aristotle did that the meaning of life to help others that should help motivate you to do more of it. If "love" is the answer then love more. If it's "find your bliss" then get searching for it.This is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful and longer life.,Health

As a species we are impressively committed to self-improvement and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.Habits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress. "Habit is a good servant but a bad master" is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book "Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives." Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit" and Jeremy Dean's "Making Habits Breaking Habits." Together they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control how to choose a habit to begin or end and the mechanics of sticking with it. The first thing to know each book explained is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote they are automatic. "All our life ... is but a mass of habits" philosopher and psychologist William James wrote though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40%. Still that's a lot of mindless behavior.It's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks we'd get little else done. The whole trick is to get habits to work for you not against you. Self-control is a limited resource Dean explains so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing. Room to growThe first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.This step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?We know what many of the most common areas of improvement are at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight eat better be more mindful spend money more wisely sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones you can succeed in most of these areas.One helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions research has shown are Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant and Time-bound. Before finishing the first book (Dean's which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based) I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start the other a bad habit to quit.Rubin who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy marriage a medical diagnosis a family death an anniversary a long trip or a new year.Repeal and replace your behaviorThe consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example many people stop smoking by chewing gum. The point is that bad habits die hard and as with riding a bike your brain never stops learning how to do them.So it's easier to think about any habit formation even new "good" ones in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts dried papaya instead of chocolate sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern. To be more mindful with my kids I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.Duhigg explains that habit "reversal therapy" is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder as well as predilections such as gambling smoking and bed-wetting.It's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction however even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking. Dean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: 5 genius morning routine habits as told by 5 of the world's most successful peopleThe wonderful thing about triggersWe like to think we have free will in every situation but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings such as stress or boredom. Being aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?You can help create conditions to avoid triggers but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained maybe going back years it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations you need contingencies. Dean calls them  "If ... then ..." plans. When trigger X happens I won't do bad habit Y as I usually do but I will replace it with much healthier Z action. My favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.You likewise need to have a plan for when a strong perhaps rare trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily I can avoid eating cupcakes at work but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch it's late afternoon I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter? 66 is the magic number According to one study cited by Dean and Rubin it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.I avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as "be more present with my kids" can be numerically self-scored every evening. And another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved or even just aware makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.Treat yo'self: rewardsUnlike tracking and accountability incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit. For me rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system.If you do treat yourself for keeping a habit make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward say avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream. And that's one to grow onAt the end of 66 days I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.The real test though is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying. Rubin would call it "stumbling" and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.You may want to read one of the habit books too. The three overlap and support each other but my personal preference was for Rubin's largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking introspection and applied psychology. She's the author of the bestselling "The Happiness Project" and wrote this new book she explained after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.But I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin whose advice would make all these books unnecessary. " 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them" he wrote.,Health
 (CNN)It's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls children yawn and bedtime routines engage.Yet the places where children sleep the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures. Even differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking as in Venice-based photographer James Mollison's photo series "Where Children Sleep" which has been adapted into a book.Though it has been nearly seven years since the series was published the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to bedtime around the globe.While photographing the series "I met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience rather than a place they can in any sense call their room" Mollison said."I came to appreciate just how privileged I was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow" he said. "I met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys."Here is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.Drastic differences in babies' bedtimesWhile researching children's sleep across the globe clinical psychologist Jodi Mindell was surprised to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.She described the differences as "unbelievable.""When I walked into doing this study I really thought we would see 10- or 15-minute differences" said Mindell a professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and associate director of the Sleep Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.It turned out however "we're seeing these 2½-hour differences between some countries like Australia and New Zealand with other countries like Hong Kong and Korea" she said. "Bedtimes ranged dramatically across cultures."Mindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29287 infants and toddlers up to 3 years old responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes. Those findings were published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2010.The parents were from China Hong Kong India Indonesia Korea Japan Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Taiwan Thailand Vietnam Australia Canada New Zealand the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006 September and December 2007 and April 2008. The researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m. whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m. on average.The study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.Bedtimes also appear to vary across European countries said Sara Harkness a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture Health and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.She was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes."We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact on one occasion our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m." Harkness said."The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed often in their own room" she said. On the other hand "in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya where we did research in the 1970s babies were always in close proximity to caretakers generally their mother or an older sibling and they slept anywhere and any time" she said.Around the world there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.Parents try it all to get babies to sleepIn the United States it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or for older kids a book.Yet around the world bedtime routines involve a different approach and in some places they appear to be less common."One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine for 0-3 some type of feeding whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks and that's consistent across all countries but if we take that out there's big differences in activities like bathing" Mindell said citing her own research.In the US "60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India only 13%. In Indonesia it's only 6%" she said. "They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day."There are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers Mindell added."In the Philippines 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine" she said. "Whereas some place like Australia only 6% did. In Indonesia 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine."Once the time comes to actually get some shut-eye parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.In Korea Harkness said parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland but Dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep."The Dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the 'Three R's' of childrearing -- rust regelmaat en reinheid or 'rest regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age" Harkness said.Who bed-shares and who doesn'tSimilar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices."Co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves. Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room" Harkness said."We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice" she said.In the United States the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says "there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' ""The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance especially from pediatricians about avoiding co-sleeping" Harkness said. "This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation."'Bedtime routines are the perfect package'All in all bedtime routines can benefit a child's development Mindell said."Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep but for promoting positive child development" Mindell said. "Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better but it also promotes things like literacy attachment language bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States" she said.,Health
 (CNN)Singer Halsey performed at Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Holiday Special but she's called out the company on Instagram.The show which aired Sunday was filmed last month in New York City.Comments made by Ed Razek the chief marketing officer for Victoria's Secret's parent company in a November interview with Vogue sparked controversy.Razek was asked about competitive brands "that are putting trans women in their advertisements" and "women who are size 40." Razek responded "If you're asking if we've considered putting a transgender model in the show or looked at putting a plus-size model in the show we have."But it was what he went on to say that did not go over well with some."Shouldn't you have transsexuals in the show? No I don't think we should" Razek said. "Well why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It's a 42-minute entertainment special. That's what it is."The term "transsexuals" is considered out dated and offensive to many in the LGBTQ community.Halsey took to her Instagram account Sunday with a post that seemed aimed at Razek's comments."I have adored the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show since I was young" she wrote in a note posted there. "Performing this year alongside other amazing artists and hard-working models/friends was supposed to be the best night of my year. However after I filmed the performance some comments were made regarding the show that I simply cannot ignore."Halsey who is bisexual added: "As a member of the LGBTQ+ community I have no tolerance for a lack of inclusivity.""Especially not one motivated by stereotype" she wrote. "If you're on my page because you watched my performance tonight please allow me instead to direct your attention to GLSEN: An organization that offers services aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ youth. And with respect to those youth targeted by these comments in a world where they have been made to feel 'other' I have made a sizeable donation in their honor.""If you are a trans person reading this and these comments have made you feel alienated or invalidated please know that you have allies" "The "Without Me" singer added. "We stand in solidarity" Halsey wrote. "And complete and total acceptance is the only 'fantasy' that I support.",Entertainment

New Delhi India (CNN)One day after marrying in a Christian ceremony celebrity power couple Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas were continuing their wedding festivities Sunday evening with a traditional Hindu ceremony.The event was underway at the glitzy Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur in the Rajasthan state of northwestern India.  It was the fourth day of wedding festivities for the Indian actress 36 and the American singer 26 who announced their engagement in August.In a traditional Hindu ceremony garlands of flowers are first exchanged. The bride and groom then take their vows around a holy fire while a priest performs the ceremony which ends with the groom placing vermillion on the bride's forehead. The bride traditionally wears red.On Saturday Jonas posted photos of the couple enjoying the traditional Indian Mehendi ritual where the bride applies henna on her hands as a sign of matrimony.

 (CNN)There was more than met the eye with Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf on the set of "Transformers" back in the day.During an appearance Thursday on "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen" Fox confirmed that she and LaBeouf had an on-set romance.The pair starred in the 2007 film and the 2009 sequel.

 (CNN)"Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle" fell victim to a larger predator -- namely Disney's big-budget reboot of "The Jungle Book." Yet if you admire Rudyard Kipling's source material in its various forms this darker more distinctly British take directed by Andy Serkis --the acting world's King of Motion Capture -- is an intriguingly complementary movie well worth the time.The film's circuitous path to exhibition is a tangled web of vines unto itself with Warner Bros. having reconsidered a major release eventually selling the completed production to Netflix. It's now receiving a fleeting theatrical run in advance of its entry into the streaming jungles.Serkis -- renowned for his work in "The Lord of the Rings" and "Planet of the Apes" trilogies -- has sought to bring a harder-edged more relevant take to the story working with screenwriter Callie Kloves. Dispensing with the cheerful songs this look at the man-cub Mowgli (Rohan Chand ) even incorporates a preservationist message with the encroachment of man seen as a perilous threat to the natural world.The bones of the story remain largely the same but are presented with a bit more bite just as the language and dialogue possesses a certain poetry.Orphaned because the tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) killed his parents -- "breaking the jungle's ancient law" -- the baby Mowgli is rescued by the panther Bagheera (Christian Bale) who leaves him with a pack of wolves. They raise and protect him but his continued presence is contingent on his ability to prove that he can run with them -- a particular challenge as the helpful bear Baloo (Serkis) points out because he's not a wolf.Bagheera believes that Mowgli can only be saved by forcing him to live with his own kind in the man-village but once there he encounters new issues including his interactions with a hunter ("The Americans'" Matthew Rhys) hired to slay the tiger who has been feasting on the villagers' livestock.Mowgli is described as "man and wolf both and neither" and the movie similarly isn't entirely fish nor fowl. The production design for example is both impressively florid and at times a trifle murky just as the animals' slightly anthropomorphized faces -- animated using the actors' expressions as the foundation -- occasionally look a trifle distracting.In some respects "Mowgli" has as much in common with more serious renditions of the Tarzan story as the Disney depiction with singing animals with the boy bringing his human advantages to bear in dealing with the jungle threats that assail him. That includes a reasonably violent climactic sequence that -- parents should be forewarned -- might be too intense for kids expecting to hear "The Bear Necessities" or some facsimile thereof.For all that the operatic nature of the production -- and a splendid that cast that also includes Serkis Naomie Harris and Cate Blanchett -- brings an imprimatur of class to the movie.Because "Mowgli" doesn't neatly fit into the conventional boxes -- a talking-animals movie that's not for kids -- the parties probably weren't wrong to harbor misgivings about its survival prospects. But this is one of those happy occasions where the Netflix model allows a project that might have been lost in the theatrical wilds to find its place in the circle of life albeit on a lower tier of the jungle canopy."Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle" will premiere theatrically in select cities Nov. 29 and on Netflix on Dec. 7.,Entertainment

 (CNN)Having created the blockbuster "Game of Thrones" George R.R. Martin's works are suddenly in high demand. But "Nightflyers" -- a series based on a 1980s Martin novella -- proves a tediously generic haunted-house-in-space odyssey one that Syfy is either (charitably) experimenting with or (more likely) rapidly exhausting by making all 10 episodes available simultaneously with its linear-TV debut.Set in 2093 there's a timely element to the underlying premise of escaping a polluted Earth described as a "dying planet" as a small international crew engages in an expedition to encounter alien life at the solar system's edge aboard a ship known as Nightflyer. Space really is the final frontier.In addition the scientists/explorers are accompanied by a telepath whose services they'll need to make contact but who given the dangers associated with those abilities they don't trust. The high stakes are all set up by an opening sequence that hints of the mayhem to come with the mission psychiatrist (Gretchen Mol) warning "Do not bring the Nightflyer back to Earth!"What follows however is alternately chaotic and generic -- down to the general look of their spacefaring environs -- featuring an assortment of wholly nondescript characters largely squandering the cast.While the murky nature of everyone's motivations should provide an element of suspense because there's so little investment in the personalities at risk -- which include a mysterious captain (David Ajala) the chief engineer (Bryan F. O'Byrne) and an astro-physicist (Eoin Macken) nursing personal wounds -- it's hard to care who will survive the journey.Adapted into a long-forgotten movie 30 years ago "Nightflyers'" shortcomings largely mirror those of "Origin" a strikingly similar sci-fi premise that recently premiered on YouTube. Because the Syfy show essentially joins the story in the middle there's a similar sense of playing catch-up throughout starting with sorting out what an "L-1" level empath can do and exactly why the crew members are so nervous about having one among them. Syfy nevertheless seems determined to make "Nightflyers" feel like an event -- billing it as such leveraging Martin's name to the hilt and airing the episodes over consecutive nights Sunday through Thursday over two weeks coupled with the option to binge them online.The desire to catch lightning in a bottle in the way that "Thrones" did is certainly understandable -- one half expects to see "George R.R. Martin's High School Yearbook" -- but "Nightflyers" merely reinforces that such alchemy is exceedingly rare. And while the two might share literary lineage the new series is at best a pallid pretender."Nightflyers" premieres Dec. 2 at 10 p.m. on Syfy. All 10 episodes will be available at Syfy.com.,Entertainment

"All I do know is as we age the weight of our unsorted baggage becomes heavier ... much heavier" Springsteen went on to say. "With each passing year the price of our refusal to do that sorting rises higher and higher. ... Long ago the defenses I built to withstand the stress of my childhood to save what I had of myself outlived their usefulness and I've become an abuser of their once lifesaving powers. I relied on them wrongly to isolate myself seal my alienation cut me off from life control others and contain my emotions to a damaging degree. Now the bill collector is knocking and his payment will be in tears."Springsteen said that although he has never been hospitalized he thinks maybe he should have been. The second breakdown which he also discussed in his 2016 memoir "Born to Run" was especially crippling."All I remember was feeling really badly and calling for help" he said. "I might have gotten close to that and for brief brief periods of time. It lasted for — I don't know. Looking back on it now I can't say. Was it a couple weeks? Was it a month? Was it longer?

Instead he insists he just didn't think it was worth mentioning to the wider public.

And I hate that side of me."To be fair Mendes isn't very comfortable with any attention on his personal life including his short-lived relationship with model Hailey Baldwin.A month after the pair attended the Met Ball together Baldwin was engaged to fellow singer (and her former boyfriend) Justin Bieber.The pair have since married and Mendes said he bears no ill will.Justin Bieber confirms he is a 'married man'"I texted Hailey 'Congratulations' and I really am happy for them" he said. "She's still one of the f***ing coolest people ever -- she's not just a beautiful person visually but she's one of the most beautiful hearts I've ever met." It's not the first time the "Treat You Better" singer has addressed rumors about his sexual orientation.As the Rolling Stone story noted last Christmas Mendes felt compelled to record a Snapchat story in response to YouTube commenters. "First of all I'm not gay" he said in the social media posting. "Second of all it shouldn't make a difference if I was or wasn't."But far from shutting down the chatter it just amplified it. Mendes said he now finds himself trying to avoid feeding into the talk.He also agonized after he gave former tour mate Taylor Swift permission to post a video of Swift putting glittery eye makeup on his face backstage during her recent "Reputation" tour. "I felt sick" he said. "I was like 'F**k why did I let her post that?' I just fed the fire that I'm terrified of."Mendes said he was ultimately fine with it and revealed that he grew up with 15 female cousins "braiding hair and painting nails.""Maybe I am a little more feminine -- but that's the way it is" he said. "That's why I am me.",Entertainment
 (CNN)"Green Book" can't avoid "Driving Miss Daisy" comparisons and probably doesn't want to as the film -- amid unease about political polarization and racial division -- conspicuously strives to be uplifting and bridge building. To the extent it achieves those objectives credit Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali whose performances bring humanity and dimension to this fact-based road movie despite the predictable nature of its narrative journey."Green Book" owes a more recent and perhaps larger debt to "Hidden Figures" which also filtered early-1960s civil rights through an inspiring true story. Yet while that hit aimed for the stars this one focuses on a smaller more idiosyncratic story that relies almost exclusively on its leads.Director Peter Farrelly -- a name usually associated with screwball comedy -- appears to be an unlikely choice to oversee such an enterprise. The film however tackles its subject matter with a good deal of grace even if the script has its share of knocks and pings especially in the early going.A key footnote involves the deeply personal nature of the project. The screenplay is credited to Nick Vallelonga -- the son of Mortensen's character Tony Vallelonga -- along with Farrelly and Brian Currie and in flipping the "Miss Daisy" formula spends a bit of time spinning its wheels before getting into gear.It's 1962 and Tony -- basically a glorified bouncer at the Copacabana in New York well connected among the shady swells who frequent the joint -- needs a gig to tide him over financially while the club is closed for repairs.Already revealed to be a racist (he throws away glasses used by black repairmen badmouthing them in Italian) Tony is taken aback when an opportunity arises to serve as a driver and bodyguard for Don Shirley (Ali) the brilliant leader of a musical trio. The piano virtuoso has agreed to a tour of the Deep South but his record company fears the dangers that an African American might encounter will require the services of someone with Tony's skill set.Tony reluctantly takes the job and is presented the Green Book a guide to motels and restaurants that accommodate African-American travelers in the South. One needn't be clairvoyant to anticipate that the two men -- as different as they could possibly be with Tony loud and boorish while Don is quiet and genteel -- will bond over the course of their eight-week pre-Christmas trek which separates Tony from his wife (Linda Cardellini) and kids.Tony is a bruiser who loves eating and Mortensen has obligingly layered on pounds "Raging Bull"-style to fill out those undershirts. On screen he wolfs down meals in a manner that becomes one of the film's better running gags.It's easy to wish "Green Book" itself wasn't quite so ham-fisted at times or on-the-nose with its dialogue. But taken on its own terms the movie possesses hard-to-resist warmth in its underlying theme and welcome humor in the mismatched buddy dynamic -- with Don attempting to make Tony less of a philistine while the driver introduces his meticulous boss to deep-fried foods.Obviously positioned as awards bait "Green Book" the movie doesn't rise to that level but the performances by Mortensen (already a two-time Oscar nominee) and Ali (a well-deserved Oscar winner for supporting actor in "Moonlight") won't be easily ignored. (Mortensen's use of a racial epithet during a panel discussion of the film for which he apologized in a way reinforces its timeliness.)"Dignity always prevails" Don tells Tony whose preferred response to a slight is usually to crack heads.It's a reassuring thought especially amid debate over how far we've come as a society in the nearly six decades since the events depicted in the film. Thanks to the hopefulness at the heart of Tony's personal journey the very dignified "Green Book" might indeed come out a winner."Green Book" premieres in limited U.S. release Nov. 16 and expands Nov. 21. It's rated PG-13.,Entertainment
 (CNN)Netflix desperately wants to make its mark on the Oscar race and in Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical "Roma" it has its strongest contender yet. Yet the streaming service -- having roiled the TV business -- appears determined to storm the movie-awards competition in similar fashion which means breaking rules and operating very much on its own terms.Tellingly two of the year's best films "Roma" and "Cold War" come from Netflix and streaming rival Amazon. Moreover the two have a great deal in common: Both are foreign-language period pieces set outside the US which were shot in black and white reflecting the latitude that comes with being relatively unfettered by traditional financial considerations."Roma" looks back at Cuaron's youth in Mexico focusing on the family maid (played by Yalitza Aparicio) that helped raise him. Amazon's "Cold War" presents a bleak love story -- primarily unfolding in Poland during the aftermath of World War II -- from Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski winner of the 2015 foreign-language Oscar for "Ida."Both movies are vying for foreign-language honors -- representing Mexico and Poland respectively -- as well as courting consideration as best picture.Thanks to Cuaron a much-admired eclectic filmmaker whose credits include "Gravity" and the third "Harry Potter" movie "Roma" is perhaps uniquely positioned to overcome hurdles. In a sign of Netflix's high hopes the service has departed from its day-date theatrical/streaming release strategy carving out an exclusive theatrical window for "Roma" which premiered last week in New York and Los Angeles. The film expands to other cities over the next two weekends before landing on Netflix in mid-December.Despite that concession Netflix is maintaining its approach of opting not to release box-office totals in much the way that it refuses to issue viewer data for its TV programming.Although Netflix is remaining tight lipped Deadline citing industry sources estimated strong early returns for "Roma" based in part on sold-out screenings for the few theaters playing it in New York and L.A. Still in a year where the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences flirted with introducing a "popular film" category that means Oscar voters will likely be left guessing at least in part regarding the extent to which "Roma" has connected with audiences.Granted very little about either "Roma" or "Cold War" (which opens Dec. 21) would augur major box-office returns. The two films in fact are practically the definition of projects made without much concern about the tyranny of commercial appeal.By contrast the critical acclaim being showered on Cuaron's film -- a slow spare ultimately deeply moving project -- is obviously a big part of Netflix's battle plan. "Roma" has already garnered overwhelming praise as various critics' groups prepare to weigh in with their annual year-end honors.Netflix has consistently flouted conventions in its assault on the TV business and its norms and accolades have followed. The service amassed the most Emmy nominations of any programmer this year and tied longtime leader HBO in overall wins.The movie business poses its own unique challenges and perhaps even greater skepticism about these streaming upstarts. If Netflix has demonstrated anything however it's a determination to play by its own rules and in an industry where money talks throw money at acquiring credibility and prestige.Those practices will be tested as awards season kicks into full swing. But if they yield dividends the kudos that come to "Roma" won't have been built in a day."Roma" is playing in New York and Los Angeles. It expands to additional cities on Nov. 29 and Dec. 5 and premieres on Netflix on Dec. 14. "Cold War" premieres Dec. 21 in the US. It's rated R.,Entertainment
 (CNN)"My Brilliant Friend" lives up to its adjective creating such a rich exquisitely rendered plunge into mid-20th-century Naples that it's difficult not to get totally sucked into the hardscrabble small-village lives. Shot in Italian after watching six of the eight episodes there's not much to say but "fantastico."Adapted from the bestselling book by Elena Ferrante who worked on the scripts with director Saverio Costanzo and others and produced in concert with European networks the production has done a masterful job of preserving the writer's voice. The real triumph though is in the casting especially the young actresses who play the central characters at different ages.Like the book the story begins by flashing back as Elena now in her 60s is informed that her one-time bosom pal Lila has disappeared. Sounding more resigned than surprised she quickly begins reminiscing about their upbringing when the two were the smartest girls in their class during a time of post-war upheaval and poverty when girls weren't encouraged to study or seek to elevate their station beyond that of their parents.Fearless rebellious and more than a little mysterious Lila (Ludovica Nasti) exhibits a powerful hold over Elena (Elisa Del Genio) inspired a mix of admiration and envy. They reside in a town where there's little ostensible authority and the working people struggle to get by while living in fear of characters like the loan-shark Don Achille who Elena's narration describes as "the ogre of fairy tales."The girls' friendship however grows deeper as they bond by reading "Little Women" together ("It was our book and we loved it dearly") before puberty begins to complicate their lives with Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace taking over the roles.Elena manages to convince her family to let her stay in school while Lila doesn't; nevertheless Lila continues to read and educate herself even as she blossoms into a much-in-demand beauty resisting the advances of the well-to-do boy that's pursuing her.The project's brilliance most often comes in small but illuminating scenes such as the look on the face of Elena's father when he tries introducing her to a wealthy man at his work only to be bluntly dismissed. Ferrante also deals with issues of class and inequality filtered through a period of tumult where turning to communism is among the alternatives.While the lives shown aren't glamorous the meticulous nature of the village makes it a place you want to visit -- whether the passage is booked by travel agent or time machine.HBO has enjoyed a good deal of success with its limited series many of them driven by high-profile stars a la "Big Little Lies." Here the book is the centerpiece and the setting and performances make it possible to escape almost entirely into the sometimes aching sometimes stirring almost invariably beautiful world of "My Brilliant Friend.""My Brilliant Friend" premieres Nov. 18 at 9 p.m. on HBO with the eight episodes airing Sundays and Mondays over four weeks.,Entertainment
New York (CNN)President Trump insulted three reporters affiliated with CNN on Friday and said the White House may continue to take press passes away from members of the media.Trump's unprecedented threat poses a serious challenge to the White House press corps and the association that represents them.The White House suspended CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass on Wednesday night hours after Acosta pressed Trump at a press conference. At a Q&A session on Friday morning when a reporter asked Trump "How long are you going to leave Jim Acosta in the penalty box?" he said "I haven't made that decision but it could be others also."Unprompted Trump brought up April Ryan the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks who doubles as a CNN analyst. "You talk about somebody that's a loser she doesn't know what the hell she's doing" Trump said. "She gets publicity and then she gets a pay raise or she gets a contract with I think CNN." (Ryan has been a regular on CNN for a year and a half.)"But she's very nasty and she shouldn't be. She shouldn't be" Trump said. "You've gotta treat the White House and the office of the presidency with respect."In between his calls for "respect" Trump called Acosta "unprofessional" and disparaged the reporter's intelligence. Trump also cast doubt on the stated rationale for stripping Acosta's credential.  The White House originally claimed that Acosta placed his hands on an intern who tried to take a microphone from him. Press secretary Sarah Sanders called it "inappropriate behavior." The video proved otherwise. CNN said Sanders' explanation a lie. On Friday Trump said of Acosta "He was not nice to that young woman." But then he said "I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly you know horrible." Separately he called out Acosta's tense exchanges with Sanders at past press briefings saying "it's a disgrace" suggesting the retaliation was about more than Wednesday's press conference. CNN has been working behind the scenes on a resolution that would restore Acosta's pass. In the meantime Acosta has continued to report without physical access to the White House grounds; he is currently in Paris to cover Trump's trip to France.A number of prominent journalism advocacy groups have come to Acosta's defense and called for an immediate restoration of his press pass. But some journalists — concerned about which reporter might be targeted next — have been calling for action to match the words. On Friday the Boston Globe's editorial board called for a White House press walkout.Richard Tofel the president of ProPublica tweeted on Friday morning "What is the plan for when Trump concocts an excuse for vetoing a reporter" from the New York Times or Washington Post? "Surely" he wrote "we must realize that if it works with CNN this will just be the first time and not the last."CNN's other White House reporters and producers have been unaffected by the action against Acosta. But in effect the White House is trying to veto Acosta."At every good news organization of which I've been aware over 35 years in and around journalism it has been a bedrock principle that subjects don't get to choose the reporters who cover them which includes not getting to veto reporters they don't like" Tofel wrote. At Friday's Q&A session Trump also had sharp words for CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip.  She asked one of the day's key questions about newly appointed acting attorney general Matt Whitaker: "Do you want him to rein in Robert Mueller?"Instead of answering the question Trump said "What a stupid question you asked. What a stupid question and I watch you a lot and you ask a lot of stupid questions." (Trump has previously said he doesn't watch CNN.)CNN's Dana Bash tweeted this reaction: "Harvard University will be surprised to hear POTUS call one of their graduates — my friend and colleague Abby Phillip - stupid. In fact she asked THE KEY SMART question: does he want his acting AG to mess with Mueller probe — one he calls a witch hunt."Phillip and Ryan are two of a small number of African American women who cover the White House. The president has a long history of insulting the intelligence of women and people of color.Earlier this week Trump snapped at another African American woman Yamiche Alcindor of PBS and accused her of asking a "racist question." Her question was about the widespread concerns that Trump's rhetoric emboldens white nationalists.On Twitter Astead Wesley of The New York Times connected the dots between the different incidents."There are embarrassingly few black and hispanic reporters in the WH press corps and four have been personally insulted by the President this week" he wrote.After Friday morning's Q&A session Ryan called into CNN and said she shook off his insults.A 20-year veteran of the White House beat Ryan pointed out that each president before Trump "understood that reporters were part of the underpinnings of this nation."Trump she said doesn't seem to appreciate that.,Entertainment
 (CNN)Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos didn't have a lot of details to offer on the projects being prepped by Barack and Michelle Obama for his streaming service but indicated that the content won't necessarily be "political." "They want to do storytelling that is fitting with the things [they] have done with the presidency obviously but [also] the experiences they've had throughout their entire lives" Sarandos told the crowd at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit on Tuesday. Sarandos said the content will hit on subjects like sports lifestyle and nutrition. Echoing the information shared in the deal's original announcement Sarandos said the former president and first lady have "got their eyes on film and television fiction and nonfiction."  The Obamas deal with the streaming giant was formally announced back in May. At the time of the announcement the Obamas said in a statement that they were looking forward to harnessing "the power of storytelling" to promote common values.Sources told CNN back in May that the Obamas would possibly be appearing on camera as moderators or hosts. Sarandos said he hoped on-camera appearances were in the cards but said current projects have them serving as executive producers and doing some voice over work. He added that the streaming network would have "a lot to talk about later this year" regarding its slate of Obama projects. ,Entertainment
Hong Kong (CNN Business)"Crazy Rich Asians" is finally getting a run in China's lucrative movie market. The romantic comedy is scheduled to hit theaters in mainland China on November 30 Warner Bros. said Tuesday.  There had been some doubt about whether the movie with a plot that features incredibly rich and privileged Asians would get the go-ahead from China's film regulator. The Chinese government has in recent years frowned on anything that could be interpreted as a celebration of ostentatious wealth. Experts have also questioned whether the film's depiction of high-rolling members of the Chinese diaspora in Singapore would resonate with audiences in mainland China.But Warner Bros. isn't playing down the crazy rich aspect of its movie. The studio announced the movie's Chinese release on social media with the promise of "yachts parties high-end lifestyle!"China's movie regulator typically allows only 34 foreign films to be shown in theaters each year. Scoring one of those coveted slots can significantly boost a movie's global box office returns. Several big budget Hollywood films like "Ready Player One" and "Black Panther" had bigger debuts in China than in North America. "Crazy Rich Asians" has a different title for China that roughly translates as "Tales of Gold Digging." That's at odds with the movie's storyline in which the main character is initially clueless about her Singaporean boyfriend's incredible family wealth. When it came to Hong Kong in late August the title was translated to "My Super Rich Boyfriend."In the United States the movie was lauded for featuring an all-Asian cast at a time when Hollywood has come under fire for its lack of diversity. In China where the majority of films feature all-Asian casts that's much less remarkable. Warner Bros. didn't respond to a request for comment on whether any changes had been made to the film at the request of the Chinese regulator.The makers of "Crazy Rich Asians" had been hoping for a run in the world's second largest movie market. "We're all praying to the China gods right now" producer John Penotti said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in August. "From my colleagues in Beijing it looks like we're in strong consideration." "Crazy Rich Asians" was a late summer hit in the United States and has since released in dozens of countries from Australia to Venezuela. It has made $228 million worldwide so far.

New York (CNN Business)The final season of "Game of Thrones" isn't airing until 2019 but the race is already underway to find the next king of television.Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon and more traditional networks like CBS are spending millions of dollars to find the next series that will fill the giant hole "Game of Thrones" will leave behind. But they all may be chasing something increasingly elusive: a universal hit. When "Game of Thrones" premiered on HBO in 2011 it had far less competition — streaming services weren't as popular as they are today."You're trying to break through the clutter of 500 shows with one great show" Michael Nathanson media analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson told CNN Business. A hit show can lead to more subscribers and clout for the network according to Nathanson."Game of Thrones'" engaging storytelling immersive world and enormous production budget has led to 47 EmmysAmazon is bringing "Lord of the Rings" to the small screen for a reported price tag that could reach $500 million. One of Disney's big bets for its new streaming service is a "Star Wars" series which has a reported budget of roughly $100 million for 10 episodes. Both of those franchises have made billions at the box office but the jury is still out on whether they can find that level of success on TV. All Access CBS' streaming service wants to make a name for itself with a "Twilight Zone" reboot from "Get Out" director Jordan Peele and a "Star Trek" series that has Patrick Stewart returning as Captain Picard. Both are beloved brands that have been around for decades but it's not yet clear if they can court a new generation of fans.And HBO is future-proofing for its life after "Thrones" with its adaptation of Alan Moore's "Watchmen" which is one of the most critically praised graphic novels ever. The cable network is also hoping to stay in the "Game of Thrones" business after the show ends with a prequel based on the series.WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey has said HBO needs to substantially increase its subscriber base by creating more engaging content. (HBO like CNN is owned by WarnerMedia.)"We need hours a day" Stankey said in July about the time viewers spend watching HBO programming according to the New York Times. "You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes."Streaming services are still gunning for that "one signature breakout hit" but they will need a lot more content to keep a global audience engaged according to Nathanson.But volume alone isn't enough. Stankey's boss AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has implied that prestige is an important factor for success. He knocked Netflix by comparing it to Walmart while comparing HBO to Tiffany's.Jill Rosengard Hill an executive vice president at Magid a research-based media firm told CNN Business that the future of subscription TV will probably be a mix of quality and quantity."Streaming services need volume with both diverse originals and a large library of acquired shows and movies to give the consumer more bang for their subscription bucks" she said.Sonia Saraiya TV critic at Vanity Fair believes that HBO's "Watchmen" may have the best shot at being the next big thing because it's helmed by Damon Lindelof who has proven to be a good storyteller. He was a co-creator of "Lost" and already has "really successful source material." "My guess is that what makes something be the next 'Game of Thrones' is something that really goes in a totally different direction" Saraiya said. "Like something that isn't trying to recreate that success but something that is going for a very clear and unique vision.",Entertainment
