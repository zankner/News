Chico California (CNN)First they were driven from their homes by the deadly Camp Fire in Northern California. Now if it rains they could be flooded out of their tent city which has sprung up in a Walmart parking lot.That possibility of flooding from rain is one concern that has authorities working to relocate the estimated hundreds of wildfire evacuees who have taken refuge at the parking lot 10 minutes down the hill from the town of Paradise which is now little more than acres of charred ruins.As thousands of people packed into shelters in Butte County after their homes were destroyed many others were left without a place to go. The Walmart in Chico was where many Paradise residents shopped a familiar place where they felt safe and comfortable. So they slept there in tents and cars.What started as a temporary shelter for those escaping the fire has turned into a makeshift village. Volunteers have been stationed at the parking lot handing out everything from smoke masks to dog food to clothes and other essentials.There are several portable toilets on site although people have to go elsewhere to shower. A whiteboard on site tells people where else they can go to find shelter and lists names of those missing from the fire. A poster provides information about free available shuttles discount codes for Lyft rides and the number to call if longer rides are needed. Alex Hader co-owner of the Sexy Panda food truck based in Sacramento came to the parking lot with co-owner Kristina Wheeler last Friday and the two have been there ever since. The truck is open 24/7 offering breakfast burritos burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches for free to anyone who needs food at any hour. "We didn't plan on being out here this long" Hader said. "We didn't plan on it turning into something like this either. We just got the thought in our head to come out here and feed some people that need it." They say their experience at the tent city has been life-changing. "There's so many people out here that are just broken right now and the way everybody's coming together with all the donations" Wheeler said. "Even the people who are affected by the fire directly they're helping. They're donating."Though donations from the community have poured in and volunteers have come from all over local organizers recognize that the tent city wasn't meant to last. "It was always a short-term solution" Rob Busick one of the grassroots organizers of the volunteer efforts told CNN. "A lot of people didn't have anything as they came down here so our immediate need was just to care and show compassion for these people."Temperatures in Chico are set to get cooler this week and weather forecasts call for rain. The tent city is susceptible to flooding since it's at the bottom of a hill so organizers say it's important that people sheltering there relocate. "I know that losing what they've lost and also transitioning into a parking lot and doing it again is a difficult conversation but the health and safety of them has been No. 1 since Day One" Busick said.Butte County officials announced they were working with the city of Chico the American Red Cross and volunteers to move evacuees in the tent city to an open shelter at Butte County Fairgrounds in Gridley. The county will provide transportation to the new shelter starting Saturday and the shelter will begin taking in small animals Sunday according to a news release. Both Butte County and Walmart said rumors that people would be kicked out of the tent city on Sunday were untrue. A county spokesperson said the relocation efforts are because of health safety and weather concerns."Our priority is making sure we get fire-displaced residents into a place where they'll be protected from the weather elements where services are available and making sure they're connected to services" the spokesperson said.Those services include ongoing updates about the fire and recovery efforts as well as basic needs such as toilets showers and food.Finding available shelter space has been a challenge for the county. According to its website one more shelter in addition to the one in Gridley is open and accepting evacuees. But five others are either full or not taking in any more people because of a norovirus outbreak. The Camp Fire has destroyed about 9800 homes according to the latest estimate from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection also known as Cal Fire. CNN's Meridith Edwards and Kaylee Hartung reported from Chico and Harmeet Kaur reported and wrote from New York. CNN's Shawn Nottingham and Monte Plott contributed to this report.,U.S.

 (CNN)While hundreds of families wait in agony to learn the fate of missing loved ones officials gave a gut-wrenching forecast on the fate of California's Camp Fire: It's not even halfway done burning yet. Since the Camp Fire erupted 10 days ago it has killed 76 people destroyed more than 9700 homes and torched an area the size of Chicago. But the blaze probably won't be fully contained until November 30 according to Cal Fire the state's forestry and fire protection agency."It is overwhelming I don't have any word to describe it" Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said. "This is unprecedented. No one has had to deal with this magnitude that caused so much destruction and regrettably so much death."The Camp Fire is already the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. And with more than 1200 people still unaccounted for officials fear the death toll could keep rising. Crews are combing the remnants of houses where all evidence of life has been wiped out by flames. Many of the searchers have lost their own homes and are looking for the remains of their neighbors.While the search for the dead and missing continues thousands of firefighters are trying to control the blaze. As of Sunday morning the Camp Fire had seared 149500 acres and was 60% contained. 'People don't know that we're looking for them'Though the number of people missing from the Camp Fire has skyrocketed it's hard to tell exactly how many are lost and how many may be safe elsewhere officials said."That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls emails and the 911 system" Honea said. "It's not perfect data but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection we're trying to get some progress going."Hundreds of deputies National Guard troops coroners and anthropologists are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains. "There are a lot of people displaced and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them" the sheriff said.Butte County is maintaining a list of people reported missing from the Camp Fire. Honea urged anyone who sees their own name or the name of a loved one found safe to contact the sheriff's office. 'We're not the only family that's going through this'Sadia Quint has no idea what happened to her uncle David William Marbury who lived in a house in the largely obliterated town of Paradise. "We already know that his house has been burned down and his car was in his garage" Quint said. "So now we're just waiting for the sheriff's department to go out there and let us know if his body's in there or not."Her family has provided DNA samples in case authorities find Marbury's remains. "We're being patient just because we know we're not the only family that's going through this right now" Quint said. "So everyone's kind of in it together and everyone's being really supportive."But as the hours pass with no news on her uncle Quint said she's prepared for the worst. "He had respiratory issues and he had back problems" Quint said. "It's hard to think about him not being here anymore. But as a family we have accepted whether we get good or bad news. So we're just prepared for both."Escaping through ditches front yardsThe harrowing escape from fast-moving flames still haunt Dan Newman. As a Butte County search-and-rescue team captain Newman was originally tasked with going door to door to alert people in the community of Concow to the fire.The mission quickly shifted to Paradise about a 20-mile drive away where a hospital was in dire trouble."When we arrived at the hospital there were already flames" he said. "And all of a sudden the urgency just skyrocketed." Newman's team went around to the ER entrance and threw four patients in its truck.The hospital evacuation involved every kind of vehicle -- ambulances police cars buses and personal cars. The road that went by the hospital was swamped with cars and accidents. Drivers used every bit of open space they could to escape racing through ditches and front yards Newman said.The fire was moving faster than any vehicle could he said."We had homes on fire on each side" he said. Newman's team managed to get out but another team couldn't and ended up back at the hospital.Southern California blaze kills 3 peopleAcross the state the deadly Woolsey Fire is still wreaking havoc in Southern California. At least three people have been killed and more than 96000 acres have been torched by the Woolsey Fire Cal Fire said. Impact Your World: How you can help the fire victimsBut a few bits of good news emerged Sunday. The Woolsey Fire is now 88% contained and all of Ventura County is now open -- meaning more residents can return and try to start rebuilding their lives.  ,U.S.
 (CNN)When Margaret Newsum saw the news that the Camp Fire was not far from her home the 93-year-old knew she'd have to evacuate.But her caregiver wasn't around that morning to take her. And when Newsum went to call for help her electricity shut off and phone service went down.So she got her medicine and other vital needs together and walked out of her home in Magalia California hoping somebody would come by and help her. Salvation soon came in the form of a garbage truck."I was standing there when I looked up and saw this great big green monster truck barreling down the street" Newsum told CNN.Around that time Dane Ray Cummings a Waste Management driver had been told to cut his trash collection route short and head home as the Camp Fire neared. But he wanted to finish his route and he had a mind to check on some houses with elderly or disabled residents.Cummings drove up to find Newsum waiting for him. And once he realized she needed to evacuate he knew what he had to do."He said you're going with me" Newsum recalled.Cummings' rescue of Newsum is just one of a number of tales of citizens helping others out during the California wildfires that have killed at least 74 people statewide. The Camp Fire the deadliest wildfire in state history has destroyed most of Paradise a town near Magalia causing widespread evacuations and smog across Northern California.A long journey to safetyThe fire stopped before it reached Newsum's home but she and Cummings didn't know that at the time. Newsum recently broke her back and uses a walker to get around which made it tricky to get up into the cab of his garbage truck. Cummings and some neighbors lifted her up and buckled her in and they strapped her walker to the side of the truck.With thousands trying to flee at the same time the trip was slow going they said."He got in the truck and away we went. It was stop go stop go" Newsum said. "We were on the road about 5½ hours. When we started coming down out of the hill the smoke was so bad it was like going into the bowels of hell. It was so black. I've never seen smoke that black before. It was frightening."On the ride Cummings called up childhood friend and co-worker Brian Harrison a heavy equipment technician for Waste Management."He says 'Brian you are not gonna believe what I have in my truck' " Harrison told CNN.They weren't sure what to do with Newsum but Harrison knew an evacuation center was no place for a 93-year-old."I said Dane 'This is a no-brainer. I'm just gonna take her home' " he said. "It's just the right thing to do."Harrison a single dad said his sister and his children have chipped in to help take care of Newsum for the past week -- not that she needs too much help."She's the most independent 93-year-old you'll ever meet" he said. For her part Newsum who has no family in the area was incredibly thankful for the care she's received."This family has taken me in. I have never felt so wanted and so comfortable and so much brought into making me part of the family" she said.Harrison recently learned it might be a couple of months before Newsum's allowed back into her home news he said that excited his kids."They've grown to love her. They just want to keep her" he said.Or as Newsum put it "I'm like a stray puppy the kids fell in love with.",U.S.
Major wildfires in California have destroyed a record number of buildings and displaced more than 300000 people.In Northern California residents have been forced to evacuate parts of Butte County after the deadly Camp Fire broke out Thursday November 8 and burned through the town of Paradise. It's the most destructive wildfire in California history and the deadliest. The Woolsey Fire began on the same day in Southern California and in a matter of hours it grew thousands of acres in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.The Hill Fire also sprung up in Ventura County near the bar in Thousand Oaks where 12 people were killed November 7 in a mass shooting.,U.S.
 (CNN)A man says he's sorry for causing a commotion in a Baltimore theater last week by yelling "Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!" during a performance of "Fiddler on the Roof." "I opened my mouth and it was so wrong. I know that now" the man told CNN affiliate WBAL. "I don't know what I was thinking. I'm so ashamed."The man identified in a police incident report as Anthony M. Derlunas 58 told WBAL and the Sun that he's actually anti-Trump and anti-hate.He told the Sun that the musical reminded him of Trump's immigration policies. His comparison "came out wrong" and was "beyond a mistake" he told the newspaper.The outburst comes at a time of a dramatic spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and follows last month's Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in which a gunman killed 11 worshippers. "Fiddler on the Roof" is an award-winning musical based on the "Tevye" stories by Sholem Aleichem about a Jewish family facing persecution in Tsarist Russia. The incident happened Wednesday night about 10 minutes into the first intermission at Baltimore's Hippodrome Theatre audience members told CNN. The final scene before intermission reminded the man of his hatred for Trump according to a police report of the incident and he then stood up to yell "Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!"Rich Scherr a contributor for The Baltimore Sun witnessed the man who was seated in the upper balcony shouting the pro-Nazi salute."Several people in the audience began running toward the exits" Scherr told CNN. "I personally thought I was about to hear gunshots."Scherr who later posted a video from the incident on Facebook and Twitter said the man went on to shout other things before security took him out. The show resumed 10 minutes later.It is not possible to discern what the man was saying from the video which shows audience members' apparently concerned reactions.Samit Verma a journalist at Voice of America was seated in the balcony on the right side of the theater with his wife when he heard the man shouting."I initially could not make out what the man was saying but as more people exited the main theater I could clearly see him making a Hitler salute and yelling 'Heil Hitler!' " Verma told CNN. "Everyone around me appeared quite shaken by the experience and some people were in tears."Another audience member Heather O'Hare said everyone was shuffling and getting up to go to the restroom during the intermission when she heard the disturbance. "People in the front orchestra seats started to turn and look up at the balcony and someone started shouting back: 'Go Home Nazi!' " she said. "We were kind (of) confused and numb about what actually was happening but several audience members were palpably upset and decided to leave during the intermission break. The entire right half of the row in front of me was gone after Act One."'Many Jewish families ... were visibly shaken' Kasey Chisholm was in the lobby with her father during intermission when the outburst occurred. She saw security swarm in and escort the man out."We found out what he had been yelling when we returned to our seats" she said. "Many Jewish families were around our seats and were visibly shaken." Connor Drew was also in the lobby at the time. When he returned to his seat he said he saw a woman next to him "shaking while on the phone with her son."In a statement released to CNN affiliate WJZ the Hippodrome Theatre said "Behavior like we saw during intermission at Wednesday evening's performance is not and will not be tolerated."The Hippodrome's on-site security team along with our usher staff were able to remedy the situation and remove the offending audience member quickly coordinating efforts with local police who met the man as he was escorted out of the building."Police found Derlunas standing outside the theater "in a calm manner" with a female companion according to the police incident report. Officers spoke with the two and they were allowed to leave the area.CNN's David Williams contributed to this report. ,U.S.
 (CNN)Sadia Quint has every indication her uncle has perished in the Camp Fire. But no one can tell her for sure. "We already know that his house has been burned down and his car was in his garage" she said. "So now we're just waiting for the sheriff's department to go out there and let us know if his body's in there or not." Like hundreds of families Quint fluctuates between holding out hope and resigning to the notion that her loved one is gone. In the decimated California town of Paradise where her uncle David William Marbury lived the odds of survival seem bleak. At least 1300 people remain unaccounted for since the Camp Fire started its deadly rampage across Northern California 10 days ago. The inferno is still raging out of control as sheriff's deputies National Guard members and coroners sift through rubble. "We're being patient just because we know we're not the only family that's going through this right now" Quint told CNN. "So everyone's kind of in it together and everyone's being really supportive."The Camp Fire has already killed 76 people though many of the victims haven't been identified. Some remains are charred beyond recognition. So Quint's family has embarked on the grim task of providing DNA samples in case authorities find Marbury's remains.It's not clear when Quint will learn the fate of her uncle but she's already referring to him in the past tense. "He had respiratory issues and he had back problems and he was 66" she said. "I mean it's hard to think about him not being here anymore. But as a family we have accepted whether we get good or bad news. So we're just prepared for both.",U.S.
 (CNN)When a house of worship is attacked -- when it becomes a crime scene stained with blood -- how do you move forward? How do you come back to worship and make it a safe holy place again? How do you support your congregation as it reels from the loss?The Rev. Eric Manning and the Rev. Frank Pomeroy were both forced to face these questions when gunmen stormed their sanctuaries. On June 17 2015 Dylann Roof a self-described white supremacist killed nine members of Charleston South Carolina's historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church including the then-pastor during a Bible study session. Roof was sentenced to death in January 2017. Nine months later Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs Texas on November 5 2017 -- the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. Kelley took his life afterward. In the aftermath of the shootings at their sanctuaries Manning and Pomeroy have embraced the role of being shepherds to their congregations -- exercising patience as members push through their grief attending a murder trial and facilitating discussions around difficult decisions like what to do with the sanctuary. Now rabbis at the Tree of Life synagogue find themselves in a similar position after a gunman killed 11 worshipers last month in Pittsburgh. Manning and Pomeroy shared with CNN some of what they learned as they helped their flocks heal.  'Don't let evil win even for a bit'Pomeroy 52 was traveling with his wife on the morning of the attack on First Baptist Church. A guest pastor preached the day's message. Pomeroy's daughter Annabelle -- a 14-year-old who loved the color purple so much it covered the walls and carpet of her room -- was killed. To begin with Pomeroy said religious leaders must make sure to focus on God and on the people around them."Even prior to the tragedy you've got to make sure your church is focused on Christ something bigger than yourself. So that in the aftermath you're not trying to run under your own power or focus on the things that are just about you" he said."As long as you're already focused on something greater than yourself or focused on others then in the aftermath you'll be able to do the same. You'll already have the habit of focusing on others through Christ."He recalls being "somewhat in a fog" for the first few weeks after the shooting but said it is important to focus on the survivors. He tried to remind them they were not alone he said.  "My immediate attention would be to focus on the lives first of the survivors and the family of the victims and then the rest of the body as a whole" Pomeroy said. Seven days after the shooting Sutherland Springs held service again this time in a community center next to the church."As a body we felt like if we had skipped Sundays or closed the church then evil won -- even for a little bit" Pomeroy said.He said he can't say whether he was coherent then. He went through the motions relying on "muscle memory" he said. "The words just came forth" he said. 'There is no magical date' Mother Emanuel Church was an active crime scene; it had to be returned to a house of worship before the church held service again four days after the fatal shooting. "After it is released they never clean it they never turn it back to the way that it was before. So then you have to go through the process of having professionals come in to clean it" said Manning 50. And that was hard said Manning who was handpicked to shepherd the congregation a year after the shooting. "Even though the cleaning crew did come in they were never able to remove all the bullet strikes on the floor" he said. Manning said it's important to be "mindful that though there may be a push to get the sanctuary the mosque or the synagogue reopened don't rush it." He said members of the congregation may have different feelings on when to hold service again.Days after the shooting in Pittsburgh Manning flew there to meet and offer comfort to Rabbi Jeffrey Myers who lost several members of his congregation."I've been there" Manning said.Both Manning and Pomeroy said the congregation as a whole should decide whether to leave the house of worship and when to return."There's no magical day. There's no magical date" for that decision to be made Manning said.  Manning said Emanuel's leaders rededicated the lower level where the shooting took place to God in April 2017 "in a quiet prayer ceremony of anointing" "Now people may say that really doesn't do anything. But from a spiritual perspective it does" he said.The congregation discussed remodeling the room where the shooting took place but decided against it Manning said. He agreed.  "I don't want anyone to forget the price that was paid and what happened here" he said. Immediately after the shooting First Baptist turned its sanctuary into a memorial. A new sanctuary is being built behind the memorial while the church holds service in modular buildings Pomeroy said."That ground will always be hallowed ground whether we leave the sanctuary there whether it becomes a garden or whatever it may be" Pomeroy said. "The church is within the people; it's just concrete wood and shingles to me."Pomeroy said North American Mission Board which performs missionary outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention and establishes churches offered to build a new church.At some point the congregation will have to decide what to do with the old sanctuary in the long-term Pomeroy said. Be a shepherd Manning said part of his role was to be a shepherd through Roof's trial. In the courtroom he prayed for families of victims and wrote prayers for those testifying. But he didn't shoulder the burden alone.A team of pastors prayed with Manning reflected on scripture and sang songs of praise before the trial he said. "That helped immensely because you were renewed every day and your mind was renewed every day" Manning said.He used sermons to address issues uncovered during the trial because it seemed the only way to address them was through scripture. "At times people would say through those sermons that I preached or in that time period they got the feeling I was ministering to myself" Manning recalled. Remember that everyone grieves differentlyBoth leaders say it's important to not rush their congregation's healing -- to be patient with them and sit with them when needed. Pomeroy said he has encouraged survivors to seek professional therapy and counseling. "As a body coming together and just trusting the Lord to bring this to be" helps with the healing too he said. "It all comes down to whether or not we're letting God work in our hearts and our lives" he said. He said it's also important to remember that everyone mourns at their own pace; there are times when he feels he's past the darkest days of his grief while his wife Sherri is still struggling."Even though we're in the same house been married 32 years we're just different people" he said.  "Every person grieves a little differently." "I'll just try to be there to listen as we go" he said.On the one-year anniversary earlier this month Pomeroy read off the names of victims. It was "probably one of the most difficult things I've ever done" he said.  But in the end he said it was very healing for everyone.,U.S.
 (CNN)More than a week into three California fires authorities are painstakingly searching for missing people and remains in ravaged neighborhoods.Hundreds are reported missing and dozens confirmed dead. Here are questions and answers about the search process. Are all the people actually missing?That isn't clear. Authorities are working from a list of people whose loved ones have called in "welfare checks" or reported them missing Butte County Sheriff's Investigations Sgt. Steve Collins said. After a call officers go out to see if the home or other structure is still standing or if the caller has heard from the missing person since. The process is made more difficult Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said by communications difficulties. "There are a lot of people displaced (who) don't know we are looking for them" Honea said.If people find their own or loved ones' names on the list at the Butte County Sheriff's Office's website they should call the sheriff's office Honea said.Are the people unaccounted for mostly seniors?The list of the missing includes people of all ages. But it also has a lot of seniors with one as old as 101. The hardest-hit town of Paradise has 27000 residents many of them retirees. An initial report showed almost all the homes were destroyed. "I've never been to an incident with this much destruction and the complexity that's tied to it" says Dave Russell of Cal Fire the state's forestry and fire protection agency.Do officials have a firm death toll?The number of fatalities from the fires has gone up almost daily. Many factors make it difficult for officials to reach a firm death toll. One according to Collins is simply that so much area remains to search."It's the number of homes the number of trailers the multistory buildings" Collins said. "All of that changes the complexity of this operation."And once authorities know they have found human remains they reach another obstacle identifying the victims. Honea has invited relatives of the missing to visit the sheriff's office in Oroville so authorities can collect DNA samples to help identify victims.How do they know who to look for?The chaos left by the deadliest fire in California history makes it especially difficult to account for the huge populations affected. Authorities will return to places they have searched to access new locations and to be as thorough as possible. "We are going to continue searching because there are a lot of people that want some answers" Collins said. "They are depending on us to find their loved one."CNN's Hollie Silverman Nicole Chavez and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.,U.S.
 (CNN)The task is painstaking and painful. A searcher is given the name of someone who is unaccounted for and an address.A team heads over to the property more than likely one where every evidence of life has been wiped out by flames. Many of the searchers are local and have lost their own homes. Now they look to see whether they can find the remains of their neighbors.Five more sets of remains were found Saturday Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said. There are now at least 76 dead from the Camp Fire which has obliterated more structures and lives than any previous fire in California.Almost all of the town of Paradise is gone. President Donald Trump witnessed the devastation for himself Saturday accompanied by Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom."We're all going to work together and we'll do a real job but this is very sad to see" Trump said.A list of people unaccounted for has almost 1300 names on it. Officials hope they find those people at shelters or that missing people were simply without phone service and will eventually call in or that they will figure out duplicate names when reconciling the list. They are also trying to help thousands of people who did make it out alive but have nowhere to go except for the parking lot of a Walmart and other places that are hosting thousands in their vehicles and tents."It is overwhelming I don't have any word to describe it" Honea told CNN on Saturday. "This is unprecedented. No one has had to deal with this magnitude that caused so much destruction and regrettably so much death."The deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history the Camp Fire has destroyed more than 9800 homes and scorched 149000 acres since starting November 8. It was 55% contained as of Saturday evening. Meanwhile three deaths have been reported in the Woolsey Fire in Southern California bringing the statewide death toll from the wildfires to 79.'A lot of people don't know ... we're looking for them'Even as the list of those missing in the Camp Fire has ballooned it's hard to tell exactly how many people truly are lost officials have said."That is raw data we're collecting from phone calls emails and the 911 system" Honea said Saturday. "It's not perfect data but our thought process is that it's better to get that information out to help start getting people accounted for. So rather than wait for perfection we're trying to get some progress going."Hundreds of deputies National Guard troops coroners and anthropologists are sifting through leveled homes and mangled cars for remains. While the focus is on the homes of people reported missing some teams are going down streets from one property to the next."I want you to understand that there are a lot of people displaced and we're finding that a lot of people don't know that we're looking for them" the sheriff said.If people find their own or loved ones' names on the list at the Butte County Sheriff's Office's website they should call the sheriff's office Honea said. In the midst of despair hope remains. The mayor of Paradise told CNN Saturday that she is committed to rebuilding her town as is the town council."Paradise is not gone" Jody Jones said citing a friend's Facebook post. "It's just closed for remodeling."Some heroes drive garbage trucksMargaret Newsum gathered her medicine and other vital supplies and went outside her home in Magalia as the Camp Fire roared toward her home. She had no phone service and no electricity and she was just hoping someone would see her and come help. Her rescue came in the form of a big green garbage truck and driver Dane Ray Cummings."He said you're going with me" Newsum 93 recalled.Newsum recently broke her back and uses a walker to get around which made it tricky to get up into the cab of his garbage truck. Cummings and some neighbors lifted her up and buckled her in and they strapped her walker to the side of the truck.Harrison a single father decided Newsum shouldn't go to an evacuation center so instead he took her home with him.And she'll be there a while. Newsum's home wasn't destroyed but it might be months before she can live there again.Escape took them through ditches front yardsWith each day another story comes that makes it clearer how chaotic it was on the flame-filled and smoky day that the fire erupted.Dan Newman a team captain with the Butte County Sheriff's search and rescue team said he originally was tasked with going door to door to alert people in the community of Concow to the fire.The mission quickly changed to go to Paradise about a 20-mile drive away where a hospital was in danger."When we arrived at the hospital there were already flames and all of a sudden the urgency just skyrocketed" he said.His team went around to the ER entrance and threw four patients in its truck.A hospital evacuation involved every kind of vehicle -- ambulances police cars buses personal cars.

Unsung Californians reached out with acts of kindness and generosity.Here are some of their stories.'I just thought they needed to eat'As the entire community of Agoura Hills was forced to evacuate Marco Gonzalez stayed behind -- after authorities gave him permission. Gonzalez and a handful of his staff at Tavern 101 Grill & Tap House started cooking meals for emergency personnel."I told my people I told them I wanted to open just to be here for police firefighters and first responders" Gonzalez said. "We weren't able to get any deliveries into the restaurant so I'll go out and buy whatever I can."Gonzalez's sister-in-law Lyndsay McDougal Cannon began a Venmo page for donations that raised more than $45000 in less than three days."I just thought they needed to eat" Gonzalez said. "(Some firefighters) go for days without having a warm meal. ... What they're doing is putting themselves in harm's way and we have to do whatever we can to help."Waste Management employees help 93-year-oldMargaret Newsum 93 knew she needed to evacuate so she collected her medicines and other vital needs and walked out of her home in Magalia. She didn't know who would take care of her."I was standing there when I looked up and saw this great big green monster truck barreling down the street" Newsum told CNN.Dane Ray Cummings a Waste Management driver was wrapping up his collection route and wanted to check on elderly or disabled residents."He said you're going with me" Newsum recalled.Knowing a 93-year-old shouldn't stay at an evacuation center Cummings called up childhood friend and co-worker Brian Harrison a heavy equipment technician for Waste Management. Harrison agreed to put up Newsum until she can move back into her home."This family has taken me in" Newsum said. "I have never felt so wanted and so comfortable and so much brought into making me part of the family" she said.San Francisco company delivers 5000 mealsChoicelunch is a San Francisco-based company that contracts with schools that don't have the infrastructure or staff to provide their students with lunch. But Friday schools were closed because of air quality and the company was left with 5000 ready-to-eat lunches. Normally the company would take the food to one of their local food banks.Patrick Doral one of the truck drivers left Hayward California and drove north with a respirator and refrigerated truck full of meals.He tried to drop them off at a Walmart in Chico where thousands of people were camping out in tents. But disaster relief coordinators there were unable to take all that food Doral said. Company logistics manager Amanda Putzke contacted a police officer in Sacramento that she saw on the news and he told her to send Doral to a donation site at the Hope Center in Oroville. The Hope Center was able to take the meals and gave them to people in need."I'm glad we were able to help some people out" Doral said. "It's close to the holidays and a lot of people lost everything they have and they just have each other."One lucky horseJeff Hill evacuated Paradise during the Camp Fire but returned to his neighborhood to discover a wayward horse in a backyard swimming pool. It looked like the horse jumped in to escape the flames and became caught in the pool cover."We scrambled to unhook the pool cover and pulled her to the shallow end where we guided her up the steps" Hill wrote in a Facebook post. The horse got out shook off and "loved on us for a few minutes as a thank you and walked off" he wrote.Hill called for help and waited with the horse until resources could escort the horse out from the fire zone.'Burger girl' to the rescueTracy Grant was in a parking lot handing out hamburgers to Camp Fire evacuees when she encountered Lee Brundige a 93-year-old World War II vet who'd just fled his home in Paradise."He called me the burger girl" Grant says.Brundige slept in his car the first night but the following day he had to move because of spreading smoke. Grant persuaded him to move in with her her boyfriend Josh Fox and their two dogs Axle and Cash. It's not clear when Brundige can go home."We found he has many friends and is loved by his community" Grant says. "He can stay with us as long as he would like."First responders lost homes still reported for dutyMany first responders have gone the extra mile. The story of Leland Ratcliff captain of the US Forest Service's Feather River Hotshot crew is emblematic. He was one of more than 50 firefighters who lost their homes in Butte County but kept battling the fires.Ratcliff said he saw the smoke over Paradise on November 8 and quickly realized the fire was on a rapid path to destroy the town. He and his wife evacuated with their two children dog and cat. Once they were safe Ratcliff said he had to make a decision: "Do I go try to save other stuff (from our house) or do I go to try to let people know what was going on?"He chose the latter evacuating residents from their houses and plucking them from the streets putting them on Forest Service vehicles and racing them to points of protection. Later he thought about losing things inside his house like his wedding photos."The guilt doesn't come until afterwards when you realize you don't have that stuff anymore. ... You always want to think that life is more important than property but it doesn't make it any easier in hindsight" he said.CNN's Melissa Gray Dakin Andone Eric Leverson Amanda Jackson Gianluca Mezzofiore Christina Maxouris and Stephanie Becker contributed to this report.,U.S.
Washington (CNN)Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the new Democratic representative-elect from New York seized on a social media smear to show she's not afraid to call out sexism or define herself on her own terms.The incoming lawmaker responded Thursday evening after a journalist referred to her as "a girl" in a tweet critical of her clothing with the message "Dark hates light - that's why you tune it out."Her words came in response to a now-deleted tweet from Eddie Scarry a media reporter for The Washington Examiner in which he posted a photo of Ocasio-Cortez walking down a hallway alongside a caption that read "Hill staffer sent me this pic of Ocasio-Cortez they took just now. I'll tell you something: that jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles." The tweet was quickly and widely criticized on Twitter including by other journalists as sexist and inappropriate. It comes after Ocasio-Cortez suggested in a recent interview with The New York Times that it would be challenging to afford an apartment in Washington before her congressional salary kicks in. Ocasio-Cortez a 29-year-old and member of the Democratic Socialists of America made headlines and sent shockwaves through Washington over the summer when she defeated veteran Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary challenge. While she hasn't officially started her term as a US representative from New York Ocasio-Cortez has already become a focal point of attention on Capitol Hill -- and a target of criticism.Her response reflects both the scrutiny directed at her and her comfort using social media to take it on.In response to the tweet scrutinizing her clothing Ocasio-Cortez wrote "If I walked into Congress wearing a sack they would laugh & take a picture of my backside. If I walk in with my best sale-rack clothes they laugh & take a picture of my backside. Dark hates light - that's why you tune it out. Shine bright & keep it pushing." She wrote in a follow-up tweet "Oh does @eScarry think he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don't think so. You're a journalist - readers should know your bias." Earlier in the week Ocasio-Cortez joined up with activists pushing for action on climate change on Tuesday staging a sit-in at House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's Capitol Hill office.Scarry later posted a follow-up tweet of his own writing that the tweet had been "taken as something else" leading him to delete it. He did not apologize."ATTN! I posted a tweet earlier suggesting the incoming congresswoman looked well put together -- ELEGANT even -- despite suggestions she's struggled. The tweet was taken as something else so I've deleted it!" he tweeted.On Friday afternoon Ocasio-Cortez outlined a broader critique of recent media coverage focused on her specifically citing Fox News and The Washington Examiner."The reason journos from @FoxNews to @dcexaminer can't help but obsess about my clothes rent or mischaracterize respectful convos as "fights" is bc as I've said women like me aren't supposed to run for office - or win. & that's exactly why the BX and Queens sent me here" she wrote.In the tweet Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be at least in part referencing a story published by Politico on Thursday with the headline: "Ocasio-Cortez gets in closed-door fight with veteran lawmaker over climate change." After the story's publication Ocasio-Cortez pushed back tweeting: "This is completely false" in response to a tweet about the story which claimed she clashed with incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone over climate change. ,U.S.
Tallahassee Florida (CNN)A federal courthouse is rarely a place for "Star Trek" references. But Chief US District Judge Mark Walker isn't a normal jurist.Walker a colorful and relaxed judge who was nominated to his post by President Barack Obama in 2012 now finds himself at the center of Florida's election recount hearing at least eight cases on the matter.In a quiet monotone courthouse not known for abundant color he stands out.RELATED: Florida's Senate race heads to a hand recount Sporting a bow tie over his black robes during marathon hearings on Wednesday and Thursday Walker played devil's advocate with both sides of the courtroom probing each argument with a mix of legalese current events and humor. He lamented the county's current lack of faith in democracy assured the courtroom that he was the most tired person there and compared lawyers representing Florida's and Republican interests to the three bears from "Goldilocks and the Three Bears.""They are kind of like the little bear" he said of their arguments with a smile "They are looking for it to be just right."A sprinkling of humorWalker's humor belies his importance in Florida politics but it has been well received even by the sometimes-humorless lawyers who often crack smiles at Walker's quips or even laugh.And Walker is willing to keep a joke going. He referenced Tribbles -- the rabbit-like creatures from "Star Trek" that were known to reproduce exponentially -- when he looked out into his courtroom on Wednesday and saw nearly two dozen lawyers before him. But what some didn't know was that reference was a call back to a joke he had made a day earlier."I feel a little bit like Captain Kirk in the episode when the Tribbles started to multiply" he had said about the number of lawsuits on a conference call earlier in the week.The jokes continued Thursday morning when Walker speaking to lawyers on yet another conference call hypothetically said he would rule in favor of the attorneys for Democrats and watch Republican heads explode like he saw in a movie once."I'll not make that movie reference" he said quickly moving along.Minutes later at the end of the call he assured all those listening that he was referencing the "Kingsman" movie series. (He ended by saying he was hoping that didn't actually happen to the lawyers.)When he asked the supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County Susan Bucher for a guess as to when she would be able to finish the manual and hand recount in the Senate race he did it with a imaginative caveat: "Godzilla could come out of the ocean at Palm Beach ... barring that when do you expect to finish?"For some judges references like this would be uncommon -- even bizarre. But Walker has sprinkled his hearings with an array of colorful comments much to the enjoyment of political aides who think the legal fight has become a slog.When a lawyer on the Republican side made an argument about standing Walker said it didn't pass the smell test and that he felt like he was having his face pushed into a "cow patty."During a hearing about how a voter's signature on a ballot may not match the signature they have on file Walker suggested a hypothetical: What should my grandmother who has Parkinson's and couldn't make the signature she once did do if she wanted to vote by mail? After lawyers attempted to answer the question Walker interjected to inform them that his grandmother was actually dead.When he ruled on that case Walker opened with a current events reference: the National Football League. "Consider the game of football" he wrote. "Football fans may quibble about the substance of the rules but no one quibbles that rules are necessary to play the game."Long days on the jobWalker in between making jokes has been working incredibly long hours. After two other federal judges recused themselves in election matters nearly every legal question on the recount fell to Walker forcing his staff and him to work until midnight for multiple days.That has clearly put everyone -- including Walker -- on edge and the judge has become testy with lawyers he thinks are wasting time.When a lawyer began asking an obvious question Walker jumped in: "Let's ask something other than a common-sense question." When the lawyer continued asking Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Mark Earley a question that had already been asked Walker hit back hard."I understand you are billing by the hour" Walker said curtly. "I recall the question the first time it was asked."Walker's ties to Florida run deep. Born in the city of Winter Garden he is what's known as a "double Gator" someone who completed undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Florida. Walker received his BA at the university in 1989 and graduated from the law school in 1992.Walker began his legal career by clerking with the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals and the Florida Supreme Court before briefly going into private practice. Before he was elevated by Obama in 2012 he served as a judge in the Circuit Court of Florida from 2009 to 2012.He has a history with one of the central figures in the recount: Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott who is challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's bid for re-election.Walker took Scott to task earlier this year when the judge invalidated the state of Florida's ban on allowing felons to vote."This Court finds Defendants' reasoning to be nonsensical" Walker wrote in his decision which referenced something not aging like fine wine and the long lines for Space Mountain a ride at Disney World. Walker also suggested that Scott's plan was arbitrary.Walker wrote: "A state cannot re-enfranchise only those felons who are more than six-feet tall who are blue-eyed who were born in August who root for the Florida Gators or who call heads during a coin flip."During a hearing on Thursday Walker said he not only held no ill will toward Scott but he also didn't know the governor."Gov. Scott and I don't know each other" Walker said during a hearing in a case over whether the governor should recuse himself from election matters. He then however pivoted to some media statements that have questioned the governor."And I won't impugn his press secretary's comments" he paused "about me."It's become clear during the days of recount challenges that Walker enjoys the give and take of a courtroom and the gentle ribbing that comes along with his position of power.When a lawyer from the canvassing board in Palm Beach County said they had made a decision because they were worried about being sued Walker jumped in with a joke about his caseload."I can't imagine" Walker said with a smile "a lawyer is going to sue over an election.",U.S.
Washington  (CNN)Former first lady Michelle Obama said that her oft-admired friendship with former President George W. Bush serves as a reminder of how relationships should be during a time when America only sees all the "nasty parts" of political discourse.In an interview released Wednesday on NBC Obama told Bush's daughter Jenna Bush Hager who is also a correspondent on "Today" that her relationship with Bush "reminds us that we can get there with the right leadership and with the right tone setting and with each of us giving one another the benefit of the doubt.""I'd love if we as a country could get back to the place where we didn't demonize people who disagreed with us" she added.Bringing up a famous photo of the former president and Obama sharing a hug in 2016 Bush Hager asked Obama about her friendship with Bush."It's so interesting how people are so interested in y'all's friendship. I mean that hug was like the hug that went around the world" Bush Hager said. "Why do you think people are so hungry for that though?" she asked Obama."Because I think the political discourse the way it's shown in the media is -- it's all the nasty parts of it. You know?" Obama replied. "Because I guess we've become a culture where the nasty sells. So people are just going to keep feeding that."Although Obama and Bush don't always agree on things Obama said she still considered the former president a "beautiful funny kind sweet man."Obama has been making her rounds on various networks to promote her new memoir "Becoming" which was released on Tuesday. The book is currently No. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list. ,U.S.
 (CNN)The Defense Department's first ever agency-wide financial audit discovered problems that cost approximately $559 million to fix the Pentagon said Thursday."We spent approximately $406 million on audit remediation and $153 million on financial system fixes" the Department of Defense's statement on the audit read.Several organizations -- including the Amy Navy Air Force Marine Corps the Defense Logistics Agency US Special Operations Command and US Transportation Command -- received "disclaimers" which "means they have multiple issues that need to be fixed" the statement said. The problems centered on inventory accuracy property and compliance pertaining to cybersecurity."We failed the audit but we never expected to pass it" Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. "Show me next year it takes less to audit and you have fewer findings that's what I'd want to see" Shanahan added.  The audit itself cost an additional $413 million with $192 million of that paid to independent public accounting firms like Ernst & Young and KPMG and the remainder covering government costs to support the audits.While they would not say how much money solving the problems identified by the audit would save defense officials did say that it should cover the cost of the audit.The Defense Department describes the audit as "the largest audit ever covering $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities."Approximately 1200 auditors conducted 900 site visits at over 600 locations including military bases depots and warehouses according to the Pentagon.Those auditors said they found no evidence of fraud and were able to account for the existence and completeness of major military equipment.Despite pressure from some members of Congress the Defense Department had historically pushed back on the notion of doing an audit arguing the Pentagon was too large for a traditional audit. All other federal agencies were subject to audits. However the Defense Department then agreed to the audit announcing it in December 2017. It was seen as necessary to help bring about an increase in funding for the military. "Congress directed DOD to conduct this audit to better manage the resources we dedicate to national defense. The process is an opportunity to find problems and identify areas for future reform" said Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee in a statement."As expected this audit has uncovered a number of matters that Congress and the Pentagon must work together to address" Thornberry added saying. "It should not be used as an excuse for arbitrary cuts."  A congressional aide told CNN the audit report may have the impact of underscoring readiness issues. For example if there are fewer weapons in inventories than previously thought that could change the readiness calculation. Also if it is determined that there are buildings and facilities on the books that are long gone that might reduce enthusiasm for a new round of base closures.,U.S.
It was the middle of the night and Ayal Lanternari was rushing to warm up refrigerated breast milk for his three-month-old baby.His son Daniel was hungry and there was nothing Lanternari could do to speed up the process. The only safe way to heat up cold or frozen breast milk is by putting it under running warm water or in a bowl of warm water — a process that can take 10 minutes or more."You can't microwave breast milk or heat it directly on the stove because it will damage the nutrients and the immunological property in the milk" says Lanternari a biomedical engineer.But like most new parents he was tired and frustrated and thought there had to be a better way. That's when he got an idea: What if he designed a baby bottle that spread out the breast milk into a thinner layer? Doing that would expand the liquid's surface area allowing it to warm up faster without damaging the nutrients."The bottle kind of designed itself in my head" said Lanternari.Instead of a typical cylindrical shape the bottle he envisioned was round "similar to the shape of a breast" he said. Later that same day Lanternari called his best friend Asaf Kehat and told him about it. "My first reaction was there was something so simple and genius about it. It was an obvious solution" says Kehat who is also a biomedical engineer. "I researched the baby bottle market and couldn't find anything like what Ayal had thought of."The two joined forces and spent almost a year conducting research and working on the design. Then in February 2013 their company Nanobébé was born. The birth of a product line It would take several years before the two could bring their product to market.Lanternari and Kehat who were living in Israel at the time spent the next five years on research and development testing their bottle with hundreds of parents infants lactation consultants and pediatricians."This wasn't just another product. Babies were going to use it. So we had to be very careful" says Kehat. Besides the efficacy of it they designed the bottle with a modern stylish look and made it easy for babies to hold.Testing by the company's own R&D team as well as certified lactation consultants and medical professionals showed their bottle cut the milk's warming time by more than half to about three to five minutes. Conversely the bottle's circular shape also cooled breast milk twice as fast as a conventional bottle says Lantenari.In February the company unveiled a stackable feeding bottle selling it online at Babies 'R' Us and at Buy Buy Baby stores across the US. (Babies 'R' Us went out of business a few months later as part of Toys R Us' bankruptcy)Lanternari and Kehat opened a US office in Charleston South Carolina earlier this month.The two entrepreneurs picked Charleston because it was ideally suited as a distribution hub for both domestic and overseas customers. Lanternari who recently moved to Charleston with his wife and three young children says the city also has a strong pipeline of available skilled workers in the health care and business development arenas. But the company's headquarters remains in Tel Aviv where all of the products are made. Kehat has stayed in Israel to oversee those operations.Although Nanobébé started with a baby bottle the company has evolved into a whole ecosystem of products including breast milk bottles breast milk storage bags for the fridge and freezer a microwave steam sterilizer unit drying rack pacifiers and warming bowl for the bottles."All of the related products like the stackable breast milk freezer bags and drying tray carry the Nanobébé DNA of functionality and innovation" says Lanternari. The bottles feature a hollow center which makes them stackable. The freezer bags can also be stored horizontally on top of each other to save space. And the bottles come with an adapter to attach them to a variety of breast pumps.So far the products have been a hit. "We sold out of our products twice in the first month at Babies 'R' Us" says Lanternari. Although the retailers' bankruptcy was a setback for the fledgling business other national retailers have since picked up the brand including Target and Wal-Mart. Nanobébé products are in 170 Target stores so far he says. In January the brand will roll out in 1215 Wal-Mart stores.Best friends since childhoodLanternari and Kehat grew up together in Israel and have led parallel lives."We've known each other since we were five years old and have been best friends ever since" says Lanternari. "We are brothers."Both are 39. Their parents were neighbors. They were classmates in school and went to the same university — Israel's Technion Institute of Technology — and pursued the same major. After graduating Kehat joined medical device maker Mazor Robotics where he was a clinical and sales manager for several years. Lanternari started his career as an engineer with Novocure an oncology company that develops treatments for patients with solid tumors. He later worked for a company that managed engineering and infrastructure projects.Both men left their jobs in 2013 to focus on Nanobébé. At the outset they personally invested "hundred of thousands" of dollars of their own savings. But eventually they sought funding.To date the business has raised several million dollars from Israeli venture capital firms and InterTech Group a privately-held holding company.Nanobébé now employs 30 people and its bottle has won a number of industry awards including TTPM [Toys Tots Pets & Mom] Best of Baby Award for 2018. While the recognition is welcome Kehat said the company's mission is to keep the products affordable for parents. Prices range from $22.99 for a 3-pack of bottles to $49.99 for a "starter pack" with four bottles two pacifiers and a bottle warming bowl.As the company expands sales globally — the brand is also available in Israel France Belgium and Canada — Kehat says Nanobébé's team is working ahead on other innovative products."To get this kind of pickup for our first product in our launch year was completely unexpected" says Kehat adding that sales in just the first few months are "going amazing.""Our innovation isn't just for babies" he says. "It's for everyone's benefit — moms dads and caregivers." ,U.S.
New York (CNN)A new startup called Tap has a bold ambition: convince people to stop buying plastic bottles of water.Tap launched an app Tuesday that displays nearby clean drinking water locations from restaurants and retail stores to public water fountains so you can refill your water bottle. It's like Google Maps for clean drinking water.The Tap app available for free on Android and iOS highlights 34000 refill stations across 7100 cities in 30 countries. The company spent a few months crowdsourcing locations around the world that are either open to the public or OK with having people wander into their storefronts asking for water refills. "Water is a mispriced public good" founder Samuel Rosen told CNN Business. "I believe we as consumers have been robbed of our own water and sold back to us by corporations." Rosen is the cofounder and former CEO of on-demand storage startup MakeSpace. In November 2017 he left his CEO role at the startup. He came up with the concept for his next startup after paying $5 for a bottle of Evian at the airport.By making it easy and inexpensive to find water nearby Tap hopes people will cut down on plastic waste and change their behavior.Consumers may also start seeing blue "Tap" signs in store windows signaling the business is friendly to thirsty guests. The app provides profiles on each location and what it offers such as flavored or sparkling water and whether it comes free or at cost from a water cooler counter service or a drinking fountain.Earlier this month the UN Intergovernmental Panel released a bombshell climate change report that warned global warming is on track to have a disastrous impact if nothing changes by 2030. The report said the impact could result in extreme drought wildfires floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. Plastic waste is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions which causes the Earth's surface temperature to rise. Eight million tons of plastic enter the water each year according to the World Economic Forum and more plastic is expected in our oceans than fish by 2050 in terms of weight if our current usage of plastic continues.But Tap isn't the first to connect people to clean drinking water. Nonprofit WeTap an app that has been around for about six years helps people find to the closest public drinking fountains. If Tap gets off the ground its unclear if stores will be bombarded by people looking for refills and how retailers might react. But Rosen is steadfast: "The future is bottle-less." ,U.S.
I want to put some money into alternative investments but I'm not sure where to begin. What's the safest alternative for an average investor?Alternative investments are becoming increasingly attractive and more readily available to the average investor. With interest rates on the rise and the bull market beginning to show signs of fatigue investors are turning to these investments to increase their diversification grow their returns and get some downside protection. Easier access to alternative investments like commodities cryptocurrencies collectibles venture capital real estate or private equity also means these holdings are no longer solely for the uber-wealthy.But how safe are they for average investors?"Some alternatives are investments others are no more than speculation" says Bradley Nelson an investment adviser and president at Lyon Park Advisors. Traditional investments he says have intrinsic worth most often a stream of revenue. "But the worth of a speculative investment depends primarily on the 'greater fool theory' or what someone else is willing to pay for it."While alternative investments are attractive since they are generally negatively correlated with the stock market and some including commodities like gold or oil tend to be good hedges against inflation they also come with many challenges. They may have higher fees and steeper barriers to entry. They can also be more volatile and are often less liquid than stocks or bonds.But they can sometimes carry higher upside potential as long as you do your research before investing. Know what you're getting intoAlternative investments should be approached the same way as traditional investments says Nick Stanley a certified investment management analyst with Protege Wealth Planning.He says to ask yourself the following questions: Does the investment improve my portfolio's diversification? Can I afford to bear the risk? Do I understand how this investment strategy works and the underlying investments?Stanley likes structured products and exchange-traded funds or ETFs for retail investors because they take complicated alternative investments and make them manageable for less sophisticated investors. "Most alternative investments are 'alternative' because they typically utilize investments or strategies that are difficult for most people outside of the financial services industry to understand" Stanley says. "They also may carry risk that the average investor cannot afford." Structured products can take a complex investment strategy like using short positions options or futures and bundle them together into a product that consumers can understand."Before deciding on structured products investors should understand their potential maximum gains or losses."Tread lightlyA big mistake alternative investors make is chasing yield or returns says Stanley. "I tell clients that if something outperforms enough to draw public attention it's probably already too late to make the investment" he says. With cryptocurrencies he says investors hear about 100% gains and want to jump on board. But most likely the owners of cryptocurrency exchanges will earn more profits from the crypto fever than the actual investors in the currency. Another pitfall with alternatives is purchasing an individual asset or security. That will greatly increase your exposure to risk says Nelson. "We always recommend a mutual fund when investing in an asset category."For example rather than going all in on a single real estate investment Nelson recommends looking at real estate investment trusts or REITs. "Real estate is a very traditional alternative investment and there are several options for investment in low-expense REIT mutual funds."With investments like alternative lending (a peer-to-peer platform not directly associated with traditional banks and mortgage lenders) or reinsurance (insurance for insurance companies) he says to proceed with great caution. "Only invest a small allocation to your portfolio" he advises.Also be wary of commodity funds says Chris Jackson certified financial planner and founder of Lionshare Partners. "Commodity funds don't invest directly in the commodity but in their commodity future contracts" says Jackson. This means investors are buying futures when they are higher on the curve at a more expensive price and selling them at a lower price.  "Buying high and selling low — not a profitable practice" he says.Proceed with cautionCommodities appeared as an attractive alternative investment decades ago but are now overused by investors says Nelson. He no longer recommends them. Also on his no-go list: private equity and venture capital which he says have expenses that are too high and transparency that is too low.Nelson also steers clear of investing in raw land which does not produce any income and is pure speculation and cryptocurrency since it's unstable and does not generate income.And please put down the collectibles he says."They don't generate income their worth is generally not intrinsic but only what other people are willing to pay" he says. "Good luck selling your Beanie Baby collection.",U.S.
 (CNN)A man says he's sorry for causing a commotion in a Baltimore theater last week by yelling "Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!" during a performance of "Fiddler on the Roof." "I opened my mouth and it was so wrong. I know that now" the man told CNN affiliate WBAL. "I don't know what I was thinking. I'm so ashamed."The man identified in a police incident report as Anthony M. Derlunas 58 told WBAL and the Sun that he's actually anti-Trump and anti-hate.He told the Sun that the musical reminded him of Trump's immigration policies. His comparison "came out wrong" and was "beyond a mistake" he told the newspaper.The outburst comes at a time of a dramatic spike in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States and follows last month's Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in which a gunman killed 11 worshippers. "Fiddler on the Roof" is an award-winning musical based on the "Tevye" stories by Sholem Aleichem about a Jewish family facing persecution in Tsarist Russia. The incident happened Wednesday night about 10 minutes into the first intermission at Baltimore's Hippodrome Theatre audience members told CNN. The final scene before intermission reminded the man of his hatred for Trump according to a police report of the incident and he then stood up to yell "Heil Hitler! Heil Trump!"Rich Scherr a contributor for The Baltimore Sun witnessed the man who was seated in the upper balcony shouting the pro-Nazi salute."Several people in the audience began running toward the exits" Scherr told CNN. "I personally thought I was about to hear gunshots."Scherr who later posted a video from the incident on Facebook and Twitter said the man went on to shout other things before security took him out. The show resumed 10 minutes later.It is not possible to discern what the man was saying from the video which shows audience members' apparently concerned reactions.Samit Verma a journalist at Voice of America was seated in the balcony on the right side of the theater with his wife when he heard the man shouting."I initially could not make out what the man was saying but as more people exited the main theater I could clearly see him making a Hitler salute and yelling 'Heil Hitler!' " Verma told CNN. "Everyone around me appeared quite shaken by the experience and some people were in tears."Another audience member Heather O'Hare said everyone was shuffling and getting up to go to the restroom during the intermission when she heard the disturbance. "People in the front orchestra seats started to turn and look up at the balcony and someone started shouting back: 'Go Home Nazi!' " she said. "We were kind (of) confused and numb about what actually was happening but several audience members were palpably upset and decided to leave during the intermission break. The entire right half of the row in front of me was gone after Act One."'Many Jewish families ... were visibly shaken' Kasey Chisholm was in the lobby with her father during intermission when the outburst occurred. She saw security swarm in and escort the man out."We found out what he had been yelling when we returned to our seats" she said. "Many Jewish families were around our seats and were visibly shaken." Connor Drew was also in the lobby at the time. When he returned to his seat he said he saw a woman next to him "shaking while on the phone with her son."In a statement released to CNN affiliate WJZ the Hippodrome Theatre said "Behavior like we saw during intermission at Wednesday evening's performance is not and will not be tolerated."The Hippodrome's on-site security team along with our usher staff were able to remedy the situation and remove the offending audience member quickly coordinating efforts with local police who met the man as he was escorted out of the building."Police found Derlunas standing outside the theater "in a calm manner" with a female companion according to the police incident report. Officers spoke with the two and they were allowed to leave the area.CNN's David Williams contributed to this report. ,U.S.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump disparaged Rep. Adam Schiff in a profane tweet Sunday misspelling his name "Schitt" and accusing the likely incoming House Intelligence chairman of baselessly criticizing the appointment of acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. "So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!" Trump wrote.Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and like many other Department of Justice appointees he did not require Senate confirmation for the position. The White House did not immediately return CNN's request for comment Sunday evening on whether Trump purposely misspelled Schiff's name.Democrats have criticized Trump's appointment of Whitaker who now oversees Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election citing the appointee's past criticisms of the investigation. Some Democratic lawmakers such as Schiff and some legal scholars -- including George Conway the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- have also criticized Whitaker's appointment as unconstitutional because he was not confirmed by the Senate. Yet others have argued that the appointment is valid because he's only serving on a temporary basis under the Federal Vacancies Act.After firing former Attorney General Jeff Sessions who angered Trump by recusing himself from issues related to the 2016 campaign the President chose Whitaker over Rosenstein who had overseen the Mueller probe.Mueller's appointment and constitutional authority was upheld in August by a federal judge appointed by Trump who wrote in an opinion that Mueller's "appointment does not violate core separation-of-powers principles." Schiff shot back at Trump on Sunday insinuating in a tweet that the President's lawyers are writing Trump's answers to Mueller's questions in the Russia investigation for the President. Trump told reporters on Friday that he was personally crafting the answers to Mueller saying "My lawyers don't write answers. I write answers. I was asked a series of questions. I've answered them very easily."In his response to Trump's name-calling tweet on Sunday Schiff wrote "Wow Mr. President that's a good one. Was that like your answers to Mr. Mueller's questions or did you write this one yourself?"In an interview on ABC News' "This Week" Sunday morning Schiff said that Whitaker's appointment was unconstitutional and would not hold up in court."I think the appointment is unconstitutional" Schiff said. "He is clearly a principal officer and the fact that he is a temporary principle officer doesn't mean that that is any less subject to Senate confirmation. Constitutionally it has to be subject to confirmation. I think they'd lose that court -- that case when it goes to the Supreme Court." Schiff promised that House Democrats would investigate Whitaker's appointment once they take the majority in January."He needs to know that if he takes any action to curb what Mr. Mueller does we're going to find out about it we're going to expose it" he said.,U.S.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump said "it's going to be up to him" when asked if he would accept any move by acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. When Fox News' Chris Wallace asked Trump in an interview that aired on "Fox News Sunday" if the President would accept Whitaker limiting the Mueller investigation Trump replied that he was confident Whitaker would "do what's right.""I think he's astute politically. He's a very smart person a very respected person" Trump said. "He's going to do what's right. I really believe he's going to do what's right." Pressed to elaborate Trump said "I would not get involved. And all these people that say I'm going to end the investigation you know they've been saying that now for -- how long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for what? ... From the day I announced."Trump also said that he was not aware before appointing Whitaker that he had been critical of Mueller's investigation."I did not know that. I did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such" Trump said.Before joining the Justice Department in 2017 as recently fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff Whitaker said that "there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign." Whitaker "happened to be right" Trump said."So if he said there is collusion I'm supposed to be taking somebody that says there is?" the President added. "Because then I wouldn't take him for two reasons but the No. 1 reason is the fact that he would have been wrong."Asked what he thought when learned of Whitaker's views on the Mueller probe Trump said "I don't think it had any effect. If you look at those statements those statements that can -- they really can be viewed either way but I don't think it will have any impact.",U.S.
Washington (CNN Politics)President Donald Trump said this week that his replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement "is one of the great trade deals you'll see."But that didn't stop American automakers produce growers retailers and labor groups from expressing concerns this week at the first hearing held since the deal known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA was announced in September.The two-day hearing in Washington before the International Trade Commission offered a road map to issues that could sink the deal when Congress reviews it early next year. While lawmakers can't offer a total rewrite they can make changes to the language of the bill -- or hold up a vote until side deals are struck between countries on thorny issues. There's no deadline for ratification but lawmakers are likely to wait to vote until the ITC releases its report on the economic impact. The commission has until 105 days after the signing or mid-March to deliver its report to Congress. Here are five things that could cause headaches for Trump along the way:CarsThe USMCA tightens rules for manufacturing cars and trucks. In order to remain duty free the USMCA increases the portion of a vehicle's parts that must be made in the United States Canada or Mexico. It also adds a wage stipulation requiring that some of the parts are made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. Some of the auto industry representatives said it would be complicated and costly to comply with these new rules. But former Missouri Republican Gov. Matt Blunt who represents the big three automakers -- Fiat Chrysler GM and Ford -- called the new rules "workable." In general he said the group is optimistic the USMCA will "help maintain the competitiveness" of the industry.Blunt said he thinks the new content rules will bring more investment to the United States in the long term but noted "we don't see any immediate impact." The idea is that content restrictions will bring manufacturing back into North America and that raising wages in Mexico would put upward pressure on those in the United States and Canada too. Mexico has also committed to recognize workers' right to collectively bargain.But some Democrats as well as the US union groups are skeptical that these provisions will have a significant impact for labor. "If the commission simply assumes that words on the page are sufficient to transform Mexico's repressive labor regime it will make a grave error" said Celeste Drake the trade and globalization policy specialist at the AFL-CIO on Thursday."There is nothing in the text that would limit the current unfettered discretion to ignore blatant labor violations" she added. The union as well as the Teamsters who historically oppose free trade deals have not yet taken a final position on the USMCA awaiting further analysis and the ITC report. Their support could be critical for getting enough Democratic votes. StrawberriesFruit and vegetable growers in Florida and Georgia are upset that the USMCA does nothing to protect them from lower-priced produce coming from Mexico. A lot of what's grown in the Southeastern United States including strawberries blueberries tomatoes and bell peppers are also grown across the border during the same seasons.  "Unfortunately the trade environment created under NAFTA and the trade environment that will be created under USMCA is anything but a fair and level playing field for Florida's producers" said Adam Putnam the state's commissioner of agriculture. He and other industry representatives said that low labor costs and subsidies from the government allows Mexican growers to sell fruit and vegetables in the United States for less than the cost of production. Imports have escalated since the original NAFTA took effect.Kenneth Parker the executive director of the Florida Strawberry Growers Association said the USMCA would be "devastating" for Florida growers.The trade agreement "plac(es) at peril the economic livelihood of Florida strawberry growers and their communities" Parker said. Beer cansThe tariffs that Trump has imposed on steel and aluminum imports were the elephant in the room throughout the two-day hearing. The USMCA would not lift those duties for Canada or Mexico and many groups -- from automakers to breweries -- said the tariffs could cancel out the benefits generated by the new trade deal. Beer Institute CEO Jim McGreevy said more than 60% of beer made in the United States is packaged in aluminum cans and that the tariffs are driving up the cost. The USMCA he said does not include any provisions that would hurt beer trade but the tariffs should have been addressed in the negotiations. The tariffs which Trump imposed to protect the domestic steel and aluminum industries in the interest of national security are a separate issue and can be lifted by the administration outside of the trade deal. But the issue could be addressed in the agreement or Congress could hold off on approving the USMCA until the tariffs are eliminated. "Exempting Mexico and Canada from the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum strengthens the agreement and will in turn strengthen the US manufacturing base" said Ann Wilson who represents the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.US steel producers have benefited from the tariffs but Heidi Brock CEO of the Aluminum Association said that's not the case for her members. A majority of aluminum jobs in the US are not in primary production but at manufacturers that import the metal from foreign countries. She said there is a problem with subsidized aluminum coming from China but that the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican aluminum should be lifted. The tariffs "will hamper continued growth and investment for our industry here at home" Brock said. PocketsYes pockets. Both the apparel and textile industries have benefited from NAFTA and said they could support a lot of what's in its replacement. But they disagree over one provision that apparel makers say could make it harder for them to manufacture inside North America.  The USMCA requires apparel products to use more North American-made fabrics in order to qualify for trade benefits. It specifically mentions sewing thread pocketing fabric and narrow elastic bands. Those restrictions "will make it more expensive and complicated for American brands and retailers to use the agreement" said Julia Hughes president of the United States Fashion Industry Association. "We are concerned that there will be some companies who shift operations out of the Western Hemisphere or decide not to move new orders to Canada or Mexico because of these cost increases" she added.The requirement is welcomed by the textile industry. Augustine Tantillo president of the National Council of Textile Organizations said North American factories can meet the demand and will offer a boost to US producers. But Rick Helfenbein president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association is unsure that shifting suppliers would be easy. The new restriction "may lead to less -- not more -- US content being used in North American supply chains" he said. Prescription drugsThe generic drug lobby and a group that focuses on improving innovation and access to new medical technologies expressed serious concerns about the USMCA on Friday. Most contentious is a provision that will provide a 10-year period of marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs. "In it's current form the USMCA will decrease competition for some medicines and lead to higher prescription drug prices for Americans" said Jeffrey Francer general counsel for the Association for Accessible Medications. In a recent letter to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer the group was joined by the AARP Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and more than 20 other groups to oppose the agreement. But the brand-name drug lobbying group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America supports the agreement particularly for its intellectual property protections that they say will "pave the way for the next generation of treatments and cures" according to a statement released in October. Correction: This story previously misidentified Beer Institute CEO Jim McGreevy as the former governor of New Jersey. ,U.S.
Washington  (CNN)Retired Adm. William McRaven on Sunday stood by his previous statement that President Donald Trump's attacks on the news media represent "the greatest threat to democracy" after the President dismissed him as a "Hillary Clinton backer" in an interview that aired on Fox News. "I did not back Hillary Clinton or anyone else" McRaven who oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden told CNN. "I am a fan of President Obama and President George W. Bush both of whom I worked for. I admire all presidents regardless of their political party who uphold the dignity of the office and who use that office to bring the nation together in challenging times.""I stand by my comment that the President's attack on the media is the greatest threat to our democracy in my lifetime" McRaven said referencing remarks he made about Trump last year. "When you undermine the people's right to a free press and freedom of speech and expression then you threaten the Constitution and all for which it stands." McRaven's comment came just hours after "Fox News Sunday" aired an interview with Trump in which the President dismissed McRaven and criticized the military for having not killed bin Laden sooner. Trump made the remarks during a tense exchange with Fox News' Chris Wallace after the host brought up McRaven a vocal Trump critic who led the bin Laden operation in 2011 during former President Barack Obama's administration."Bill McRaven retired admiral Navy SEAL 37 years former head of US Special Operations..." Wallace started."Hillary Clinton fan" Trump said cutting off Wallace."Special Operations ..." Wallace continued."Excuse me Hillary Clinton fan" Trump said."Who led the operations" Wallace added "commanded the operations that took down Saddam Hussein and that killed Osama bin Laden says that your sentiment is the greatest threat to democracy in his lifetime." "OK he's a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama-backer and frankly ... wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that? Wouldn't it have been nice? You know living -- think of this -- living in Pakistan beautifully in Pakistan."After Wallace asked if the President would give McRaven any credit for taking down bin Laden Trump said "they took him down" but quickly shifted to talking about US aid to Pakistan where bin Laden was killed. In August McRaven issued a stunning rebuke of Trump in an op-ed published in the Washington Post writing that through his actions Trump has "embarrassed us in the eyes of our children humiliated us on the world stage and worst of all divided us as a nation."

 (CNN)Michael Bloomberg the former New York mayor who is weighing a 2020 presidential run is donating $1.8 billion to his alma mater Johns Hopkins.The university and Bloomberg are calling it the biggest contribution to an academic institution in American history according to a press release -- and the gift's record-setting size will not be lost on possible challengers in a Democratic primary. Last week Bloomberg said he plans to decide on a 2020 bid no later than February a spokesperson confirmed to CNN.The gift will fund financial aid for qualified low- and middle-income students allowing the university to forever make admissions decisions on a "need-blind" basis — without considering an applicant's ability to pay according to the press release.The contribution also eliminates student loans from financial aid packages replacing those loans with grants that don't need to be repaid.  The change will ease the burden of student debt for many graduates and make the campus more socioeconomically diverse Bloomberg wrote in a New York Times op-ed in which he explains his rationale for the gift and the impact it will have."America is at its best when we reward people based on the quality of their work not the size of their pocketbook" he wrote.Improving access to top colleges and universities for students who can't afford it has long been a focus of Bloomberg's philanthropic efforts. Bloomberg's foundation supports several programs dedicated to helping high-achieving lower-income students apply to enroll in and graduate from top institutions."This changes everything for us" said Ronald J. Daniels the president of Johns Hopkins University in an interview with CNN. Without Bloomberg's support it was a "real struggle" for the school to meet its commitment to "need-blind" admissions said Daniels. Compared to its top 10 peers Johns Hopkins had one of the lowest endowed funds for student financial aid and one of the smallest average need-based awards making it increasingly difficult for families to afford the university according to the press release. Excluding the Johns Hopkins donation Bloomberg has  donated $6.4 billion to philanthropic causes ranging from climate change to improving health. The university is a significant beneficiary of Bloomberg's giving having received $1.5 billion in previous years to support research teaching and financial aid.Potential opponents in 2020 would have to consider Bloomberg's wealth which Forbes estimates to be $46 billion and his willingness to spend it. The businessman contributed over $110 million in an effort to wrest control of the House and Senate from Republicans.Bloomberg's political spending and his appearance in a national TV ad earlier this month urging voters to support Democrats raised his profile outside of New York where he's well known after serving three terms as mayor.Bloomberg embarked on a political career after building a financial information and news empire Bloomberg L.P.  In the New York Times op-ed Bloomberg says his Johns Hopkins "diploma opened up doors that otherwise would have been closed and allowed me to live the American dream.",U.S.
 (CNN)President Donald Trump said Sunday that he anticipates shifting several positions in his administration hinting that the departures could include Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly."I have three or four or five positions that I'm thinking about" Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace during an interview that aired on "Fox News Sunday." "Of that maybe it's going to end up being two. Maybe. But I want to -- I need flexibility."Trump has been mulling an administration shakeup in recent weeks with Nielsen anticipated as possibly the next to go multiple officials with knowledge of the matter have told CNN. The officials describe Trump as dissatisfied over Nielsen's handling of his key issues of immigration and border security. Trump has also floated possible replacements for Kelly including Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers.In the interview Trump praised Nielsen as intelligent but stressed that she was not as "tough" as he wanted her to be."I like her a lot. I respect her a lot. She's very smart" Trump said of Nielsen. "I want her to get much tougher and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough."When asked the chances that she would remain homeland security secretary Trump said "there's a chance" she would but that people who have left his White House have been successful."Well there's a chance. But there's a chance everybody -- I mean that's what happens in government. You leave you make a name you go" Trump said. "The people that have left have done very well. The people that have left have done very well from my White House. I like her very much I respect her very much. I'd like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher period."Trump also discussed Kelly's future saying that while they "get along well" and Kelly is "doing an excellent job" there are some things that aren't his strength."There are certain things I love what he does and there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- that aren't his strength" Trump said. "It's not that he doesn't do -- you know he works so hard. He's doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it's just not his strength. It's not his fault. It's not his strength."Asked to elaborate on what he meant Trump said "But I haven't even thought about John in terms of this. But John at some point is going to want to move on. John will move on."When questioned on whether Trump's promise last July that Kelly would be at the White House through 2020 was no longer definite the President said "Yeah it could happen. Yeah it could -- I mean it could be. But let's see what happens.",U.S.
 (CNN)Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson on Sunday conceded the Florida Senate race to Republican Gov. Rick Scott ending his re-election bid after the completion of a statewide recount.  Scott announced the concession in a statement saying "I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson who graciously conceded and I thanked him for his years of public service." Nelson officially announced his concession in a taped statement on Sunday."I was not victorious in this race but I still wish to strongly reaffirm the cause for which we fought a public office is a public trust" he said.Nelson added that he "by no measure feel(s) defeated" and reflected on his career in politics by saying he doesn't believe "anybody could have been as blessed."The concession brings to conclusion a key Senate race that continued to be fought well after Election Day.The Senate race -- along with the governor's and state's race for agriculture commissioner -- went to a machine recount a week ago but the recount did not do nearly enough for Nelson and further formalized Scott's more than 12000-vote lead. The contest still fell within the .25% standard for a manual recount of overvotes and undervotes however.Nelson conceded after the noon deadline for the manual recount when all of Florida's 67 counties were required to submit their final vote totals to the secretary of state meaning every vote deemed admissible by county canvassing boards and the courts had been officially counted.The results of the recount showed Scott with a vote lead of 10033 over incumbent Nelson. Before the completion of the manual recount Scott had a lead of 12603 votes.Nelson's concession comes a day after Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum ended his campaign for governor by acknowledging that Republican Ron DeSantis had defeated him. The concession was a blow to Nelson given the two top Democrats had figuratively stood together in calling for every legal vote cast in Florida to be counted. Gillum's bowing out was an acknowledgment that many Democrats in the state believe the fight is over.Nelson acknowledged voting rights in his concession an issue that was at the heart of both his and Gillum's messaging during the recount."We must end all forms of voter suppression make it easier for Americans to vote and honor the idea that we are governed by the majority and not the minority" Nelson said.Nelson's loss ends his nearly two-decade tenure in the Senate where he most recently served as the ranking member on the Senate Commerce Committee and previously served as the chair of the Senate Aging Committee.Nelson has been a fixture in Florida politics for more than four decades serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives for six years in the 1970s before vaulting to the US House of Representatives in 1979 where he served for 12 years.Nelson faced an onslaught of spending in a race that likely topped $100 million just for ads on TV according to data from CMAG.And he was a top target for President Donald Trump who considers Florida one of his home states because of Mar-a-Lago the private club he has owned since 1985. Trump made a pair of last-minute trips to Florida to help Scott rallying with the Republican governor and DeSantis in Fort Myers and then Pensacola during the final week of the campaign.Scott who is independently wealthy raised an eye-popping $68 million this cycle burying Nelson's $27 million.But the Democratic outside money came in for Nelson after the primary with Senate Majority PAC investing nearly $17 million Priorities USA backing him with just over $8 million and Majority Forward spending another $5 million on Nelson's behalf.Guns and the environment took an outsized role in this race. Both Scott and Nelson pointed fingers at each other over toxic algae blooms impacting the state's waterways hoping to woo a group of single-issue environmental voters in the state. And guns have played a large role in the state after the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida left 17 people dead.But some of Nelson's most potent ads came in linking Scott to the President attacks that put the governor on the defensive.One Spanish-language ad for Nelson shows Scott shaking Trump's hand. Rick Scott and Donald Trump are "muy buenos amigos" the ad says -- very good friends.The attacks seemingly worked because Scott had to respond by distancing himself from the President."When I don't agree with what President Trump does or says I've said it" Scott said in an ad. "My only commitment is with you.",U.S.
 (CNN)Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice downplayed an odd ESPN report that the NFL's Cleveland Browns are considering her for their head coach position.ESPN's Adam Schefter citing a league source reported Sunday that the Browns would like to interview Rice for the open job. Rice who is a Browns fan but has no football coaching experience did not explicitly turn down the opportunity but said she was "not ready" to coach."I love my Browns -- and I know they will hire an experienced coach to take us to the next level" Rice said in a statement.She would be the first woman to be interviewed as head coach."On a more serious note I do hope that the NFL will start to bring women into the coaching profession as position coaches and eventually coordinators and head coaches. One doesn't have to play the game to understand it and motivate players. But experience counts -- and it is time to develop a pool of experienced women coaches" she said."BTW -- I'm not ready to coach but I would like to call a play or two next season if the Browns need ideas! And at no time will I call for a 'prevent defense.' "Browns general manager John Dorsey also said in a statement that the architect of former President George W. Bush's foreign policy has not been discussed as a Browns coaching candidate.Rice is "a great leader possesses the highest possible character and also happens to be a Browns fan" Dorsey said. "I have the utmost respect and admiration for all she's accomplished and was honored to meet her for the first time earlier this season. "Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed."Though it's unlikely that a newbie would be hired to a major coaching position Rice does have experience in executive roles in sports. She was a member of the College Football Playoff selection committee for three years and she chaired a committee that proposed changes to NCAA basketball.The Browns one of the worst teams in the NFL over the past decade fired coach Hue Jackson two weeks ago. He won just three out of 40 games over two and a half years with the team so there's almost nowhere to go but up.CNN's Homer DeLaFuente contributed to this report.,U.S.
 (CNN)Sadia Quint has every indication her uncle has perished in the Camp Fire. But no one can tell her for sure. "We already know that his house has been burned down and his car was in his garage" she said. "So now we're just waiting for the sheriff's department to go out there and let us know if his body's in there or not." Like hundreds of families Quint fluctuates between holding out hope and resigning to the notion that her loved one is gone. In the decimated California town of Paradise where her uncle David William Marbury lived the odds of survival seem bleak. At least 1300 people remain unaccounted for since the Camp Fire started its deadly rampage across Northern California 10 days ago. The inferno is still raging out of control as sheriff's deputies National Guard members and coroners sift through rubble. "We're being patient just because we know we're not the only family that's going through this right now" Quint told CNN. "So everyone's kind of in it together and everyone's being really supportive."The Camp Fire has already killed 76 people though many of the victims haven't been identified. Some remains are charred beyond recognition. So Quint's family has embarked on the grim task of providing DNA samples in case authorities find Marbury's remains.It's not clear when Quint will learn the fate of her uncle but she's already referring to him in the past tense. "He had respiratory issues and he had back problems and he was 66" she said. "I mean it's hard to think about him not being here anymore. But as a family we have accepted whether we get good or bad news. So we're just prepared for both.",U.S.
 (CNN)When a house of worship is attacked -- when it becomes a crime scene stained with blood -- how do you move forward? How do you come back to worship and make it a safe holy place again? How do you support your congregation as it reels from the loss?The Rev. Eric Manning and the Rev. Frank Pomeroy were both forced to face these questions when gunmen stormed their sanctuaries. On June 17 2015 Dylann Roof a self-described white supremacist killed nine members of Charleston South Carolina's historically black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church including the then-pastor during a Bible study session. Roof was sentenced to death in January 2017. Nine months later Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 people at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs Texas on November 5 2017 -- the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. Kelley took his life afterward. In the aftermath of the shootings at their sanctuaries Manning and Pomeroy have embraced the role of being shepherds to their congregations -- exercising patience as members push through their grief attending a murder trial and facilitating discussions around difficult decisions like what to do with the sanctuary. Now rabbis at the Tree of Life synagogue find themselves in a similar position after a gunman killed 11 worshipers last month in Pittsburgh. Manning and Pomeroy shared with CNN some of what they learned as they helped their flocks heal.  'Don't let evil win even for a bit'Pomeroy 52 was traveling with his wife on the morning of the attack on First Baptist Church. A guest pastor preached the day's message. Pomeroy's daughter Annabelle -- a 14-year-old who loved the color purple so much it covered the walls and carpet of her room -- was killed. To begin with Pomeroy said religious leaders must make sure to focus on God and on the people around them."Even prior to the tragedy you've got to make sure your church is focused on Christ something bigger than yourself. So that in the aftermath you're not trying to run under your own power or focus on the things that are just about you" he said."As long as you're already focused on something greater than yourself or focused on others then in the aftermath you'll be able to do the same. You'll already have the habit of focusing on others through Christ."He recalls being "somewhat in a fog" for the first few weeks after the shooting but said it is important to focus on the survivors. He tried to remind them they were not alone he said.  "My immediate attention would be to focus on the lives first of the survivors and the family of the victims and then the rest of the body as a whole" Pomeroy said. Seven days after the shooting Sutherland Springs held service again this time in a community center next to the church."As a body we felt like if we had skipped Sundays or closed the church then evil won -- even for a little bit" Pomeroy said.He said he can't say whether he was coherent then. He went through the motions relying on "muscle memory" he said. "The words just came forth" he said. 'There is no magical date' Mother Emanuel Church was an active crime scene; it had to be returned to a house of worship before the church held service again four days after the fatal shooting. "After it is released they never clean it they never turn it back to the way that it was before. So then you have to go through the process of having professionals come in to clean it" said Manning 50. And that was hard said Manning who was handpicked to shepherd the congregation a year after the shooting. "Even though the cleaning crew did come in they were never able to remove all the bullet strikes on the floor" he said. Manning said it's important to be "mindful that though there may be a push to get the sanctuary the mosque or the synagogue reopened don't rush it." He said members of the congregation may have different feelings on when to hold service again.Days after the shooting in Pittsburgh Manning flew there to meet and offer comfort to Rabbi Jeffrey Myers who lost several members of his congregation."I've been there" Manning said.Both Manning and Pomeroy said the congregation as a whole should decide whether to leave the house of worship and when to return."There's no magical day. There's no magical date" for that decision to be made Manning said.  Manning said Emanuel's leaders rededicated the lower level where the shooting took place to God in April 2017 "in a quiet prayer ceremony of anointing" "Now people may say that really doesn't do anything. But from a spiritual perspective it does" he said.The congregation discussed remodeling the room where the shooting took place but decided against it Manning said. He agreed.  "I don't want anyone to forget the price that was paid and what happened here" he said. Immediately after the shooting First Baptist turned its sanctuary into a memorial. A new sanctuary is being built behind the memorial while the church holds service in modular buildings Pomeroy said."That ground will always be hallowed ground whether we leave the sanctuary there whether it becomes a garden or whatever it may be" Pomeroy said. "The church is within the people; it's just concrete wood and shingles to me."Pomeroy said North American Mission Board which performs missionary outreach for the Southern Baptist Convention and establishes churches offered to build a new church.At some point the congregation will have to decide what to do with the old sanctuary in the long-term Pomeroy said. Be a shepherd Manning said part of his role was to be a shepherd through Roof's trial. In the courtroom he prayed for families of victims and wrote prayers for those testifying. But he didn't shoulder the burden alone.A team of pastors prayed with Manning reflected on scripture and sang songs of praise before the trial he said. "That helped immensely because you were renewed every day and your mind was renewed every day" Manning said.He used sermons to address issues uncovered during the trial because it seemed the only way to address them was through scripture. "At times people would say through those sermons that I preached or in that time period they got the feeling I was ministering to myself" Manning recalled. Remember that everyone grieves differentlyBoth leaders say it's important to not rush their congregation's healing -- to be patient with them and sit with them when needed. Pomeroy said he has encouraged survivors to seek professional therapy and counseling. "As a body coming together and just trusting the Lord to bring this to be" helps with the healing too he said. "It all comes down to whether or not we're letting God work in our hearts and our lives" he said. He said it's also important to remember that everyone mourns at their own pace; there are times when he feels he's past the darkest days of his grief while his wife Sherri is still struggling."Even though we're in the same house been married 32 years we're just different people" he said.  "Every person grieves a little differently." "I'll just try to be there to listen as we go" he said.On the one-year anniversary earlier this month Pomeroy read off the names of victims. It was "probably one of the most difficult things I've ever done" he said.  But in the end he said it was very healing for everyone.,U.S.
Washington  (CNN)President Donald Trump said that he plans to visit US troops in war zones a remark that comes after he received widespread criticism for not visiting an American burial ground outside Paris France earlier this month and Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. "Well I think you will see that happen. There are things that are being planned" Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace when asked in an interview that aired on "Fox News Sunday" why he has not gone to war zones to see US troops and missed the cemetery visits. "We don't want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else." "I've had an unbelievable busy schedule and I will be doing it" Trump said adding that he doesn't think "anybody's been more with the military than I have as a president."Past presidents have visited troops in war zones at various points during their presidencies. Former President Barack Obama visited troops in Iraq a little over two months into his administration and Afghanistan after being in office for just over a year. Former President George W. Bush visited Iraq about eight months after the start of the war there. Trump also acknowledged in the interview that he should have gone to Arlington National Cemetery to mark Veterans Day on Monday. "I should have done that. I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling as you know" he told Wallace. "I probably you know in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year" Trump said. "But we had come in very later at night and I had just left literally the American cemetery in Paris and I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state doing other things." The President was referring to the trip he took last week to an American cemetery in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I. A day before the trip he was criticized for not attending a memorial with world leaders at another cemetery the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial in in Belleau France because of weather-related issues. In his interview with Wallace he defended that decision which he says was actually made by the Secret Service. "They said 'Sir' Secret Service said 'Sir you cannot go. We are not prepared. You cannot go.' Because it was supposed to be helicopter but the helicopter couldn't fly because of zero visibility" Trump said. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Victor Blackwell contributed reporting. ,U.S.
Tallahassee Florida  (CNN)Republican Gov. Rick Scott maintained a lead over Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in the Florida Senate race at the conclusion of a manual recount on Sunday signaling an end to the contest that carried on for days after election night. The results of the recount show Scott with a vote lead of 10033 over incumbent Nelson. Before the completion of the manual recount Scott had a lead of 12603 votes.Nelson will make a statement at 3 p.m. ET on Sunday his campaign announced. Nelson's campaign has led the charge on demanding Democrats use every available option to extend the statewide recount in Florida and challenge the state's voting laws in federal court. On Saturday however Nelson lost a partner in the recount fight when Mayor Andrew Gillum the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis a sign that Democrats in the state believe the fight is over.Nelson's race -- along with Gillum's contest and the state's race for agriculture commissioner -- went to a machine recount a week ago but the recount did not do nearly enough for Nelson and just further formalized Gov. Rick Scott's more than 12000-vote lead. The contest still fell within the .25% standard for a manual recount of contested ballots however.That manual recount ended when all of Florida's 67 counties submitted their final vote totals to the secretary of state by Sunday at noon meaning every vote deemed admissible by county canvassing boards and the courts was officially counted. Facing an insurmountable vote gap with Scott Sunday's deadline will surely bring an end to Nelson's bid barring further legal maneuvering. Despite Nelson's campaign -- led by lawyer Marc Elias -- being the muscle behind Democratic efforts to extend the recount the senator himself has done very little publicly appearing only a few times in taped videos and once with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in Washington.Elias did not respond to CNN's request for comment on whether he will challenge the vote count after the manual recount is finished.Democrats have long held out hope that a team of lawyers representing Democrats in the state could score enough legal victories to find enough votes to close the more than 12000-vote divide that Nelson faces in his re-election bid against Scott.But those legal victories have not come with Elias and his team of lawyers here in Tallahassee losing the bulk of their cases before Judge Mark Walker in federal court. Nelson's two most consequential losses came late in the week. In one Walker ruled that the guidelines Florida law provides to election canvassing boards on how to determine voter intent in a manual recount are constitutional; in the other Walker denied a request to stop the state of Florida from enforcing the vote-by-mail deadlines for domestic mail in ballots that were postmarked before the deadline but did not arrive at vote counting facilities until after Election Day.  ,U.S.
 (CNN)Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at Michelle Obama's book tour in Washington comparing himself to Jay-Z at a Beyoncé concert.The former president showed up with a bouquet of flowers during the promotional event for his wife's memoir "Becoming" in the nation's capital on Saturday night. "This is like - you know when Jay-Z comes out during the Beyoncé concert?  ... Like Crazy in Love?" he said referring to instances when the rapper appears at his wife's concerts during performances of her famous song. "It's the same thing. It's just a little sample to enhance the concert."When the former president appeared on stage an audience member yelled "we miss you!" as the crowd cheered. The event was moderated by former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. Michelle Obama talked about their life post-White House and how they are taking a step back to reflect on what they accomplished.  "We haven't had much time to reflect over these eight years because we were so busy doing and so busy trying to be perfect and to get everything right that rarely did we have time to sit back and acknowledge what we've donew" she said."And I was able to do that with my husband just the other night. And just look at him and say 'man man you did this. You did this. You did one of the hardest jobs on the planet.'"Before former President Obama took the stage his wife expressed frustration at today's heightened state of political discourse and said she sometimes wishes her husband would say something."There are so many times where I just want him -- like I know all of you - to just curse them out. Just say these things. And he's like 'well that's not the point. You know the president isn't the president for his own ego. The president is the president for the entire country. So we have to be very mindful of what we say and how we say it.'"Comparing her husband's administration to that of President Donald Trump Michelle Obama talked about the stark differences between the two. "We have a choice in what we decide to accept as a people" she said. "We're now living in an example of -- you've seen going high and you've seen going low. And the question that we have to ask ourselves is which feels better? You know what world do we want to live in? What world do we want our kids to grow up in?"The former first lady has made several references to Trump in her memoir. In the book she said she would "never forgive" him for his role in the "birther" conspiracy theory that falsely claimed her husband was not born in the United States. Trump's central role in pushing the falsehood put her family at risk she writes.Trump pushed back last week saying her accusations are meant to generate headlines.  "She got paid a lot of money to write a book and they always expect a little controversy" Trump said.,U.S.
Washington  (CNN)California Democrat Gil Cisneros has defeated Republican Young Kim in a closely watched House race adding yet another blue seat to the party's new House majority. Cisneros a former Navy officer will represent California's racially diverse 39th Congressional District which was previously held by retiring Republican Rep. Ed Royce. Kim who was seen as a charismatic potential successor to Royce her one-time boss finally succumbed to her opponent on Sunday.In a concession published to Facebook Kim said she believes that the "competitive nature of this election shows that my message and service to this community resonated."The Democratic win in the district adds to several other pickups for the party in the districts representing Orange County a place that used to be reliably Republican. Democrats now control seven seats representing the county four of which are pickups from Republicans.CNN's Kevin Bohn and Aaron Pellish contributed reporting. ,U.S.
Washington  (CNN)President Donald Trump said he declined to listen to a recording that captured part of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi calling it "a suffering tape" and "terrible."In an interview released on Sunday Trump told Fox News' Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" that he doesn't have any interest in hearing the tape which contains audio of the killing of Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul Turkey in early October. "Have you one either heard the tape yourself or been briefed on it and if so to your mind what does it show?" Wallace asked Trump."We have the tape I don't want to hear the tape no reason for me to hear the tape" Trump replied. "Why don't you want to hear it sir?" "Because it's a suffering tape it's a terrible tape" Trump said. "I've been fully briefed on it there's no reason for me to hear it in fact I said to the people 'should I?' They said 'you really shouldn't there's no reason.' I know exactly -- I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it.""It was very violent very vicious and terrible" Trump added. On Tuesday Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made similar comments to a Turkish newspaper calling the tape a "true disaster." Trump also said that he doesn't know if Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was lying when he denied having any involvement in the murder of Khashoggi a statement that conflicts with the CIA's assessment on Friday that bin Salman personally ordered the killing of the journalist. "I don't -- I don't know you know who could really know?" Trump said. "But I can say this: He's got many people now that say he had no knowledge." "Do you live with [bin Salman's statement] because you need him?" Wallace asked."Well will anybody really know?" answered Trump. "All right will anybody really know? But he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved" Trump said. "You saw we put on very heavy sanctions massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia" Trump continued. "But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good." CNN's Kevin Bohn and Sarah Westwood contributed reporting. ,U.S.
 (CNN)It was where "good Republicans go to die" Ronald Reagan often quipped.  Now with the final ballots counted Democrats have achieved a total takeover of congressional seats in the one-time Republican bastion of Orange County.Across the country on Election Day Democrats shifted the balance of power in the US House by capturing the college-educated suburbs once dominated by Republicans. But there is no pocket of America where the erosion in GOP support is more striking than Orange County. Laboring against a strong tide of disdain and even disgust for President Donald Trump Republicans lost their grip on the wealthy enclaves along the coast in northern Orange County that comprise the district held by 15-term Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. They lost by a much larger margin along the coast farther south in the district of retiring Rep. Darrell Issa which includes the San Clemente home where Richard Nixon holed up to write his memoirs after resigning from the White House.On the days leading up to Election Day GOP officials had been slightly more optimistic that they would hold the inland Orange County district represented by GOP Rep. Mimi Walters who had served as the deputy chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington. But Walters conceded to her rival UC-Irvine law professor and Elizabeth Warren protégé Katie Porter late last week after the latest batch of ballots counted by election officials made a GOP victory seem impossible.The last of the four seats to fall was California's racially-diverse 39th District in northern Orange County. Republican Young Kim an immigrant from South Korea who highlighted her family's journey to America was one of the GOP's best hopes for reflecting the growing diversity of a district that is more than a third Hispanic and 31% Asian. But Kim conceded to Democrat Gil Cisneros late Saturday night in their race for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce."We are seeing a realignment with college-educated voters and Orange County is ground zero for this phenomenon" said Sean Clegg a California-based Democratic strategist who advises US Sen. Kamala Harris and California Governor-Elect Gavin Newsom. "This election was a clear referendum on Trump and Trumpism and people want the reality show to end particularly suburban women."The Democrats' success in flipping all four seats from red to blue is a stunning development for a county that served as the North Star for Reagan-style conservatism. "The cataclysmic losses in Orange County are the manifestation of changing demographics that have been in motion for a couple decades. Trump has accelerated the political consequences the GOP" said Rob Stutzman a California-based Republican strategist noting that the lesser-known GOP candidate for governor John Cox is still winning the county by a slender margin according to the latest results posted by the Orange County Registrar of Voters.   "That's good evidence that the congressional losses are a Trump effect" said Stutzman. "The GOP can compete to win those seats back in two years and new district maps in 2022 will possibly yield a clear GOP seat. The 'Orange Curtain' has fallen but Republicans will still compete in Orange County for the next few election cycles. They'll be more likely to succeed without Trump on the ballot."Fred Smoller an associate professor of political science at Chapman University in Orange County noted that the GOP now has a 1% registration advantage in the county compared to a 22% advantage in 1990. "The Republican Party has taken a serious hit in Orange County but it has not collapsed" Smoller said in an email. "The congress folks who won -- Levin and Cisneros -- got their winning margins in San Diego and Los Angeles counties. (The Congressional districts overlap OC). Republicans control the Board of Supervisors the District Attorney's office Sheriff and most city councils."Still the sting of the losses was pronounced because of the region's history. Orange County was the place that fostered the conservative movement driven by the John Birch Society in the 1960s.Orange County activists powered the passage of Prop 13 which limited property taxes and later the passage of Prop 187 -- the 1994 ballot measure that would have barred immigrants from getting basic state services. That measure which was ultimately struck down by the courts irrevocably shifted Latinos in California toward the Democratic Party.This time Orange County voters revolted against the racially-tinged and misogynistic rhetoric of Trump. Well-liked incumbents like Walters labored against Trump's villainy of immigrants and the migrant caravan and his suggestion that he could alter birthright citizenship. Moreover the Republican tax bill became an albatross for Walters and Rohrabacher because of the way it altered state and local deductions -- a blow to homeowners in a county where the median home price is now beyond $715000. It remains to be seen whether Republican losses in the white-collar suburbs of Orange County mark the death knell of establishment Republicans or if the losses after Trump's hostile takeover of the party alter the calculus in 2020.But the possibility that "Orange is the new blue" as Newsom and his Democratic colleagues like to say marks a stunning transformation for the region and a chilling sign for the establishment wing of the Republicans Party.Reagan delighted in making his "good Republicans" quip at fundraisers before GOP donors.At one event where he made that joke in Anaheim in November 1986 the then-President also noted how essential Orange County had been to his own success (in his run for governor) and the success of the party."Everything we've accomplished since then in Sacramento and yes in Washington began with that margin of victory provided here in Orange County" Reagan said.After just one cycle of Trump -- and decades of demographic changes that weigh in Democrats' favor -- the Republican Party is now watching all that work unravel in the place where it began.,U.S.
 (CNN)Former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Sunday that while her opponent Republican Brian Kemp was the legal victor of the state governor's race she would not call him the legitimate winner.Abrams told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" that she thought there was deliberate interference in the election saying "it began eight years ago with the systematic disenfranchisement of more than a million voters. It continued with the underfunding and disinvestment in polling places in training and in the management of the county delivery of services. And I think it had its pinnacle in this race.""So yes there was a deliberate and intentional disinvestment and I think destruction of the administration of elections in the state of Georgia" Abrams added.The Georgia race has stoked a fierce new front in the national battle over voting rights and access to the polls. Kemp who as Georgia's recently resigned secretary of state promoted and enforced some of the nation's most restrictive voting laws was accused repeatedly before and during the campaign of seeking to suppress the minority vote.Abrams on Friday ended her bid to become the first African American woman elected to lead a state. The announcement followed more than a week of post-election legal maneuvering from her campaign and allies who sought to find enough votes to reduce Kemp's lead and force a December 4 runoff. In a fiery speech Abrams announced plans for a "major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for the gross mismanagement of this election and to protect future elections from unconstitutional actions."In a statement Friday Kemp said he appreciated Abrams' "passion hard work and commitment to public service.""The election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward. We can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia's bright and promising future" he said.Abrams continued to allege Kemp blocked eligible voters from voter rolls in her interview on Sunday. "Trust in our democracy relies on believing there are good actors who are making this happen and he was a horrible actor who benefited from his perfidy."When Tapper asked  Abrams whether Kemp was the legitimate governor-elect of Georgia she said she did "acknowledge the law as it stands" that he received sufficient votes."But we know sometimes the law does not do what it should and something being legal does not make it right" she added. "This is someone who has compromised our systems."When Tapper pressed her on not using the word "legitimate" Abrams replied "what's not right is saying that something was done properly when it was not.""I will never deny the legal imprimatur that says he is in this position and I pray for his success" she added. "But will I say that this election was not tainted was not a disinvestment and a disenfranchisement of thousands of voters? I will not say that."Tapper asked how her accusations differed from President Donald Trump's unfounded claims that there was interference in Florida's hotly contested Senate and governor's races."My accusations are based entirely on evidence" she said. "We had four different federal judges in the course of a week say that what we witnessed was wrong and forced better behavior. And what I'm simply asking for is another court to force even stronger behaviors legal reforms that will guarantee that no one has to question the legitimacy of our election.",U.S.
 (CNN)The passengers on the Lion Air 610 flight were on board one of Boeing's newest most advanced planes.The pilot and co-pilot of the 737 MAX 8 were more than experienced with around 11000 flying hours between them. The weather conditions were not an issue and the flight was routine.So what caused that plane to crash into the Java Sea just 13 minutes after takeoff?More than two weeks after the catastrophe investigators are still piecing together the clues.As they do the focus has turned to Boeing which allegedly failed to tell pilots about a new system feature implicated in the crash -- information that aviation analysts say could have possibly saved the lives of all 189 people on board.A lawsuit against Boeing related to the crash was filed Thursday. The parents of one passenger sued the company claiming that the downed plane a 737 MAX 8 had an unsafe design. The suit alleges Boeing failed to communicate a new safety feature that hadn't existed in previous 737s.Lion Air's operational director has accused Boeing of withholding information from pilots in the manuals about a safety feature that automatically lowers the airplane's nose to prevent or exit a stall.Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that information was available as part of the training manual.On Wednesday a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the company could not "discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation" and that the company had "provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.""We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing" the spokesperson said.CNN has spoken to nine aviation experts including pilots who fly the 737 MAX 8 planes about the crash. While they all emphasized that only a complete investigation will give a full picture of what actually happened in the cockpit that morning all have concluded that in one way or another Boeing's actions fell short -- leaving not only the families of the victims shaken but also the aviation industry.Boeing declined to comment for this article referring CNN to its most recent statement cited above.A faceliftIn recent years Lion Air the popular Indonesian budget carrier had given itself a makeover.The privately owned carrier was the first airline to put Boeing's 737 MAX 8 -- a more efficient and environmentally friendly upgrade of a jet introduced in 1967 -- into service. According to Boeing the Max jets are said to be 10% to 12% more efficient than their predecessors.In 2011 Lion Air announced a $21.7 billion order for 230 of the single-aisle twin-engine jets -- the largest single order for commercial jets in its history at the time according to Boeing. Lion Air became the first airline to put the 737 MAX 8 into service and later started buying more versions -- the 9 and larger 10 in a $6.24 billion deal this year.Those upgrades may have signaled a bid by Lion Air to rectify its spotty safety record over the last decade including a 2013 non-fatal crash and a ban from European and US airspace between 2007 and 2016. The European and US bans have since been lifted with the international civil aviation organization giving the airline its top rating in terms of safety this year. The MAX 8s have been a visible part of that boost.But with any new fleet pilots must undergo additional training."Generally speaking when there is a new delivery of aircraft -- even though they are the same family -- airline operators are required to send their pilots for training" Bijan Vasigh professor of economics and finance at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University told CNN.Those training sessions generally take only a few days but they give the pilots time to familiarize themselves with any new features or changes to the system Vasigh said.One of the MAX 8's new features is an anti-stalling device the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS). If the MCAS detects that the plane is flying too slowly or steeply and at risk of stalling it can automatically lower the airplane's nose.It's meant to be a safety mechanism. But the problem according to Lion Air and a growing chorus of international pilots was that no one knew about that system. Zwingli Silalahi Lion Air's operational director said that Boeing did not suggest additional training for pilots operating the 737 MAX 8. "We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots" Zwingli told CNN Wednesday."We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 MAX 8. That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation" he said.Investigators are examining whether an angle of attack (AOA) sensor on the outside of the Lion Air plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the MCAS to force the plane's nose down.  An AOA sensor is an instrument similar to a small wind vane that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.Investigators said that the day before the crash the jet experienced problems with its AOA sensor which was replaced. The last four flights -- including crucially the flight that crashed according to Soerjanto Tjahjono the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) also had problems. On Wednesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Southwest Airlines a US carrier that also has a fleet of MAX 8 planes replaced two malfunctioning AOA sensors during the three weeks before the Lion Air crash. CNN has asked Boeing for a copy of the original manuals issued to carriers who bought the Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing has not provided those operation manuals to CNN. Representatives from American United and Southwest airlines have all told CNN that Boeing did not include information in its Flight Crew Operations Manual that explained the functions of the new feature.Lion Air's flight manual did not contain information about the new system according to Reuters which has seen the manual.CNN has reviewed updated guidance issued by Boeing on November 6 and a subsequent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) emergency directive that reinforced Boeing's update on November 7.'Doomed'Mary Schiavo a CNN aviation analyst and the former inspector general of the United States Department of Transportation said that one of the selling points of the Boeing 737 fleet is that pilots can move from one plane to another easily if they are already trained on one of the jets.The fact that Boeing could have failed to include the proper guidance on the new manual could have been an oversight she said. She also said that updating a manual can be a long process for manufacturers and airlines.It's possible that Boeing could have downplayed the changes to the system as a selling point according to Schiavo who added that she hoped the error was an "innocent" one.Boeing likely "assumed it would save the plane when it looks like it might have doomed the plane" she added.A Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) emergency directive sent to all MAX 8 operators on November 7 explained that pilots can stop a malfunctioning automated system on those planes by pressing two buttons. The FAA bulletin said that all carriers were to revise their manuals within three days. "This condition if not addressed could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane and lead to excessive nose-down attitude significant altitude loss and possible impact with terrain" it said.Automated systems are known to occasionally malfunction but trained pilots will know how to counteract those systems. Not sharing that information Schiavo said is another matter.If pilots were unaware of a new feature -- or how to shut it off if it malfunctions -- they would be set up for failure she said."All these improvements they (Boeing) market as more efficient and safe. To do that without the training on how to turn it off... I think that the investigators and the reports ... will find it was not an excusable mistake" she said referencing another flight the 2003 Colgan Air 9446 crash where the aircraft also experienced a full trim nose down and was unable to recover.There's no way of being able to physically overcome the strength it takes to counteract a full nose stop down she said estimating the weight at around 800 pounds of force in the 2003 Colgan Air crash noting that it was a much smaller regional plane where the pilots were not fighting a computer."I think the industry the pilot's union -- everyone is so stunned that the plane could do this and that the pilots weren't trained to turn it off knowing it could be a fatal dive" Schiavo said.Richard Aboulafia vice president of analysis at the aerospace and defense consulting company Teal Group Corporation told CNN that he couldn't imagine that Boeing would intentionally leave out important information to pilots just to get a competitive edge over its industry rival.  "I really can't imagine that being the case because the system doesn't really require a lot of extra training -- frankly (adding) just an extra page in the book would have sufficed. So the idea that they did it for competitive reasons I just don't get that" Aboulafia said.Instead he believes that it's possible that it might have been an oversight or a "technical error." Aboulafia says that it's "encouraging" that pilots are voicing their concerns as their feedback helps keep the industry safe."If I were a consumer I would feel happy that the pilots were making their voices heard. And happy that there was cooperation between manufacturers and regulatory authorities and between the airlines and the pilots -- it's exactly that process that's made the system what it is over the past century of aviation. It's a very healthy triangle of people who communicate and you are seeing that unfold right now as we speak."Unaware of safety featuresDennis Tajer is one of those pilots who has flown the 737 MAX 8 planes. The veteran 737 captain for American Airlines who is a spokesperson for its 15000 member pilot union the Allied Pilots Association (APA) told CNN the first time he learned about the MCAS safety feature was through a bulletin issued by Boeing on November 6. The company said the bulletin was meant to reinforce procedures already in the 737 MAX flight manual. The APA rejects that claim. Tajer said Boeing broke his trust the key component of a safety culture that he has been an active part of for over 10 years."When you are describing components of the aircraft that we had no idea that existed that's what's troubling" Tajer said of his first read of that bulletin."We want to know about the new system -- and you are using the cloak of the stabilizer checklist (another related system) to describe things to which I had no knowledge existed" he said.   Tajer imagines what it might have been like for the Lion Air pilots who he believes were also unaware of the new system and would have been struggling to understand what was going in the cockpit."They are human beings that are trying to process just what the heck was going on. Like a crowd of 10 people yelling at them while a nefarious and insidious system they had no idea was running on the airplane is actually running against you."But not all pilots are pointing the finger at Boeing. This week the Seattle Times reported that the chairman of the United Airlines pilots union which is represented by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said that although the original 737 MAX 8 manual did not specify the new safety system it did include steps on how to shut down the "flight-control behavior it induces." Capt. Todd Insler ALPA's chairman of the United branch said that Lion Air pilots should have been aware of that procedure and that it was too soon to say anything more about the cause of the Lion Air crash. "The story here is not why we didn't know about (the new system) it's why the pilots didn't fly the plane" Insler said.In a letter sent by the ALPA President Capt. Tim Canoll to the FAA and the US National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday the ALPA said they were "concerned that a potential significant aviation system safety deficiency exists" and asked for "immediate help and assistance in clarifying the issues with respect to the pitch control system of the aircraft."It added: "More importantly...reports indicate that information regarding the normal and non-normal operation of this system was not provided to the frontline airline employees -- the flight crews and maintenance technicians."Veteran pilot and author Patrick Smith who does not fly 737 MAX planes told CNN that it's too soon to determine what could have gone wrong but that it's possible to say that an alleged system malfunction isn't entirely to blame.On Smith's blog "Ask a Pilot" he wrote: "Is it too big a step to say that this system and its apparent malfunction were entirely to blame? Is there not some basic seat-of-the-pants airmanship skills that the pilots could have or should have fallen back on? If the plane was nosing over should they not have suspected something was askew with the stabilizers or stabilizer trim and disconnected power to those controls? Well that's easy to ask when sitting safely in front of a keyboard days later. The truth is we don't know exactly what they were dealing with -- the sights the sounds the sensations -- in that cockpit as it was all going to hell." Both Smith and Tajer believe though that as dark and horrific as the Lion Air crash was it has compelled the industry to face difficult questions and push for more transparency and positive learning outcomes with passengers' safety at the helm.Tajer says that now his trust in the company is slowly rebuilding and that MAX 8 pilots aren't flying with hesitation now because they have broken through the "sound barrier" of information."We won't fly an airplane that's not safe we've got our customers' backs."Aboulafia agrees that there is no reason for consumers to be concerned about what could be a freak incident adding that technological advances in the industry over the last century have demonstrated that flying is "now the safest form of transportation ever designed in the history of mankind.""We don't know the full details of this crash yet but as for other systems have never been safer" Aboulafia said.Schiavo is a bit more cautious."I personally would avoid the 737 MAX until there is time for the pilots to be retrained" she said. "I like my pilots to know how to troubleshoot in the air."Boeing which made no comment on the allegations said it was "deeply saddened by the loss of Lion Air Flight JT 610." "We extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families and loved ones of those on board."Automation as collaborationThe Lion Air crash has again reignited a larger conversation about the use of automated control systems and whether cockpit procedures surrounding these systems are as safe as they should be.It's the latest fatal crash involving an auto flight control system. Both the Air France 447 and AirAsia Flight 8501 crashes had flight-control systems and pilots working against each other with disastrous outcomes begging the question of whether these systems help or hinder pilots.Peter Goetz a CNN aviation analyst and former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board believes that ultimately the onus is on transparency and training and not on automation."Pilots are extraordinarily skilled and if they have the right training and information they will make the right decisions they will do the right thing. But if they don't know what's confronting them and there's been an increasing reliance on the infallibility of fly-by-wire systems then you are faced with a real challenge.

He says that technology has definitely increased the safety of our global flight systems but just like a singular dietary plan it's not always healthy."Automation is an outstanding addition to the aircraft when it's in collaboration" Tajer said."But when you don't tell the human about it it disconnects the human being from the system.",World
 (CNN)Mohammed Ali al-Houthi a leader of the Houthi movement announced on Sunday that he is ready to institute a ceasefire so long as the Saudi-led coalition battling his militia in Yemen is prepared to do the same."We are willing to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts to reach a just and honorable peace if they really want peace for the Yemeni people" al-Houthi head of Yemen's Houthi Supreme Revolutionary Committee said in a statement.Al-Houthi also said that his forces would stop launching missiles and drone attacks on "US-Saudi aggression countries and their allies in Yemen." The United States has backed the Saudi-led coalition in its fight to expel Iranian-aligned Houthis from the Gulf country.In a gesture of goodwill al-Houthi called on Houthi forces to refrain from attacks."We announce our initiative and call on the official Yemeni (Houthi) authorities to stop the firing of missiles and unmanned aircrafts on the US-Saudi aggression countries and their allies in Yemen to drop any justification for their continued aggression or siege" he said.On October 30 US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and the US State Department called on the participants in the conflict in Yemen to agree to a ceasefire "in the next 30 days.""Thirty days from now we want to see everybody around a peace table based on a ceasefire based on a pullback from the border and then based on ceasing dropping of bombs that will permit the (UN) special envoy Martin Griffiths -- he's very good he knows what he's doing -- to get them together in Sweden and end this war" Mattis said at an event at the US Institute of Peace in Washington.His call was later echoed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who issued a statement saying "The United States calls on all parties to support UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen.""Substantive consultations under the UN Special Envoy must commence this November in a third country" Pompeo added.Mattis said the talks should lead to the implementation of "confidence-building measures to address the underlying issues of the conflict the demilitarization of borders and the concentration of all large weapons under international observation."The Trump administration has been criticized by activists and some members of Congress for its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen and for the administration's recent finding that the coalition wasn't doing enough to avoid civilian casualties.Earlier this month the US announced that it would no longer refuel Saudi aircraft conducting strike missions over Yemen. The move was expected to have minimal impact on the Saudi effort because the United States was only providing refueling for some 20% of Saudi aircraft.The US military also provides the Saudi coalition with training meant to help minimize civilian casualties as well as with intelligence to help guard against Houthi cross-border missile and drone attacks.Last week the Saudi-led coalition agreed to the evacuation of wounded Houthi fighters from Yemen the British Foreign Office said hailing it as a breakthrough toward getting a new round of peace talks. The announcement was made following a visit of Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to discuss the ongoing conflict.David Miliband the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee had called Pompeo's statement "the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen for four years.""It is vital that this call for a ceasefire is followed through and the call for support for the political process heeded" Miliband added.The conflict which began in early 2015 has sparked a humanitarian crisis.  Eight million people are on the brink of famine according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. UN officials say that number may quickly rise to more than 12 million -- about half of Yemen's population -- unless the fighting stops.,World
 (CNN)A teenage German driver has fractured her spine after suffering a horrifying airborne crash at Macau Grand Prix's Formula Three final on Sunday.In dramatic video footage which has been shared on social media Sophia Floersch -- who is only 17 years old -- can be seen losing control of her Van Amersfoort Racing car and flying over her competitors before slamming into the track fence.On Twitter Floersch thanked everyone for the messages of support."Just wanted to let everybody know that I am fine but will be going into Surgery tomorrow morning" she wrote adding that there will be an update soon.In a medical report published by Van Amersfoort Racing it says Floersch is conscious and suffered a spinal fracture as a result of the terrifying accident in the Chinese territory.The medical report added that Floersch is "not fit to race."The governing body of motor sport the FIA also published a statement on Facebook which said that Japan's Sho Tsuboi -- whose car Floersch collided with -- had also been taken to a local hospital for "further evaluation" as well as two members of the media and one marshal.,World
Moscow (CNN)A forum representing Russian military veterans took an unusual step Sunday by voting to ask the International Criminal Court to probe the Russian government's use of private military contractors in deployments abroad.The veterans agreed to submit an appeal to Fatou Bensouda the prosecutor at The Hague-based court over Russian civilians being used as private military contractors in hotspots around the globe. The conflict zones include Syria Libya sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Ukraine.The Russian government officially does not acknowledge using private military contractors to advance foreign-policy and mercenary activity is prohibited by law. But earlier this year after US airstrikes killed and injured dozens of Russian military contractors in Syria the families of some of the dead began to come forward creating a public-relations conundrum for the Kremlin.Dmitry Potapenko a participant in the veteran's forum said the market for private military companies in Russia has grown significantly over the past few years. But he said it exists in a "legal gray area" as long as the government refuses to acknowledge their activities."There are more private military companies in Russia now" he said. "Unless we define the legal status of these people and unless we get rid of this official-level hypocrisy the number of PMCs will not go down. Any state has special operations it tries to carry out. It's normal practice."It's unclear if the ICC an intergovernmental organization that investigates war crimes would review the appeal. But by appealing to the ICC the forum organizers say they hope to lift secrecy about the use of military contractors -- and bring them out of that legal gray area.'Private military companies do not exist' state saysEvgeny Shabayev the leader of a paramilitary organization known as the Khovrino Cossack Society has been the most visible activist in calling for social benefits and better legal protections for Russia's private military contractors. Shabayev has been a representative for paramilitary fighters in eastern Ukraine. He told CNN the Russian government insists that no private military companies exist in Russia."We've opened a full-fledged discussion with the state. We sent our requests to every authority" he said. "You know we are people of order so we officially sent our motions and every single authority came with an answer: 'Private military companies do not exist in the Russian Federation they are not engaging in this sort of activities and those who have served for PMCs are state criminals.' "After the US airstrike on the advancing Russian mercenaries in February 2018 some of the contractors were returned to Moscow with severe injuries. Shabayev visited wounded friends and comrades the hospital in Moscow and spoke to CNN at the time. He said the injuries were extremely severe but insisted that none of the mercenaries would talk to media because of the illegal nature of their work abroad and fear of Kremlin reprisals.At a press conference Shabayev said veterans were left with no alternative."We are demanding because we've done enough pleading" he said.An open secretIt's long been an open secret that Russia employs private contractors to advance foreign policy. In Syria the private military company Wagner has hundreds of contractors on the ground supporting both the Russian military and pro-regime forces.Wagner's activities have come under international and media scrutiny. In 2017 the US Treasury Department sanctioned Wagner for recruiting and sending soldiers to fight along separatists in eastern Ukraine. More recently three Russian journalists who were investigating the activities of Wagner in the Central African Republic were killed in what authorities describe as an ambush.The incident in CAR cast additional spotlight on the scope of Russian mercenary activity abroad. In its appeal the veterans' group said that Russian private military and security companies were operating in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine Syria Libya the CAR Gabon Sudan and South Sudan Yemen and other countries in Asia and Africa.The Russian Foreign Ministry refers questions on private military contractors to the Russian military. The Russian Defense Ministry does not officially acknowledge companies such Wagner are in Syria. The Russian Foreign Ministry and Russian military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday's forum.The veterans say they seek to pressure the Russian government to change the laws -- and bring the activities of private military companies out of the shadows."We have families who lost their loved ones in this and haven't received any compensation social insurance that the state should've provided them with. We have wounded people who cannot receive treatment this on such a massive scale now" Shabayev said. "And this is one of the reasons why we are almost screaming about this in public." This story was reported by Mary Ilyushina and Nathan Hodge in Moscow and Sebastian Shukla in London.,World
 (CNN)For the first time in its 25-year history the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit ended Sunday with its leaders failing to agree on a formal joint statement.All 21 APEC leaders at the annual meeting in Papua New Guinea were in agreement except China a source within the meeting told CNN.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed late Sunday that disagreements on trade stood in the way of a final statement."There are differing visions on particular elements" Trudeau said.China may have been concerned about a specific line about unfair trade practices according to a US official involved in the negotiations.The official said the most "problematic" line for the Chinese was: "We agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.""They seemed to think that the 'unfair trade practices' was some kind of singling out" the official contended. "It's a little concerning that it appears that China didn't really have any intention in the end of reaching consensus" the official said.The trade war between the US and China was at the forefront during speeches by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday.Xi spoke of the need for global cooperation and trade and said all differences could be bridged "through consultation." "History has shown that confrontation whether in the form of a cold war a hot war or a trade war will produce no winners" Xi said to applause.But Pence said Washington wouldn't ease the trade war with Beijing until it "changes its ways.""China has taken advantage of the United States for many many years and those days are over" Pence told the gathering in Port Moresby.The Trump administration has levied tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase to 25% from 10% on January 1 which would further escalate the conflict.China has so far retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase at the start of January.Pence also knocked China for loans to developing countries in the Pacific and beyond."The terms of those loans are often opaque at best. Projects they support are often unsustainable and of poor quality. Too often they come with strings attached and lead to staggering debt... The United States deals openly fairly. We do not offer a constricting belt or a one-way road" he said mocking China's One Belt One Road initiative.China's Foreign Ministry lashed out at Pence for his remarks."Our advice for the relevant country is that instead of pointing fingers at others it would be better to match its deeds with its words and truly treat all countries big or small as equals" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement."Not a single developing country has been mired in debt difficulties because of its cooperation with China. On the contrary their cooperation with China has helped them enhance their capacity for self-driven development and improved their people's livelihood" Hua said about Pence's allegations on loans.US admiral: 'Great Wall of SAMs'Further fanning the flames Pence announced the US would partner with Australia and Papua New Guinea to develop a naval base on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.Pence did not give details of the development of the base but the announcement comes as Washington is trying counter a substantial Chinese military buildup in the South China Sea and beyond.Most of the region's attention was focused on Port Moresby. The US military commander in the Pacific speaking at a conference in Canada accused China's military of "a sustained campaign to intimidate other nations in the East and South China Seas" by fortifying manmade islands."What was a 'Great Wall of Sand' just three years ago is now a 'Great Wall of SAMs' (surface-to-air missiles) in the South China Sea" Adm. Phil Davidson told the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia.Davidson said the islands and the armaments on them give Beijing "the potential to exert national control over international waters and airspace through which over $3 trillion in goods travel every year along with commercial air traffic."China says its installations on the South China Sea islands are necessary to protect its territory and has criticized repeated US naval and air operations near the islands."Some countries which are outside of the region ignore China's firm opposition and conduct reconnaissance in the name of 'freedom of navigation' show off military power threaten China's sovereignty and the safety of Chinese stationed staff which could easily cause marine and air accidents and damage regional peace and stability" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement sent to CNN in August.But Davidson said it was China that posed a threat to sovereign rights with military intimidation."They're now violating the sovereignty of every other nation's ability to fly sail and operate in accordance with international law" Davidson said.

 (CNN)The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to rise as violence hampers health workers' efforts to battle the virus.There are now 358 cases of Ebola and 213 deaths since the outbreak began in August according to the nation's Ministry of Health. Conflict between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas.Operations suspendedOn Friday evening an armed group tried to attack UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni in North Kivu province -- the epicenter of the outbreak.The attack occurred near the Ebola Response Emergency Operations Center and hotels where many Ebola health workers are staying according to the health ministry. The peacekeepers were able to push the attackers back after several hours of clashes but all field activities were suspended in Beni Saturday due to the violence. The Emergency Operations Center remained closed and teams had to stay in their hotels.Earlier in the week at least seven peacekeepers were killed and 10 others were wounded in a coordinated military attack on rebel forces the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo said.The peacekeeping outfit has partnered with Congolese armed forces in an operation to dislodge the rebel Allied Democratic Forces and "restore peace and stability in the Beni area" the UN said in a statement. Deadly violence in the Congo's North Kivu province has hampered efforts to stamp out the Ebola virus the country's Minister of Public Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga said.Infants among deadThe outbreak -- the second this year -- began in North Kivu province before spreading to Ituri province in the east of the country. This is the 10th time since 1976 that Ebola has struck the Congo.Of all the reported cases 311 so far have been confirmed as Ebola and 47 are probable. Among the deaths 166 are confirmed as having been caused by Ebola and 47 are probable according to the nation's health ministry.Among those killed in the outbreak are pregnant and breastfeeding women newborns and infants the World Health Organization reported. More than 30 health workers also have been infected according to the WHO.Fear of spreadCongo shares borders with nine nations and the United Nations fears the Ebola epidemic could spread to South Sudan as well due to the influx of Congolese refugees.Doctors Without Borders is on the ground in the Congo and has also deployed teams to neighboring Uganda though no cases have been confirmed there so far. Still the World Health Organization said Thursday that "the risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as to neighboring countries remains very high."Kalenga the health minister posted a video on the Health Ministry's Facebook page early Saturday calling for communities to be vigilant and report any signs of illness. "Community-based surveillance is at the heart of the new response strategy against #Ebola. Each inhabitant at his level can protect his family and neighborhood against the virus by reporting any alert and suspicious cases to emergency teams. All the leaders of the #beni neighborhoods work alongside us in the response" he wrote.The virusEbola first appeared in 1976 in Sudan and Congo and gets its name from a river in the latter nation. It is one of the world's most virulent diseases and is transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected people.Ebola causes fever severe headaches and in some cases hemorrhaging. It spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated by someone ill with the disease. In some cases the virus is spread through contact with someone who has died from the disease. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes nose or mouth. It can also spread through sexual contact.,World
 (CNN)A US Navy sailor was serving as an exchange officer onboard the Norwegian naval frigate that was struck by a freighter and has now almost entirely sunk according to the US. Navy and the Norwegian Ministry of Defense. The Norwegian government's Accident Investigation Board is investigating the incident and the US has been informed that the American sailor may be part of that investigation. The sailor has not been identified and his exact role on the ship is unknown. A large hole was torn into the side of KNM Helge Ingstad when it collided with a Malta-registered oil tanker Sola TS in the early hours of November 8.The frigate one of five in the Scandinavian country's navy had been moving around inner fjords in western Norway for navigation training before it collided with the 250-meter long tanker (820 feet) that was sailing out of an oil terminal.While military crew reportedly drove the vessel up on underwater rocks to prevent it from sinking the tanker emerged relatively unscathed.But efforts to move the 5500-ton warship to a safe place went catastrophically wrong this week after cables attached to hold it in place snapped.Now all that remains above the waterline is the frigate's top antennas and radar leading local media to speculate how a ship designed for war failed to avoid a slow-moving 150000-ton tanker.AnnKristin Salbuvik a spokesperson for Norway's Ministry of Defense said the American officer was onboard Helge Ingstad as a part of an exchange program between the two countries' navies. Cmdr. Kyle Raines of the US Navy's 6th Fleet said in a statement: "The US Navy has an officer assigned to the Personnel Exchange Program (PEP)  with Norway as part of the crew of the KNM Helge Ingstad. "Because of privacy interests we are not at liberty to identify this officer by name."The Washington Post first reported the sailor could face questioning. Avoidable errorsNorway's military has remained tight lipped about the situation which injured eight of the 137 people on board. Navy communications officer Torill Herland told CNN that whatever occurred during the accident near Bergen is now "police work."A joint Norwegian and Maltese investigation is now also underway to try to determine the cause.Similar cases involving US Navy destroyers over the last two years were found to have been down to avoidable errors according to Alex Pape Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships but he said it is too early to speculate on this incident."Warships particularly surface combatants like frigates are generally designed to withstand a degree of battle damage" Pape told CNN."However even for well protected warships if they sustain sufficient damage particularly in adjacent compartments and below the waterline the resulting flooding may be too much for pumps and/or the crew's damage control efforts to cope with and the ship will list capsize or sink.Pape said this particular incident suggests that in addition to a visible large hole torn in the starboard side there is substantial damage to the hull near or below the waterline which then rapidly flooded the aft compartments of the ship.Heavy chainsThe attempted rescue of the frigate has certainly raised eyebrows.Jan Vindenes is the general manager of Sotra Anchor & Chain whose products have been used in numerous shipwreck recoveries including that of the Costa Concordia -- the cruise ship which crashed into rocks off the coast of Italy in 2012 killing 32 people on board. He thinks chains could have been used to secure the frigate."They used some wire to secure the frigate but unfortunately it snapped. We say that chain is stronger and better than wire.""We have chain that can hold 2000 tons and our chain was used to raise the Costa Concordia which was very much bigger than this frigate" he added.A costly crashGiven that the frigate is one of only five operated by the Norwegian navy its loss is likely to impact on national and NATO operations. But the country's military will have to carefully consider the cost of salvaging and repairing it for active service.Pape told CNN: "Curiously if the ship is not repaired the reduction of one ship that needs to be maintained upgraded manned and used over the remaining 20 years of its life will mean that cost for the navy could go down in the long run however with a loss of capability."Pape estimates that a decision to salvage it repair it and return it to service would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. "The total cost could be similar to the cost of a new ship."The financial impact of the crash is likely to be felt well beyond the military as it triggered the shutdown of a North Sea crude export terminal Norway's largest gas processing plant and several offshore fields.In total these five oil and gas fields produce around 400 million Norwegian krone ($48 million) a day or 17 million krone ($2 million) an hour. Since the oil companies pay 78 percent taxes to the state for production the two-day shutdown ultimately resulted in a substantial economic loss for the nation national broadcaster NRK reported.Fortunately the oil tanker -- which was carrying almost 100 million liters of oil -- was not seriously damaged in the accident. The Norwegian Coastal Administration said it had cleaned up some diesel and helicopter fuel that was spilled in the incident but that has been largely contained according to Truls Gulowsen head of Greenpeace in Norway."A major leakage would have constituted an unbelievable environmental disaster that easily could have impacted most of Norway's western coastline" Gulowsen told CNN.The crash led to a small amount of diesel and 10000 liters of helicopter fuel to leak from the vessel which has largely been contained and recovered he said.Gulowsen added however that "the situation is not yet stable and the vessel is still under water. The frigate had additional 385000 liters of marine diesel but this has not leaked"The Norwegian Navy is now considering ways to raise the vessel according to the military's chief of staff Admiral Nils Andreas Stensones."It's very hard for a navy to lose a vessel" he told AFP.,World
Paris (CNN)A protester was accidentally run over and killed by a car during a demonstration over rising fuel prices a top official in eastern France said Saturday. Mass demonstrations causing roadblocks across the country are part of the "gilets jaunes" or "yellow vests" movement which opposes mounting gas prices and eco-taxes on polluting forms of transport. The death occurred when a driver "panicked" and ran over someone after arriving at a blockade for an undeclared protest not far from the city of Lyon Louis Laugier the prefect of the Savoie region said at a news conference.A further 227 people were injured -- six severely -- in protests across the country and 73 people were taken into police custody the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Five police officers suffered slight injuries and one was severely injured. Another five gendarmes were hurt as well. Speaking about the death French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said: "That's the reason why we were worried to have people (who are) not experienced organizing protests."Ecology Minister François de Rugy called on citizens to "respect caution and safety recommendations" in order for protests to go ahead "without a new tragedy" in a tweet Saturday. He also offered his condolences to the family of the victim.More than 1 million people were expected to turn out Saturday for demonstrations across the country. Partway through the day the numbers were much lower than that.About 280000 people participated in more than 2000 demonstrations the Interior Ministry said."Honestly we're satisfied even if it's true we are not hundreds of thousands people here but still people have come. The day is not over yet and we're glad that there are no incidents here" Thierry Paul Valette who helped organize a protest on the Champs Elysées in Paris told CNN."We can't stand Macron's taxes any more. It's too much. We couldn't make ourselves heard through political parties or trade unions so we had to do something."The protest was billed as likely to be one of the toughest tests yet of Emmanuel Macron's 18-month-old presidency.Website blocage17novembre said protests were planned in all 95 of France's mainland departments while a petition on change.org calling on the French government to lower the cost of fuel has gotten more than 850000 signatures.In addition to concerns over spiraling fuel prices the protests also reflect long-running tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.Price hikeDiesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69) even hitting 1.53 euros in October according to UFIP France's oil industry federation. The price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil with Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October. French protesters are however not directing their anger at OPEC for reducing oil production or at the US administration for implementing tariffs on Iran crippling its oil exports. Macron is instead bearing the brunt of widespread French discontent with many protesters furious at the current leader's extension of environmental policies implemented under François Hollande's government. Notably taxes were increased by 8 centimes last January on diesel and by 4 centimes on petrol. Tax on diesel will also increase by another 6.4 centimes in 2019 and by 2.9 centimes for petrol. These rises follow many decades of under-taxation of diesel in France. Macron criticizedThe growing resentment has also been a springboard for partisan political attacks with opponents of Macron's centrist En Marche party attempting to energize their bases to fuel further revolt. "This government hasn't understood the anger of the French" Olivier Faure head of the French Socialist Party said Wednesday. "Macron has not heard the French" Laurent Wauquiez leader of the center-right party Les Républicains added in an interview for BFMTV and RMC radio. Meanwhile Macron's former nemesis Marine Le Pen leader of France's far-right National Rally said: "We were the first party to express our total support for this movement." Castaner hit back at Macron's opponents branding the protests "political" and accusing Les Républicains of being behind them. "It's a political protest with the Republicans behind it and it's irrational because the rising taxes have been compensated by the decline in the oil market" he told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. "We hear the protests we hear the anger I know the situation but we have to explain that it's essential that we exit fossil fuels."  The minister said police would be present to break up any dangerous roadblocks. "I am asking for the roads to not be completely blocked" Castaner said. "Where there is a roadblock -- which means there's a risk for emergency services -- there will be police." Macron struck a more conciliatory tone in an interview Wednesday saying: "I hear the anger and it's a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it." He nevertheless admitted that he was "wary because many different people are trying to piggyback on this movement." Prime Minister Edouard Philippe also announced close to 500 million euros in aid to low-income motorists in a key concession Wednesday.CNN's Eva Tapiero reported from Paris while Matthew Robinson and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

 (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel is making the most of her remaining time in office.  This week she made an uncharacteristically lively speech to EU parliament in Strasbourg and though she had stated many of the ideas before this time she was much more bold in outlining what she hopes will be a stronger more integrated EU.  "We should work on the vision to one day create a true European army" she told the chamber giving her full backing to one of many eurozone reforms called for by French President Emmanuel Macron.  She also had a dig at the nationalist policies of US President Donald Trump saying: "The times that we could rely on others without reservation are over.  That means we Europeans have to take our destiny into our hands if we want to survive as a community."She received a standing ovation for her speech -- and a few jeers.  At one point she grinned at MEPs and said: "I'm really enjoying this! I seem to be annoying a few people here today!"For a supposedly lame duck the Chancellor was in fine form.As her potential successors jockey for position before the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party conference next month Merkel is free to focus on securing her legacy. To do that she also needs to ensure that she's not pushed out before her time is up in 2021. So far she has the support of Wolfgang Schauble her former finance minister current Bundestag President and also the eminence gris of the CDU.    "She's taken the right decision at the right time" Schauble told Deutsche Welle's Tim Sebastian after her announcement. "Once elected as chancellor you can only be thrown out without your own agreement if there is a majority in parliament who elects another chancellor. That's unthinkable cannot be imagined in this parliament. So her position is constitutionally strong." The public seems to support that view.  An Infratest dimap poll released Thursday showed that 56% of respondents want Merkel to stay for the remaining three years in office before the next general election. Her decision to step down may have also contributed to a drop in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) rendering irrelevant its key demand for Merkel to resign.For the last week Merkel has been using her public speeches to rally support for the EU as it faces multiple crises from Brexit to Italy's budget defiance. In Strasbourg she gave a pointed warning to the Italian government:  "Whoever tries to resolve problems by just taking on more debt while ignoring previous commitments is placing the fundamentals of stability and strength that underpin the euro into doubt" she said.But Merkel is also sounding the alarm that increasing nationalism is threatening democracy and the liberal world order that underpins the EU. Last week she chose to speak out at the memorial for Kristallnacht or the "Night of Broken Glass" the 1938 rampage of state-sponsored violence by the Nazi regime that targeted Jewish communities and resulted in widespread looting and destruction of Jewish properties across Germany and Austria.  "There are two urgent questions that we need to answer" she said at Berlin's Rykestrasse Syangogue one of the 1400 synagogues that was set ablaze that night. "First what did we really learn from the Holocaust this rupture of civilization?  And second to the first question:  Are our democratic institutions sufficiently strong so that an increase of anti-Semitism or even if a majority presents anti-Semitism can it be prevented in the future?"She continued: "We must not allow our societies to be divided into us and them we and them we versus others. Every man has the right and can claim to be seen as an individual by the state. Secondly democracy is the best of all feasible social systems.  Even though life in a democracy may well be complicated on occasion. Democracy is more than to ensure majorities. It relies on balance. On a balance between majority and minority -- between government and opposition. It relies on the division of powers." Merkel also warned that some segments of society were feeling left behind and looking to populist leaders offering "simple answers" and a "brutalization of language."On Friday the Chancellor turned to the domestic task of healing the rifts in German society. Specifically she traveled to the eastern town of Chemnitz where the stabbing of a local man in August triggered spontaneous violent demonstrations against Merkel and her migration policy by right-wing extremists. Merkel answered questions from local residents at a town hall alongside the mayor of Chemnitz but for some of her critics it was too little too late. They pointed out that it took three months for Merkel to visit the town.    "I am a polarizing figure I know that" she said explaining that she did not want to escalate tensions in the city earlier. "I did not want to come here in such heated moments."But only a few hundred came out to demonstrate against the Chancellor far fewer than in previous protests. Merkel stayed for more than an hour patiently answering questions from a selected group of local residents. She admitted Germany's decision to welcome more than a million refugees between 2015 and 2016 was not organized in a way the public approved of and acknowledged a number of high-profile crimes committed by asylum seekers. She also agreed that political decisions needed to be more transparent to the public.One woman angrily confronted Merkel about her famous phrase "We can do it" which was designed to bolster the country in the midst of the 2015 refugee influx: "What about finding an answer to the chaos to this so-called 'We can do it!'?  We all thought you would admit: yes we made mistakes and we need to fix that quickly" said the woman.Merkel responded:  "I did say 'We can do it' because I saw that what was coming was a tremendous task.  What kind of chancellor would I be if I had said:  'No we cannot do it'?"  What she regretted Merkel said was not proactively creating a better refugee policy before tens of thousands began streaming into Europe. "I knew we had to do something" she said. "My mistake was prior to the arrival of the refugees. That we did not help earlier to decide who can come to us and who cannot.  I have seen from that we were not prepared for such a task."For the last 13 years Merkel has navigated the country through political crises and dilemmas. Now she's focused on securing her legacy.But beyond the big speeches Merkel also seems to be devoting her time to events like this explaining her decisions to the voters who trusted her to lead the country for so long. ,World
 (CNN)US Vice President Mike Pence has said Washington is "not going to stand for" the murder of Jamal Khashoggi as Turkey suggested that the Saudi journalist's body was possibly carried out of Turkey in diplomatic bags.While in Papua New Guinea on a foreign trip Pence said the US was "committed to ensuring that all of those responsible" for Khashoggi's death are held "accountable.""The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocity. It was also an affront to a free and independent press and the United States is determined to hold all of those accountable who are responsible for that murder." The Vice President's comments Saturday came the day after after the CIA concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally ordered the killing of Khashoggi despite the Saudi government's denials that the de facto ruler was involved according to a senior US official and a source familiar with the matter.However US President Donald Trump said Saturday it was "premature" to assess whether bin Salman was responsible for Khashoggi's killing and added that there would be "a full report on Tuesday and it will be very complete.""We're going to come up with a report as to what we think the overall impact was and who caused it and who did it" Trump said while touring homes in Malibu California that were devastated in ongoing wildfires. "We're talking about a killing. We're not talking about anything else. We're talking about a killing so who did it?"Trump said in an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News that he doesn't know if bin Salman was lying when he denied having any involvement in the murder of Khashoggi a statement that conflicts with the CIA's assessment on Friday that bin Salman personally ordered the killing of the journalist."I don't -- I don't know you know who could really know?" Trump told Fox's Chris Wallace. "But I can say this: He's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.""Do you live with [bin Salman's statement] because you need him?" Wallace asked."Well will anybody really know?  All right will anybody really know? But he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved" Trump said. "You saw we put on very heavy sanctions massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good" Trump said. On Saturday Pence also reiterated that he wanted to preserve the strong relationship with Saudi Arabia amid the murder investigation. He added that after reviewing the report on Tuesday Trump would "make his decisions in the context of an enormously important strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia."Turkey: Body may have been carried through airport It comes after Turkey's Minister of National Defence said Saturday that the dismembered body parts of the slain journalist may have been carried out of Istanbul's international airport.Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada the Turkish minister Hulusi Akar said that an 18-strong "kill team" from Saudi Arabia carried out the murder of Khashoggi and could have smuggled his body parts out of the country thanks to their diplomatic status. Because they wouldn't be searched by airport security due to their diplomatic status Akar added that it was possible that "within the luggage they carried the dismembered body of Jamal Khashoggi." "Because of the diplomatic immunity they left very easily without having any problems with the luggage" Akar said. "Under the title of a diplomatic immunity passenger -- coming going -- they have the diplomatic right to carry some of the luggage without leaving their control."Khashoggi a former Saudi royal insider who became a critic of the country's government went missing in October after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers for his upcoming marriage. The Saudi government offered changing explanations for his disappearance.On Thursday the Saudi Public Prosecutor's Office said 11 people had been charged for their involvement in the killing adding that five are facing capital punishment for being directly involved in "ordering and executing the crime."The journalist was killed following "a fight and a quarrel" at the Saudi consulate the prosecutor's office claimed. Prosecutors said Khashoggi was tied up and injected with an overdose of a sedative that killed him. Then according to prosecutors his body was dismembered and removed from the consulate by five people. Khashoggi's remains have yet to be found.The Washington Post has reported that investigators were looking into the theory that the body was dissolved in acid. A source close to the Saudi Royal Palace has denied any knowledge of the body's whereabouts.CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi Jeremy Diamond Elise Labott and Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.,World
 (CNN)The death of Jamal Khashoggi continues to hang over the heads of both US President Donald Trump and his allied Saudi officials.On Thursday Saudi prosecutors formally charged 11 people over the journalist's killing five of whom will face the death penalty. Just hours later the Trump administration announced sanctions against 17 Saudi government officials. The powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was not of course among those blamed.The timing of the two courses of action was surely no coincidence. It seems both parties were hoping their responses together would shield the Crown Prince from growing accusations of involvement. But what a difference a day makes. On Friday the CIA concluded the Crown Prince personally ordered the journalist's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month a senior US official and a source familiar with the matter told CNN.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert however said the government had not drawn any final conclusions about who was responsible adding "numerous unanswered questions" remained.Still the CIA's explosive assessment makes Riyadh's repeated denials that bin Salman was connected to Khashoggi's death much harder to swallow and if it's true the development may be a major blow to the special relationship Trump has fostered with the Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has offered so many narratives of how journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed that it's difficult to believe it will now tell the whole truth.Riyadh first claimed to know nothing about Khashoggi's disappearance but weeks later the Saudi attorney general finally admitted his murder had been premeditated. Saudi prosecutors on Thursday offered yet another version of events saying Khashoggi was killed by a lethal dose of a sedative in an abduction attempt gone wrong.Despite the reports about the CIA's findings Trump is sticking by his friends in the Middle East. Before he was briefed by the CIA on Saturday Trump repeated his belief in the Crown Prince's innocence saying he had been "told that he did not play a role" and that the country had been "a truly spectacular ally.""They give us a lot of jobs they give us a lot of business a lot of economic development" he said on Saturday.The CIA's assessment first reported by the Washington Post is based on a recording provided by the Turkish government and other evidence including US intelligence the senior US official said. Among that intelligence is a phone call from the Crown Prince's brother Khalid bin Salman and Khashoggi in which Kalid encourages the journalist to make the trip to the consulate according to the Post. Sources told the Post that Khalid made the call at his brother's command.Khalid denies the Post's reporting saying on Twitter he never spoke to Khashoggi by phone and "never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason."A Saudi embassy spokeswoman said in a statement the reported claims were false. "We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations."Trump's not aloneIt's not only Trump who would find a guilty Crown Prince a geopolitical problem. Soon after Khashoggi's death several world leaders called for an independent investigation. Those calls have turned to whispers in recent weeks and few other countries besides Canada are still talking of sanctions.Ayham Kamel head of Eurasia Group's Middle East practice said that is largely because few leaders want to see a faltering Saudi Arabia. "None of the key Western countries that have relations with Saudi Arabia-- the US and its allies -- want to destabilize the kingdom or create the situation where there is an open-power struggle" Kamel told CNN."There are too many hot spots in the Middle East and leaders don't want to add Saudi Arabia to the list. Open power struggles are difficult to predict and difficult to control."A challenge to bin Salman's authority would be particularly messy.The 33-year-old wields an extraordinary amount of power that the kingdom has never seen before among princes. He oversees almost every major agency in the country that deals with the economy security and intelligence.To put his dominance in perspective it was the Crown Prince who was tasked with shaking up the country's intelligence apparatus in response to Khashoggi's death.Bin Salman consolidated his position by intimidating his main rivals in a spectacular show of power. The Crown Prince had hundreds of senior government officials advisers and businessmen detained for months in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton transforming the hotel into a gilded prison in a masked "anti-corruption" drive. He has enemies within his own family too. Bin Salman skipped over dozens of other princes who would normally precede him as heir to the throne and any implication of the Crown Prince's involvement in the Khashoggi case could be enough of an opportunity for his rivals to reemerge."Once the dust settles on the Khashoggi killing pressure on the Crown Prince to share power with the rest of the family will remain if not increase" Stratfor the geopolitical intelligence firm wrote in a recent article.Saudis under the US' wingTrump was reluctant to issue sanctions on Saudi Arabia in the first place but was forced to under pressure from Congress and he is less likely to want to target the Crown Prince even if it means going against his own intelligence agencies. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has built a cozy relationship with bin Salman and was instrumental to designing the US' Saudi policy largely centered around the Crown Prince and his vision to modernize the kingdom's economy.In a conversation with Saudi King Salman two weeks after Khashoggi's death Trump not only seemed to buy into the monarch's version of events that he and the Crown Prince knew nothing at all of the killing he even laid out the Saudis' first narrative for them telling reporters that Khashoggi was murdered by "rogue killers" completely removed from the King and his son.It was the first sign in the case that Trump would side -- even coordinate -- with the King and Crown Prince. Then too he made clear that one journalist's life wasn't worth risking lucrative arms and trade deals (though he grossly exaggerated just how valuable those deals were to the US).It has been under this protective wing of the Trump administration that the Saudis have been able to pursue an aggressive foreign policy and act on with a sense of impunity according to Stratfor."For Riyadh the calculation that it can afford to upset relations temporarily with friends only to restore them later is a reasonable one" Stratfor wrote."Saudi Arabia's growing assertiveness is driven in part by the political cover it receives from its special relationship with the current US administration. The White House relies heavily on Saudi Arabia in its effort to contain their mutual adversary Iran. Washington also seeks Saudi cooperation to temper oil prices."Saudi Arabia is projecting that assertiveness around the region whether it be in a consulate in Turkey in the world of Lebanese politics or a brutal war in Yemen.Even Canada has felt the wrath of the Crown Prince's overreach. When officials in Ottawa demanded the release of imprisoned activists Riyadh froze new trade and investment deals suspended flights to Canada expelled Canada's ambassador to Saudi Arabia while recalling its own and even moved Saudi students studying there. Turkey's possible motivesThe greatest pressure on Saudi Arabia however has come from Turkey which says Khashoggi was strangled to death as soon as he arrived at the consulate and his body then dismembered in a premeditated murder.Turkish officials have been releasing information around Khashoggi's death drip by drip trying to draw out the world's interest and keep Riyadh in focus.Turkey has said for more than a month that it has audio evidence of how Khashoggi was killed and more recently President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country had shared that evidence with several Western allies.It is this drip feed of information that has forced Saudi officials to keep changing their story and that appears to have cornered them into admitting Khashoggi's murder was premeditated. But Turkey which is undergoing a brutal crackdown on journalists of its own is likely to have other motives in pursuing Saudi Arabia so aggressively Eurasia's Kamel said. "This is being used for geopolitical competition between Sunni powers in the region. Ankara and Riyadh are longtime competitors in the Middle East and Turkey is using this case to expand its regional power while ensuring Saudi Arabia's rise is contained"  Kamel said."The agenda Mohammed bin Salman has introduced on foreign policy is more Arab-centric not only containing Iranian influence but containing Turkish influence too. So Saudi Arabia reemerging as a leader of the Arab world doesn't necessarily align with Turkey's strategic interests. In the meantime Khashoggi's family is still hoping to discover where their relative's body -- or remains -- may be. The absence of Khashoggi's body at a funeral in an Istanbul mosque on Friday was a dark reminder that the whole truth has still not been revealed and may never be.,World
Jerusalem (CNN)Israel will pick a date for early elections on Sunday a source close to a key minister told CNN following a turbulent week for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that saw key government resignations and calls for an early vote.  The decision to call early elections came after crunch talks between Netanyahu and the rightwing Education Minister Naftali Bennett broke down on Friday. Bennett had threatened to quit the government if he wasn't given the defense portfolio after the resignation of former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman on Wednesday but Netanyahu rejected Bennett's demands.  After Friday's meeting the source who is close to Bennett told CNN: "There was a need to go to elections as soon as possible with no possibility of continuing the current government. A date for the elections is expected to be decided on Sunday following a meeting of the coalition party heads." On Thursday Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also called for early elections. Bennett's withdrawal from the coalition would leave Netanyahu without the minimum 61 seats needed to govern making elections inevitable and ending a government that lasted nearly four years. A spokesman for Netanyahu's Likud party said in a statement after the meeting with Bennett that the Prime Minister would try to stabilize his government on Sunday at the weekly cabinet meeting. "At the beginning of the week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold conversations with the heads of the coalitions and he relies on the ministers' responsibility not to make a historic mistake in toppling a right-wing government" the statement said. "Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that it's important to make every effort in order to preserve the right-wing government and not to repeat the historical mistake of 1992 when a right-wing government was toppled raised the left to power and brought the Oslo disaster upon Israel." A statement released a short time later said Netanyahu had begun those conversations Friday afternoon. Netanyahu's troubles began Wednesday when Liberman his hardline Defense Minister announced his resignation. Liberman had openly opposed a ceasefire reached with Gaza one day earlier that ended the worst 24 hours of fighting since the 2014 war advocating instead for a harsher blow against Hamas the militant group that controls the coastal enclave. Liberman called the ceasefire "a capitulation to terror." From Monday night to Tuesday afternoon Gaza militants fired some 400 rockets into Israel while the Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza. Liberman didn't have enough seats to topple the government on his own but his withdrawal left Netanyahu with a bare minimum 61-seat coalition allowing other parties to make demands of the Israeli leader. The sudden vacancy allowed Bennett leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party to demand the defense portfolio promising to quit the government if he didn't get it. On Thursday morning Kahlon the Finance Minister met with Netanyahu and said it was time to call early elections. In a statement released after the meeting Kahlon said "The stability required at this time is not achievable in the present situation and therefore the responsible act is the establishment of a new strong and stable government." Deri the Interior Minister echoed his call increasing pressure on Netanyahu to dissolve the government.The political turbulence comes as Netanyahu faces criminal investigations that have hit him and his inner circle. Israeli police say they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery fraud and breach of trust in two separate investigations. He was questioned as a suspect in a third investigation. Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence often employing the phrase "There will be nothing because there is nothing." The criminal investigations have barely damaged the Prime Minister's standing in the polls or his popularity. Polls have repeatedly projected that Netanyahu's Likud party would increase its number of seats if early elections are held. But the crisis may pose a new challenge for the Israeli leader since it appears he is being led to call early elections instead of calling them on his own. By law the government must choose an election date within three to five months making March or May the most likely time for elections. April is unlikely because of Jewish holidays during the month.,World
 (CNN)From Nollywood actresses to afrobeat superstars August Udoh has captured them all. He's lauded as Nigeria's most talented celebrity photographer but it is the stories of those on the very margins of society that are important to him. The fighters captured in series "Dambe" are ordinary working men. "They have normal jobs. Some are truck drivers others mechanics" Udoh told CNN. But with one exception - their downtime is spent competing in martial arts sport dambe. It's a traditional form of boxing where competitors fight with a single bounded hand for three rounds. As Udoh's series title suggests this martial arts club is underground its presence spread only through word-of-mouth."I had a security guard from the north who was talking about it and he showed me a video posted online" says Udoh. "I thought this is actually true - there is an underground fighting club that a lot of people in Nigeria don't know about."One armed 'kill'Dambe's history stems from the Hausa people in northern Nigeria and is thought to date back centuries. It was local butchers by trade who competed. The stronger punching hand known as the spear is traditionally tied with cotton and rope while the other hand shields against opponent's punches. Contestants can also kick -  the fight ends when an opponent falls to the ground - referred to as a "kill".  Traditionally the cloth bound hand was dipped in resin and covered in shards of glass - this has been banned. Boxing gloves were introduced in some areas to make the sport safer. But many still consider it a brutal sport due to the injuries inflicted. Viral videosLong forgotten the sport is gaining popularity thanks to dedicated YouTube channels such as Dambe Warriors which launched last year and has garnered more than 57000 subscribers and 15 million views.While Udoh's images present the raw unfettered energy of the art's young competitors dambe is a poor man's sport. Fighters are almost certainly low income earners. For them it's a chance to make money explains Udoh. Tickets for fights are often sold at around 500 Naira ($1.38) per person. "Usually the fight organizers make 50000 Naira ($137) a day."Victorious competitors can earn anywhere from $20 up to $500 which they can use to feed and take care of their families."As a fighter - champions earn a lot" Udoh said. "If you've won a lot of fights then you get paid more. There is a hierarchy thing where you attract high fees because you bring in the crowd."  Gifts are also given by fans. "People send money back to their parents one fighter was given a house."Nigeria's wealth gapUdoh spent a week traveling around Niger and Ogun states talking to the boxers who compete. The photographs raise questions on the widening regional inequalities within the country - which has been widely criticized by humanitarian groups. Those living in often wealthier states in the south have no concept of how their northern neighbors live explains Udoh. "I have friends who have not been out of Lagos since they were born - so they don't know."  "People don't realize every other state is not like Lagos" he adds. Read more: Nigeria overtakes India in extreme poverty rankingThe photographs are about shedding light upon such regional disparities Udoh explains. In 2012 he spent a month traveling around Kogi to capture the country's flood victims. Kogi a northern state was the worst affected by the 2012 floods. Some 623900 people were said to have been displaced as a result and 152575 hectares of farmland destroyed. Many of the victims homes and infrastructure have not yet been rebuilt says Udoh. The towns today remain virtually unchanged since the floods.

"I really felt their pain but there was nothing I could do."Nigeria's recent September floods has killed nearly 200 people in the country and displaced around 176000 according to Nigeria's Emergency Management Agency.Udoh notes the power of his images stem from the stories behind them. He adds: "I want to convince people to look outside of Lagos by telling these stories with my pictures.",World
Lagos Nigeria (CNN)A nurse in Malawi has been suspended after her selfie in a labor ward showing a naked pregnant woman in the background surfaced online.Patricia Malichi's selfie which has an unidentified pregnant woman lying on a hospital bed at Ndirande Health Centre in Blantyre city provoked public anger on social media with many Malawians calling for her dismissal.Malawi's Ministry of Health spokesman Joshua Malango told CNN the midwifery council and the district health authorities were handling the case.The health ministry is also investigating whether the photo was leaked or posted by the midwife."We don't want to judge her and that's why we're working with the council for a fair trial and a clear investigation of the matter and for them to come up with a recommendation" Malango told CNN."We want to find out how that picture ended up in the public domain." He however dismissed local media reports that nurses have been banned from bringing mobile devices into clinics in the country following the incident.Medics have come under fire for sharing private information of patients in their care.In January a nurse in a Russian hospital caused outrage in the country after she posted photos of sick patients on social media.Two nurses in a Florida-based hospital were fired last year after they posted a SnapChat video of themselves making inappropriate gestures at a newborn baby in a hospital.The SnapChat post also showed the woman and her colleague allegedly made the baby "dance" to rap music.,World
Lagos Nigeria (CNN)Denmark's development minister Ulla Tornaes announced Thursday that the country has withheld $9.8 million in aid money to Tanzania over "unacceptable homophobic" comments made by one of the country's government officials.Tornaes said she was "very concerned" about the negative developments in Tanzania and would no longer be giving the country the aid money."I am very concerned about the negative developments in Tanzania. Most recently unacceptable homophobic statements by a Commissioner. I have therefore decided to withhold 65 million for the country. Respect for human rights absolutely essential for DK" the Danish minister tweeted.CNN's efforts to reach Tanzania's government spokesman for comment so far have been unsuccessful.The minister did not mention the name of the government official but Tanzania is facing immense international criticism following last month's announcement of a crackdown on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender citizens.Dar es Salem regional commissioner Paul Makonda told people in the country to report people suspected of being gay to authorities.Makonda known for anti-gay rhetoric said a task force had been set up to arrest LGBT people in the city.Tanzania's government tried to distance itself from the governor's statements but not before his plans ignited a diplomatic reaction.On Tuesday a World Bank official said it had suspended visiting missions to the East African nation citing continuous harassment and discrimination of the LGBT community for the decision.It also pulled a planned $300 million educational loan that would help the country's Ministry of Education over Tanzania's policy of banning pregnant girls from going to school.The move preceded a swift recall of the head of a European Union delegation to Tanzania over what it called "deterioration of the human rights and rule of law" amid growing concerns about the abuse of the rights of LGBT people in the nation.The EU- a major donor to the country which had pledged more than $700 million in support between 2014 and 2020 said it would review its relations with Tanzania.Tanzania's government has often drawn international criticism international criticism over its treatment and policies of LGBT groups in the country.In 2017 the country's health ministry suspended HIV/AIDS services last year in 40 clinics it accused of promoting homosexuality.Ten men were arrested in November on suspicion of being gay on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar according to Amnesty International.Rights group said they were arrested while playing at the beach though local police alleged they were conducting a gay wedding.LGBT people face a 30-year jail sentence under Tanzania law mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries.CNN's Bianca Britton contributed to this report.,World
Buenos Aires (CNN)A missing Argentine naval submarine has been found a year and a day after it vanished in the South Atlantic with 44 crew members on board authorities said Saturday.The wreckage of the ARA San Juan which "suffered an implosion" was found about 870 meters (2850 feet) down on the ocean floor Argentine naval Capt. Gabriel Attis later told reporters in Buenos Aires.Family members at the navy headquarters were shown three images of the remains of the San Juan's "sail" or tower and bow sections.Hours before the wreckage was positively identified the Argentine navy tweeted an image of a point of interest on the seabed suggesting that a 60-meter-long object might be the missing vessel. An American company contracted by Argentina located the submarine.Footage showed relatives of the lost crew members grieving in the northern port of Mar del Plata the submarine's home base as they received the news the submarine had been found. The vessel's condition remains unclear.Defense Minister Oscar Aguad told reporters at a press conference Saturday that Argentina does not have the capability of recovering the sunken submarine."No we don't have the means to go down to that depth of the sea" he said adding that authorities "do not have the equipment to bring the submarine out from such a depth."The ARA San Juan disappeared November 15 last year off Argentina's coast about midway on its journey from Ushuaia in the country's south to Mar del Plata.The Argentine navy said in the following days that the vessel's captain had reported a short circuit in the vessel's battery system shortly before the last known contact. The short circuit was caused by seawater entering the vessel's "snorkel" a tube that reaches the surface to refresh the vessel's air and recharge the batteries the captain said in a call to his commander on land.Days later it emerged that a sound consistent with an explosion had been detected in the ocean near the sub's last known location by the United States and an international nuclear weapons monitor.The hunt for the vessel -- which at its height involved 28 ships and nine airplanes from 11 nations including the United States and United Kingdom -- centered on an area roughly 900 kilometers (559 miles) off the Argentine coast.Relatives of crew members prayed for their return in Mar del Plata even as hopes dwindled that the diesel-powered submarine would be found before the air supply ran out.The Argentine navy called off its rescue operation about two weeks after the sub's disappearance saying there was "no chance of survival" for its crew but search efforts continued.Among those lost was Eliana Maria Krawczyk Argentina's first female submarine officer.Ocean Infinity a US company specializing in deep water search and recovery began looking for the ARA San Juan in September using autonomous underwater vehicles operated by a team on board its ship Seabed Constructor the firm saidThree Argentine navy officers and four family members of the crew of the ARA San Juan were invited on board as observers for the search mission Ocean Infinity said.Oliver Plunkett Ocean Infinity's CEO said in a statement he hoped the discovery of the submarine would lead to "questions being answered and lessons learned" that would prevent a similar incident in the future. Ocean Infinity told CNN on Saturday its search vessel is still conducting an analysis of the debris field found around the wreck. The company confirmed it has the ability to salvage remains of the submarine should the Argentines ask. "Next steps are a matter for the authorities to determine" Plunkett said. "We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation but at the moment we are focused on completing imaging of the debris field."The vessel's loss raised questions over the navy's maintenance of its submarine fleet.The ARA San Juan was an old diesel submarine built in Germany in the mid-1980s but was refitted with new engines and batteries around five years before its disappearance Peter Layton a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University in Australia told CNN last year.The sub was designed to have a shelf life of around 30 years which had expired he said. If intact after the explosion the hull could have been expected to withstand ocean depths up to around 500 to 600 meters he said. Below that it would buckle under pressure.CNN's Daniel Silva Fernandez reported from Miami and Ignacio Grimaldi from Buenos Aires while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

 (CNN)The number of US citizens seeking refuge in Canada skyrocketed last year.Exactly 2550 Americans applied for asylum in Canada in 2017 according to data from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada. That's more than a sixfold increase from the 395 Americans who applied in 2016.It's believed that the hard-line immigration policies of President Donald Trump have fueled the increase in the number of Americans fleeing to Canada.The United States supplied the third-highest number of asylum-seekers to Canada in 2017 topped by Haiti (7785 applicants) at No. 1 and Nigeria (6005 applicants) at No. 2.There's a large number of asylum-seekers this year as well with 1215 Americans requesting refuge in Canada through the end of August.Canadian officials said that while Canada remains an open welcoming country crossing into it is not "a ticket for permanent residence.""Coming to Canada asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada" Louis Dumas a spokesman for the immigration ministry said last year.About 80% to 85% of the US asylum-seekers are of Haitian descent according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And most of this group are American-born minors crossing the border with their immigrant parents."The vast majority of US citizens claiming asylum are minor asylum claimants who were born in the United States whose parents are citizens of another country" said Peter Liang a spokesman for Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada. "In these instances the claims of persecution are made against the parents' country of origin not the United States. However given their citizenship the minor children appear as US citizens in these tables. These children predominately accompanied Haitian or Nigerian national adults."Why Haitians are leaving the USMany Haitians have headed to Canada over concerns they'll lose their temporary protected status or TPS in the United States.The Trump administration moved to end the TPS program but those plans have been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. US District Judge Edward Chen granted a preliminary injunction last month stopping the government from terminating TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti and Nicaragua.The Haitian part of TPS started shortly after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti when the Obama administration granted Haitian immigrants -- who had already been living in the United States -- temporary protected status.The program allowed them to work and shielded them from deportation. It also provided temporary refuge considering that Haiti had suffered one of the deadliest earthquakes in history and the country was seen as too unstable for people to return.The program has since been repeatedly renewed. But in 2017 Department of Homeland Security officials said conditions in Haiti were improving since the earthquake and that the program should be terminated.A wave of Haitians moved across the northern border. Many have expressed concern they'll be deported if they stay in the United States.Canada ended its version of a program that was similar to the TPS for Haitians in 2016 the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. This means Haitians without status can be deported from Canada.Many asylum-seekers have headed for Quebec where Montreal has a large Haitian community.At one point last year the asylum-seekers were being sheltered at Olympic Stadium where Montreal hosted the Summer Olympics in 1976.CNN's Madison Park and Catherine E.

 (CNN)Large groups of migrants who trekked across Mexico and hope to seek asylum in the United States are starting to arrive in the border city of Tijuana.Their journey has lasted more than a month. It sparked ire from US President Donald Trump and spurred a decision to deploy thousands of active-duty troops to the border. And it's far from over.Hundreds of Central American migrants from a so-called caravan of thousands are now within walking distance of the United States. But crossing the border legally could still take them weeks if not longer due to bottlenecks at ports of entry that US authorities say are already at capacity and unable to process them faster.Advocates warn that the lengthy wait poses serious risks for migrants who are seeking safety and pose no threat. Officials in Mexican border cities have worried about how they'll handle the influx. And some local residents are already bristling at the new arrivals with tensions flaring in the streets.Here's what we've seen unfolding so far:'This time we are going to be first'A group of about 80 lesbian gay bisexual and transgender members of the caravan were the first to make it to Tijuana.They told reporters they broke away from the larger caravan after facing discrimination for weeks. "The LGBT community was the last to be taken into account in every way. So what we wanted to do was to change that and say 'This time we are going to be first'" said Cesar Mejia a 23-year-old from Honduras who trekked north with a rainbow flag in tow. As the group marched through Mexico whistles jeers and cat calls were common. At stopping points Mejia said at times they struggled to get food."Sometimes we went hungry to protect ourselves" he said.Concerned for the group's safety RAICES the Texas-based immigrant advocacy organization that received millions of dollars in donations during the summer's family separation crisis helped transport them from Mexico City to the border."I never imagined that there would be discrimination in the caravan. Supposedly we were all united" said Lisett Won a transgender woman from Honduras who said she fled her home country after being assaulted multiple times. But meeting other LGBT migrants and banding together was empowering Won said. And now she said they're focused on their goal of seeking asylum in the United States."We want the opportunity to have a better life" Mejia said "a life with out discrimination." Protests and skirmishesThe LGBT group's arrival in Tijuana was greeted by sharp questioning from locals who interrupted a press conference the migrants were holding over the weekend to express their concerns. Neighborhood residents told reporters they were worried for their children's safety. A woman spotted a migrant wrapped in a rainbow flag and shouted "You don't need to go walking around like that."Mejia told CNN that in recent days some neighbors stopped by the house where the LGBT group is staying to apologize and offer donations of blankets and other items. But hundreds more migrants have arrived in Tijuana this week and by late Wednesday night tensions flared once again.Won told CNN some locals pushed her to the ground after she attempted to pass out socks sweaters and other items that had been donated."People here are trying to throw us out and threatening us and saying thousands of things. ... This cannot continue" she said. "We are all human beings and we all united in the struggle to reach the United States and seek asylum. They cannot trample us like this."Live online footage showed small protests and skirmishes in the Playas de Tijuana neighborhood Wednesday night.Protesters chanted "we want security" demanding the migrants get on buses and go to a local shelter. "We are not racist" one resident is heard saying in one video asking that the local government take action as fear grows that the migrants will destabilize the economy and insecurity could increase.Mexican police formed a barrier between the migrants and residents to calm the situation. Thousands more migrants are expected to arrive soonMore than 400 migrants have arrived in Tijuana in recent days according to José María Garcia director of the Juventud 2000 migrant shelter.An additional 2000 migrants are expected to reach the border city in the next two days state official Rodolfo Olimpo Hernandez Bojorquez told CNN.And there could be more coming after that. Officials have said several additional large groups of migrants are moving through Mexico -- largely trekking on foot.Hernandez said local officials in Mexico's Baja California state have been preparing for the arrival of large numbers of migrants -- possibly up to 9000 -- and are ready to shelter them in a stadium once other shelters are full. But he stressed that resources are strained and that Mexican federal authorities aren't doing enough to help. US authorities say they're ready to respond once migrants reach the border.CBP spokeswoman April Grant said Wednesday night that the agency was prepared to ensure border security as the migrants approach."We are moving hundreds of additional CBP personnel into place to ensure our ability to safely address multiple potential contingencies at and between the Southern California ports of entry" she said.On Tuesday CBP said several migrants scaled the border fence in Tijuana "to provoke the agents to arrest them but ran back across the border." "Agents remain alert. CBP has deployed additional resources to ensure the continued security of the border and safety for everyone in the area. US Customs and Border Protection officials continue to monitor the movement in Mexico of individuals who are part of the caravan" spokesman Ralph DeSio said. "At this time we believe that at least some of those individuals currently gathered in this area are from the caravan."Immigrant advocates say stepped-up security isn't what's needed. They accuse the US government of creating a crisis at the border by issuing a new rule that bans people from seeking asylum if they cross the border illegally. The rule itself is illegal advocates argue -- and they're suing to block it.There are already some 1600 migrants waiting to seek asylum at the San Ysidro port of entry Hernandez said.That's because long before recent large groups of migrants started heading toward the US border the wait to seek asylum at ports of entry has been weeks long. And now it's likely to be even longer.And Cristian Sanchez an attorney with RAICES who's been meeting with LGBT migrants in Tijuana noted that the process of seeking asylum itself is lengthy and complicated."The journey has really just begun" he said.Migrants from the caravan told CNN they still plan to cross the border legally -- no matter how long it takes.The group of LGBT migrants headed to the border Thursday to add their names to a waiting list."We want to do it legally not to climb over the wall" Won said. "We are trusting in God and hoping that they don't change the rules and that God speaks from the heart to Donald Trump."CNN's Emanuella Grinberg and Natalie Gallón contributed to this report.,World
 (CNN)The parents of Dr. Rio Nanda Putrama who died in the Indonesia airplane disaster last month that killed all 189 passengers on board have sued Boeing for its alleged "unsafe design" of the 737 Max 8 aircraft. The lawsuit filed Thursday in the Circuit Court of Cook County Illinois where Boeing is headquartered centers on a new safety feature that can cause the 737 Max 8 aircraft to "auto-dive" in certain situations.The suit alleges this is a change from prior Boeing 737 designs and that the company failed to communicate the change."At no relevant time prior to the crash...did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of unsafe condition caused by the new 'auto-diving' design" the suit alleges.Putrama was flying to Pangkal Pinang in Indonesia to get married according to his parent's lawyers.It is the latest headache for Boeing which has faced mounting pressure in the wake of the crash.On Wednesday a top Lion Air official joined a US pilots' group in alleging the company failed to warn pilots about the potential hazards of the new safety feature implicated in the crash.Zwingli Silalahi Lion Air's operational director said the manual did not tell pilots that in certain situations the plane's stall-prevention system could automatically trigger a response such as lowering the airplane's nose to prevent or exit a stall."We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 Max 8. That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation" Zwingli said.Representatives from American United and Southwest airlines each said Friday that Boeing did not include information in its flight crew manual that explained the functions of new features found on the aircraft.  Because that information was not spelled out with specificity the airlines said their pilots were not clear on all of the functionality of a key system in the aircraft. The airlines say Boeing has now communicated what the new features are and how they work and pilots are  aware of them as well.  American and United airlines said the revelation of new information will not require additional pilot training.Investigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.The airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) a labor union that represents American Airlines pilots of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features. On Thursday American Airlines backed up their pilots' claims.Lion Air Flight 610 crashed shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on October 29. Investigators believe the Max 8 plane may have experienced problems with several sensors.Boeing said last week that a safety bulletin issued to aircraft operators in the wake of the crash was merely meant to reinforce existing procedures. Both Lion Air and the APA reject the company's assertion."They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft" Capt. Dennis Tajer a spokesman for the APA group told CNN on Tuesday. "The bulletin is not reaffirming it's enlightening and adding new info."Zwingli added that Boeing's safety bulletin did not suggest additional training for pilots operating that aircraft. "We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots" he said.Zwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission the US National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary Lion Air pilots would undertake it.On Wednesday a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the company could not "discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation" and that the company had "provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.""We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing" the spokesperson said.The head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN on Wednesday that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the Max 8 planes but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.On Tuesday the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the Max 8 planes "the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft."Journalist Masrur Jamaluddin contributed to this report. ,World
Hong Kong (CNN)Every day before work Kevin Lau stopped for breakfast at a restaurant in Sai Wan Ho a residential area in eastern Hong Kong. It was a routine as ingrained in him as brushing his teeth and it nearly cost him his life. On a morning in February 2014 Lau -- a senior editor at the popular upmarket daily Ming Pao -- had parked his car on a street near the restaurant when two men wearing motorcycle helmets and gloves rushed up to him. One slashed at Lau with a meat cleaver knocking him to the floor where he lay bleeding with deep wounds in his back and legs as his assailants ran off. With what a court later described as "superhuman calm" Lau phoned for an ambulance and was rushed to hospital. He survived and two men with triad links -- Yip Kim-wah and Wong Chi-wah -- were arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. While Yip and Wong were later jailed they did not reveal who had commissioned and paid for the attack one of several against journalists in Hong Kong at that time including the firebombing of the home and office of Jimmy Lai publisher of the Apple Daily a tabloid highly critical of the Chinese government.In the wake of the attack against Lau several thousand journalists and supporters took to the streets dressed in black and carrying banners which read "They Can't Kill Us All" in a defiant show of support for press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. It was a tense period for journalists in Hong Kong. The sense of despair was lifted temporarily by the so-called Umbrella Revolution mass pro-democracy protests that broke out in late 2014. Those demonstrations saw the international media spotlight swing onto Hong Kong and the local press rose to the challenge covering every aspect of the protests and their fallout and winning multiple awards in the process. Indeed in the wake of the protests reporters' assessment of press freedom in the city rose for the first time in years according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA). But just as the Umbrella protests eventually gave way to widespread disillusionment as hoped for reforms never panned out and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures were jailed recent weeks have seen a collapse in confidence among the city's small journalist community and renewed fears of self-censorship prosecution and violence. On November 9 this year the HKJA warned of the "death knell of freedom of speech" in the city.Keeping quiet  Under Hong Kong's de facto constitution the Basic Law residents are guaranteed "freedom of speech of the press and of publication" rights that are not granted or protected in mainland China. While this means there is little top-down control of media in Hong Kong self-censorship within the local press has been widely reported both by front-line reporters and editors who have left publications they felt were unwilling to stand up to the government or corporate pressure. One of the best descriptions of self-censorship and its pernicious power which sometimes outstrips that of more aggressive control comes from China scholar Perry Link. "(The) government's censorial authority in recent times has resembled not so much a man-eating tiger or fire-snorting dragon as a giant anaconda coiled in an overhead chandelier" Link wrote about academic self-censorship in China. "Normally the great snake doesn't move. It doesn't have to. It feels no need to be clear about its prohibitions. Its constant silent message is 'You yourself decide' after which more often than not everyone in its shadow makes his or her large and small adjustments -- all quite 'naturally'." While mainland China has a massive formal censorship apparatus controlling all aspects of society from movies and music to the Internet and book publishing much of what affects people on a day to day level is closer to self-censorship.Social media firms for example employ hundreds of censors to police what their users say but for the most part they do so without guidance or direction from the central government second guessing what their bosses and by extension the Communist Party's official censors will disapprove of. In this context self-censorship becomes more effective the more unclear the boundaries and the greater the repercussions for potentially stepping across them. This could be seen in Hong Kong in the wake of the attack on Lau as the chance of a violent response to a story suddenly seemed a real possibility to many reporters compounding existing fears about the "wrong" story costing the journalist their job or resulting in costly legal proceedings. For over a decade however even as warnings grew about self-censorship by Hong Kong reporters and media ownership was consolidated by a few China-friendly businesspeople the foreign press has largely operated unfettered a stark contrast to China where international reporters regularly harassed ejected from the country and their local colleagues arrested and jailed. That all changed this year. Action reactionThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong is positioned half way up a hill on a busy windy road with narrow pavements and multiple lanes in the city's Central district.It's not a good venue to protest outside of and yet in August several dozen people squeezed themselves into police cordoned-off areas opposite and next to the club bearing banners accusing the elite institution of being involved in a "conspiracy to split Hong Kong from China." Inside the focus of the protests Andy Chan sat looking calm and composed as he prepared to give a speech arguing for the city's independence. He chatted casually with FCC staff and laughed when fire department officials rushed into the building carrying axes in response to an apparent hoax call. Within days of the event taking place Chan's Hong Kong National Party was officially banned under public security laws the first time they had ever been used to go after a political organization. The FCC itself meanwhile was facing a storm of publicity amid calls for it to lose the lease to its property and potentially even its license to operate. By October those fears appeared misguided until Victor Mallet an editor at the Financial Times who had hosted Chan in his capacity as acting-FCC President put in for a routine visa renewal. Compared to China and many other countries in the region (including ones which boast about being democracies) Hong Kong is an incredibly easy place to get a journalist visa but Mallet had his refused an almost unprecedented move the government has yet to explain but nearly everyone else has connected to the Chan talk. While the local government has consistently denied that Mallet's ejection was anything to do with press freedom the failure to provide an alternate explanation as well as the facts of the case have left most to draw their own conclusions. "We ... are deeply concerned that with this action taken with no stated or apparent legal basis Hong Kong's special place as a bastion of free expression and a free press has been eroded" 17 former presidents of the FCC wrote in an open letter to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after Mallet was denied entry to the city as a visitor on November 8. New normalWhile reporters working in mainland China are obviously subject to the pressures and concerns that can lead to self-censorship -- fear of violence fear of being ejected from the country or even jailed -- there is an additional factor in Hong Kong in that the city has long been a place where many expats including foreign reporters are more like immigrants getting permanent residency and raising their children rather than moving on after a few years. Being ejected from a country one never had any intention of living in can though most journalists would not admit it be a boon to career prospects significantly building the reporter's profile and reputation. But being forced to leave somewhere you intended to raise your family and settle down can be devastating and questions naturally arise over whether any given story or event or interview is worth that? Recent weeks have seen two incidents which appear from the outside to be clear cut cases of self-censorship. The specter of the attack on Lau as well as the 2015 disappearance of several Hong Kong booksellers was raised on November 2 when the organizers of a show by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao canceled the event a day before it was due to take place alleging "threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist." This was followed by the cancellation of a talk by another Chinese exile novelist Ma Jian at Tai Kwun an art space which has received government funding as part of a series of events connected to the Hong Kong International Literary Festival.In a statement the Director of Tai Kwun Timothy Calnin said organizers "do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.""The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong" said Jason Y. Ng president of PEN Hong Kong a pro-free speech organization."It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity" added Ng.The self-censorship charge appeared to be confirmed when Tai Kwun abruptly reversed its decision and agreed to host Ma after all. "Ma has made public statements which clarify that his appearances in Hong Kong are as a novelist and that he has no intention to use Tai Kwun as a platform to promote his personal political interests" Calnin said in a statement.  Over all of this -- Mallet's visa refusal Badiucao's cancelled show Andy Chan's banned party and all the protests and demonstrations they inspired -- hangs a long delayed anti-sedition provision contained within the Basic Law the city's de facto constitution. Article 23 of Basic Law instructs the local government to "enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason secession sedition subversion against the Central People's Government ... and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies." Attempts to implement the law in 2003 sparked massive street protests which eventually saw it shelved but it has remained a priority of the central government and current leader Carrie Lam has vowed to create "suitable conditions" for passing the law though she has not outlined any timetable.While the Hong Kong government has shown it is not lacking in powers to go after protesters or dampen expression Article 23 would massively expand the amount of forbidden topics in a city already nervous about its freedoms and possibly even end its role as a hub for international media in Asia. Speaking to reporters at the Tai Kwun event Ma Jian said people nevertheless need to "have the courage to break" through self-censorship. "The freedom to speak is the basis of our civilization" he added. "We have to safeguard our freedom of expression. We have to safeguard our civilization."Disclosure: James Griffiths is a member of the Hong Kong Journalists Association and sits on the organization's press freedom committee. ,World
Seoul (CNN)North Korea has tested a "newly developed ultramodern" weapon in an event supervised by leader Kim Jong Un state media said Friday amid faltering nuclear disarmament negotiations with the United States.Very little is known about the weapon or whether it is even new but the test is the latest sign that Pyongyang is prepared to return to a more militaristic relationship with Washington if talks continue to go poorly. "He's tiptoeing towards a more aggressive posture in negotiations with the US and he's signaling that he's not going to give way and can simply return to his old practices if (the US) don't change their approach" Josh Pollack senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterrey told CNN.North Korea's state news agency KCNA announced the test on Friday morning providing no details on the location of the event and little information about the weapon itself other than it was "tactical" and had been commissioned "personally" by Kim's father and predecessor Kim Jong Il.A South Korean government source with military knowledge told CNN the weapon was likely a piece of long-range artillery "likely to be a multiple rocket launcher.""As it is a tactical weapon test we do not view it as a North Korean military provocation" the source said.Deteriorating relationsIt marks the first time Kim has publicly attended such a blatantly military-focused event since his high-profile summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump in early 2018."Chairman Kim Jong Il had chosen personally and directed step by step with his special attention paid to it was born at last" the KCNA article said."(Kim Jong Un) added that the weapon is just like a posthumous weapon and he missed Kim Jong Il very much while seeing the great success of its test."Despite huge hopes for a breakthrough following the international summits with Moon and Trump little progress has been made in recent months. On Thursday US Vice President Mike Pence said the US was backing down on a requirement for North Korea to provide a full list of nuclear and missile sites before a second meeting between Trump and Kim.Meanwhile an official with the North Korean Foreign Ministry said on November 5 that if the US doesn't start removing sanctions on Pyongyang Kim could restart "building up nuclear forces."In a separate development on Friday North Korea announced it would deport a US citizen who it claimed had crossed the border "illegally" from China.The man identified as Bruce Byron Lowrance reportedly entered North Korea on October 16 saying he was under "the control of the US Central Intelligence Agency" at the time according to KCNA.A spokesman for the US Embassy in Seoul told CNN he was unable to comment on individual cases "for privacy concerns." CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the South Korean government for further comment.In 2017 a man with the same name was deported from South Korea after he was caught wandering near the North Korean border according to the LA Times. They said he wanted to "help resolve the conflict" between Washington and Pyongyang.'Veiled threat'Pollack said the weapon test was the latest "veiled threat" from Pyongyang to US that if progress wasn't made soon a more hostile relationship could be back on the table."What kind of weapon this may be is perfectly ambiguous ... but they did attribute it to the Academy of National Defense Sciences and they are associated with the missile program" he said.Shin Beom-chol a researcher at the Seoul-based Asan Institute said although the exact type of weapon was unknown it was unlikely to be a missile as South Korea would have detected it."North Korea did not go on into any further detail about this test because they probably didn't want the situation escalating out of proportion" he told CNN.Speaking after the announcement of the weapon's test South Korean Unification Ministry deputy spokeswoman Lee Eu-gene downplayed the significance of the event saying Kim had been continuing his inspections in the military sector "intermittently."CNN's Sophie Jeong contributed to this article.,World
London (CNN Business)Volkswagen has committed to spending tens of billions of dollars as part of a dramatic shift to electric and autonomous vehicles. The Germany carmaker said Friday that it would invest €44 billion ($50 billion) by 2023 to develop electric cars self-driving vehicles and other new technology. Speaking at a press conference following a meeting of the company's supervisory board CEO Herbert Diess described the company's strategy as an "electric offensive."Diess acknowledged that increased spending on new technology could initially harm earnings growth. The investment is roughly €10 billion ($11.4 billion) above what the company set aside for new tech in last year's budget plan."Volkswagen must become more efficient more productive and more profitable in order to finance the high expenditure in the future and in order to stay competitive" Diess said during the press conference.Volkswagen's stock which declined roughly 12% so far this year dropped another 1.3% on Friday. Volkswagen and FordDiess said that talks with US automaker Ford (F) about working together were "progressing positively."So far the only alliance firmly in place between Ford and Volkswagen involves an agreement to work together on commercial vehicles. But Diess sees potential in more cooperation."We can solve the transformation of our business more easily with partnerships" he said Friday.Automakers are spending billions of dollars as they try to develop the electric and self-driving vehicles they believe are the future. They're also facing more competition from tech companies including Uber and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG). Upstarts like Tesla (TSLA) have proved formidable too.Production changesVolkswagen said that the first model built under its new strategy the ID will begin rolling off the assembly lines in 2022. Diess said the car will have a range of up to 550 km (340 miles) and cost the equivalent of its current diesel Golf. The car group which owns the Porsche and Audi brands said it would attempt to increase the productivity of its plants 30% by 2025. It plans to build vehicles from different brands on the same production lines as part of the effort.It will also relocate production of the Passat from Germany to the Czech Republic. Diess said that Volkswagen (VLKAF) was considering whether to build its own battery cells a key component in electric vehicles. China shiftThe carmaker also announced leadership changes in China the world's largest car market. Diess now has direct responsibility for the China business a move that Volkswagen said reflects "the growing importance of the Chinese market and the high pace of technological development in China."Stephan Wöllenstein who currently oversees the passenger car division in China will handle business operations in the country going forward.,World
London (CNN Business)Britain awoke Friday to newspaper front pages that portrayed its prime minister as a lonely soldier intent on keeping her Brexit plan alive.The headlines were largely unsympathetic to Theresa May following a tumultuous day that started with a wave of resignations by key ministers and ended with the prime minister defending her plan in a televised press conference.Rumors swirled throughout Thursday as political analysts and newspaper columnists questioned whether May could continue as prime minister. But by Friday the media was focused on her defiance.Top UK newspapers led with images of May during her press conference. The Financial Times Daily Mirror and Daily Express each described May as "defiant." The Times headline read: "Lonely May staggers on."The Guardian summed up the previous day's action as "Resignations a coup and a day of hostility. But May fights on." It used an image of the prime minister seemingly glaring over a glass of water.Tabloids the I and Metro chose to focus on conflicts within May's Conservative Party with Metro declaring the fight "blue on blue" as the party "tears itself apart." The Telegraph quoted May for its headline: "Am I going to see this through? Yes I am."The Daily Mail which had been a staunch supporter of Brexit until a slight softening in its line following a recent change in editors was among the most sympathetic to the prime minister. It called out "saboteurs" within her party asking "Have they lost the plot?"The Sun headline played off a comment about cricket made during the press conference on Thursday. The staunchly pro-Brexit paper declared May was on a "sticky wicket" and it used a photo of her grimacing and putting her hand to her head. ,World
London (CNN Business)A sharp decline in the value of the pound and plummeting bank stocks are sending a clear message: a chaotic Brexit will plunge the UK economy into recession. Dramatic market reaction to the resignation of key UK government ministers underscores the steep price that Brits are likely to pay if the country crashes out of the European Union without a divorce deal.The resignations mean that Prime Minister Theresa May faces an uphill battle to win parliamentary support for the Brexit deal she has negotiated with the European Union. The risk of a chaotic exit from the bloc has risen sharply as a result.The pound was flat Friday after falling as much as 2% against the dollar during the previous trading session. Shares in UK banks such as Lloyds (LYG) Barclays (BCS) and Royal Bank of Scotland were hit for a second consecutive day."That's quite a serious escalation and the markets are reacting very violently [because] the risks of a more disorderly situation are increasing and are very material" John Wraith head of UK rates strategy at UBS said on Thursday.Wraith said the United Kingdom will plunge into recession next year if the government fails to secure an orderly break with its largest trading partner. He predicted the UK economy would be up to 10% smaller in 2023 than if the country had remained in the European Union. "It's a big number but it is a big problem" he said.  The fear is that Britain could tumble out of the European Union without a transition deal to keep it temporarily inside the bloc's market for goods and services and customs union. That would mean new trade barriers and disruption to supply chains for food medicines and manufactured goods. Analysts expect a sharp decline in business confidence real estate prices and an even weaker pound. Airlines may not be able to fly. The International Monetary Fund warned Wednesday that a disorderly exit would "lead to widespread disruptions in production and services." Rating agency S&P has told Brits to expect "a short sharp recession." "Nobody can be sure of the extent of any hit to activity but we think it could be as high as 3% of GDP with an outright recession probable" wrote analysts at research firm Capital Economics.Companies have raced to prepare for the worst as negotiations dragged on in recent months. The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29 2019 but the prolonged talks left businesses in the dark on terms of future trade. Pharmaceutical companies are stockpiling medicines. BMW (BMWYY) plans to shut its Mini factory in England for one month of maintenance immediately after Brexit because it can't be sure of getting the parts it needs. The German carmaker said in a statement Friday that it would "continue to prepare for the worst-case scenario" because of the "uncertain" political situation. "We continue to call on all sides to work towards a final agreement which maintains the truly frictionless trade on which our international production network is based" BMW said.Financial services firms are likely see their access to EU markets reduced under any Brexit scenario but a messy exit would be most dangerous. Households would also be harmed by a chaotic Brexit. The value of the pound would slump further hiking the cost of imported products. Inflation would rise. S&P estimated that annual household incomes would drop by £2700 ($3440) on average in each of the three years following a messy breakup.The IMF warned that a decline slump in the value of the pound would hit consumer and business confidence."[That] in turn would have adverse impact on the balance sheets of households firms and financial intermediaries" it said. Bank shares were particular hard hit on Thursday because of worries that borrowers would struggle to pay back loans if the economy slumps following a messy Brexit. Interest rates may also have to remain lower for longer. RBS has already set aside £100 million ($125 million) to cover the fallout from Brexit. While a recession is likely under the worst Brexit scenario the United Kingdom would probably dodge a financial crisis. "The UK banking system is incredibly resilient and well capitalized" said Wraith. "If you look at the stress tests they all passed — they include way worse scenarios than we envision even in the worst case Brexit scenario.",World
Hong Kong (CNN Business)US tariffs are prompting companies to move some production out of China but it's not going where President Donald Trump would prefer.The trade war has made more than $250 billion of Chinese exports more expensive for Americans — from leather belts to refrigerators to motorcycles. The disruption to the world's biggest trading relationship has electronics manufacturers industrial machinery makers and fashion brands working on shifting some of their assembly lines."We are flooded by inquiries" said William Ma group managing director of Kerry Logistics a Hong Kong-based firm that helps companies around the world manage their supply chains. "It all happens after the trade war."Many firms are keeping much of their operations in China which offers a giant domestic market and advantages that businesses struggle to find elsewhere. But those that are moving aren't flocking to the United States. Instead they're looking to transfer work to other Asian countries. In a recent survey by two American chambers of commerce in China one third of the companies who responded said they were looking to switch to production outside of China as a result of the trade war. Only 6% said they were considering moving business back to the United States.Asia not AmericaIn some industries the tariffs have accelerated the shift of manufacturing from China to countries in Southeast Asia where labor is cheaper.Steve Madden (SHOO) whose handbags have been hit by a 10% tariff says it's moving a significant chunk of its production to Cambodia and other countries. The company currently makes about 85% of its handbags in China a figure that could drop to 50% or 60% next year."The shift is almost entirely due to the US-China trade conflict" Steve Madden CEO Ed Rosenfeld told CNN's Alison Kosik. "We have to prepare as though tariffs will be the new normal but we are hopeful that cooler heads will prevail." Consumer tech brands are also looking to Southeast Asia. Hugh Lo vice president of the consumer division at Taiwan's New Kinpo Group which makes electronics for clients such as Toshiba (TOSBF) and Samsung (SSNLF) says he has been inundated with inquiries from companies keen to transfer manufacturing out of China. A year ago his team got about one inquiry a week he said. Now it's "maybe 30 times more."Lo said that TV and gaming device makers have been particularly interested in relocating. He declined to name individual companies.Big industrial suppliers have been hit hard too with many of their products subject to the new tariffs.Toshiba Machine said it's moving some of its production of molding equipment in Shanghai overseas and machinery maker Komatsu (KMTUY) told CNN that it plans to shift some of its assembly lines to Japan or Mexico. Nathan Resnick whose San Diego-based startup Sourcify helps thousands of businesses place orders with manufacturers across Asia has also noticed a clear shift away from China this year.In January Chinese factories supplied as much as 90% of the orders his company helped place in industries like textiles and household appliances. Now he estimates that figure has plummeted to about 50% with the focus moving to countries like Thailand Vietnam and the Philippines."It's really just been recently" Resnick told CNN. "I didn't go to any of those countries last year."Leaving China isn't easyA lot of companies are unwilling to leave China which has a range of advantages for manufacturing industries that are spread across Asia. Many of the products US firms export from China have to fit exact requirements necessitating specialized equipment and highly trained workers according to Harley Seyedin president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China."Their supply chains cannot be adjusted in short order" Seyedin told CNN.China also boasts better roads ports and power grids than most Southeast Asian countries. "China just has such a great infrastructure" Resnick said. "You go to some of these areas in the Philippines or Vietnam and the ground surrounding the factory is not developed whatsoever."Starting from scratch in another country is a major step.Executives estimate it could take up to two years to build a new factory. Then there are the challenges of navigating the local bureaucracy and training new staff to meet the company's standards. "It takes time" said Ma at Kerry Logistics. "Things cannot be done overnight."His company is rushing to help businesses move their supply chains to other Asian countries."We definitely need to hire more people rent more warehouses buy more trucks" he said. Businesses that want to move their orders outside China face another problem: finding factories in the region that can accept them."I have factories that we work with in Vietnam that are booked up for the next year" Resnick said. "Their production lines are full. And so you really do at times have to hunt and find factories that still have capacity."But when it comes to switching to US-based suppliers there's little interest."That's not even been a consideration for any of the companies that we work with" said Resnick.Junko Ogura contributed to this report.,World
New York (CNN Business)Boeing's stock has slid more than 8% in the past week as investors grow increasingly concerned that it could be held liable for the deadly Lion Air crash last month.The first lawsuit against Boeing related to the crash was filed Thursday. The parents of one passenger sued the company claiming that the downed plane a 737 MAX 8 had an unsafe design.Lion Air flight 610 crashed on October 29 into the sea near Jakarta Indonesia soon after taking off killing all 189 on board. The suit alleges Boeing failed to communicate a new safety feature that hadn't existed in previous 737s. Lion Air's operational director accused Boeing of withholding information from pilots about a safety feature that automatically lowers the airplane's nose to prevent or exit a stall.Justin Green an attorney for Kreindler & Kreindler and a CNN aviation analyst said he believes that Boeing might "very well" be held liable. "Boeing had provided its customers prior to the service bulletin but did not adequately inform pilots of the potential problem and how to respond to it" he said.Boeing recently told CNN that it doesn't "discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation" and it has provided updates to airlines about existing safety procedures on the 737 MAX 8.  "We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing" the spokesperson said.American Airlines (AAL) said it was "unaware of some the functionality" on the 737 MAX 8 and said its work with Boeing is "ongoing." The airline has more than a dozen in operation.But this past week's Boeing (BA) losses have weighed heavily on the Dow and is one of its worst performers. Still the Chicago-based company's stock is up nearly 16% for the year. Rene Marsh contributed to this report.,World

With no choice but to start his engine to escape the rough terrain Thomson triggered a 24-hour penalty and has all but dashed plans for a champagne celebration. Although he crossed the finish line in Pointe-a-Pitre on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe first on Friday the penalty means Thomson will likely place out of the top three finishers of the race which began on November 4 off the coast of Saint Malo in northern France."The jury has decided that I have a 24-hour penalty which will mean I will not win the race" he accepted.  "How do I feel about that? Well I think that is very fair because I don't think I should win the race after hitting Guadeloupe."'They don't think you're coming back'Thomson finished second and third in consecutive Vendee Globe around-the-world solo races. He spent an astonishing 74 days at sea in the 2016-2017 edition."In some ways it's easier because it's not quite as daunting" Thomson told CNN Sport days before embarking on the Route du Rhum "but on other hand there's no downtime and you can't make a mistake -- so it's a bit unforgiving"You're still racing across the Atlantic on your own. The Vendee Globe is almost gladiatorial -- half a million people turn up at the start probably because they don't think you're coming back."This one I don't think about not coming back. I think about drinking rum in the Caribbean in a few weeks. "It's a different challenge but it's not a leisure cruise. The boats have become faster and faster in theory it's a downwind race which is pretty stressful there's no time to get into a rhythm and you'll be more tired than ever before."That talk of fatigue proved prophetic and spelled Thomson's undoing. Thomson planned to sleep in 20 to 40 minute bursts every two to four hours during this race and made note of an alarm clock wired to a loud horn to wake him up.READ: Alex Thomson: 'People think we're crazy'In case he was still asleep five minutes later the shockwave watch was designed to deliver a mild but "not very pleasant" electric shock.Sadly that system failed when Thomson slept right through the horn on Thursday and the modern-day risk of not charging one's digital device caught up to him. ,World

 (CNN)Lewis Hamilton has clarified his comments on Indian poverty after some of his social media followers were "upset." In an interview with the BBC the five-time world champion said he felt "conflicted" attending the Indian Grand Prix which ran on the Formula One calendar from 2011 to 2013.Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videos"I've been to India before to a race which was strange because India was such a poor place yet we had this massive beautiful grand prix track made in the middle of nowhere" he said. "I felt very conflicted when I went to that grand prix."READ: Can legendary Formula One name fire again? READ: Max Verstappen ordered to do 'public service'That led to some fans criticizing the British driver for his remarks with one Twitter using writing: "My country is a bit strange as we have the mix of all cultures. "My country is a bit strange as have the world's largest democracy. But Lewis Hamilton off all these we are not 'poor country' as it seems to you."Another wrote: "No Lewis Hamilton you are wrong. F1 needs to go to new countries to popularize the sport. "I think it's better you stick to racing and let the sponsors marketing and branding teams for Formula 1 handle the race circuits. FYI F1 is hugely popular in India."The Buddh International Circuit hosted just three grands prix before it was removed from the F1 schedule following a tax dispute.About 60 percent of India's nearly 1.3 billion people live on less than $3.10 a day the World Bank's median poverty line according to the bank. And 21 percent-- or more than 250 million people -- survive on less than $2 a day. In India the top 1 percent of the population owns 58 per cent of the country's wealth."Hey everyone I noticed some people are upset with my comment on India" Hamilton posted on his social media accounts. "First off India is one of the most beautiful places in the world. "The culture there is incredible. I have visited and always had an amazing time. However whilst it's the fastest growing economy it also has a lot of poverty."Hamilton said it "felt strange to drive past homeless people then arrive in a huge arena where money was not an issue."India spent an estimated $400 million to bring Formula One to the country building a brand new track and 120000-seat arena in 2011."They spent hundreds of millions on that track that is now never used" Hamilton said. "That money could have been spent on schools or homes for those in need."When we did have the race nobody came because it was too expensive most likely or no interest. However I have met some amazing Indian fans."But while there were some who criticized the 33-year-old many others agreed with his comments."I knew ... Nothing wrong in there! I'm from India as well and what you said was correct" wrote one fan."Totally true!" wrote another. "Being from India myself I totally agree with what you've said. But for interest to flourish here races should be conducted here. Personally a big fan.",World
 (CNN)Tommi Mäkinen has come a long way since becoming Finland's national ploughing champion at the age of 18. He transferred his tractor skills -- learned on his father's farm in Puuppola -- to the world of rally swiftly becoming a force to be reckoned with. His racing career yielded four consecutive world championship titles between 1996 and 1999 and a total of 24 race wins on the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) circuit including five in Finland and four in Monte Carlo. By the time Mäkinen retired in 2003 he had cemented his legendary status in the sport. But that was not enough. In 2016 he returned to the sport as principal of the TOYOTA GAZOO Racing (TGR) rally team. From the track to the sidelines According to Mäkinen the new job requires many of the same skills as driving. "A driver needs (to be) pretty strong mentally" he tells CNN Sport. "You need to have a good technical understanding (of the car)... and of course you need to understand the soul of the car." Mäkinen has transferred his driving skills into management. His experience of both sides helps him to lead the team. As Miikka Anttila a TGR co-driver says "Tommi knows and understands what's going on in the sport what is important for us and what is important for the crew to perform well." He has also brought his competitive drive. "He loves the sport and he wants to win" says Tom Fowler TGR's chief engineer. "He wants us to be constantly moving forwards to make sure we're ahead of the game."Road car vs. rally car Building a rally car is not simple. The shell may look like a normal car -- TGR's Yaris WRC looks like a souped-up version of the everyday model -- but inside there are no cushioned seats automatic windows or air conditioning. It has been stripped to the bare minimum. Every component has been fine-tuned to enhance the vehicle's aerodynamics reduce its weight and ultimately increase its speed.In Mäkinen's eyes there is no such thing as the perfect rally car -- the model is constantly being tweaked. Unlike a normal car that might be serviced every 20000 kilometers a rally car will be serviced every 50 or 100 kilometers he says. Each car has two dedicated engineers and five mechanics -- a person for each corner and one manning the engine."We're learning all the time from every rally every stage every kilometer" he says.And that he explains is part of the thrill. "My active career was very very exciting" says Mäkinen. "But I've always been that kind of person that wants to find new challenges... (Since) we started our racing operation every day has been different." The Flying FinnsTOYOTA returned to the sport in 2017 after a 17-year absence and it has already made its mark.In just its second season back in the sport TGR has registered three wins so far and sits second in the manufacturers' championship.As well as Mäkinen the team boasts two Finnish drivers Jari-Matti Latvala and Esapekka Lappi.Across all forms of motorsport there has long been a saying: "If you want to win hire a Finn."The Nordic country has a history of breeding some of the world's best rally drivers. The first "flying Finn" was Timo Mäkinen -- no relation to Tommi -- who dominated the sport during the 1960s and 1970s. Finnish drivers have won a total of 13 championships since the WRC began in 1979 -- second only to France on 15 which has jumped ahead thanks to Sébastien Loeb and Sébastien Ogier.  Finland's varied conditions its forested tracks fast-flowing gravel roads and spectacular jumps make it the perfect testing ground earning it the title of "the grand prix of rallying." Mäkinen is pleased to be working on home ground with TGR based in Finland. Visit CNN.com/Rally for more news features and videos"Our environment for the test program is absolutely brilliant here" he says. "Then it's a question of professionals...

A 2013 survey found that less than 8% of Nigerian women are employed in professional managerial or technology jobs. Ajayi-Akinfolarin hopes to change that statistic.Who she's helped: Since 2012 her group -- Pearls Africa Foundation -- has helped more than 400 disadvantaged girls ages 10 to 17 gain the technical skills and confidence they need to transform their lives. Through the foundation's free GirlsCoding program girls get training in HTML CSS JavaScript Python and Scratch and visit tech companies to help them visualize themselves joining the industry. Many come from slums or other challenging circumstances such as orphanages correctional homes and even a camp for those who've had to flee Boko Haram militants. She says: "Technology is a space that's dominated by men. Why should we leave that to guys?"Read more about Abisoye Ajayi-AkinfolarinMaria Rose Belding: Feeding the hungryHer cause: Maria Rose Belding wants to help feed the millions of Americans who don't regularly have enough to eat by connecting them with the massive amounts of food in America that goes wasted -- estimated at up to 40%. She teamed up with a fellow student to develop a free online platform called MEANS which puts businesses that have extra food in touch with charities that feed the hungry. Who she's helped: Run largely by high school and college students the nonprofit has helped redistribute more than 1.8 million pounds of food since 2015.She says: "MEANS aims to make it easier to donate food than to throw it in the dumpster. We're like a bridge that hasn't existed before."Read more about Maria Rose BeldingAmanda Boxtel: Helping the injured walk againHer cause: Amanda Boxtel survived a horrific skiing accident and doctors told her she would never walk again. She defied those expectations with the help of machines called bionic exoskeleton suits which inspired Boxtel to create Bridging Bionics.The nonprofit provides high-tech physical therapy to people with mobility impairments near Aspen Colorado. Who she's helped: Bridging Bionics's physical therapists work one-on-one with clients at local gyms creating individualized recovery plans based on their mobility issues. Clients are treated for issues ranging from spinal cord injuries to neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy and Parkinson's disease. The organization has provided free or low-cost therapeutic sessions to more than 60 people helping them overcome their injuries and do something doctors never believed possible: walk again. She says: "People need to start believing in themselves and their potential. Life isn't over. They can still recover."Read more about Amanda Boxtel Rob Gore: Breaking the cycle of violence His cause: As a hospital ER physician in Brooklyn New York Dr. Rob Gore saw the results of violence all too closely. So in 2009 Gore and a handful of volunteers started the Kings Against Violence Initiative (KAVI) which works with at-risk high school students teaching them mediation and conflict resolution.Who he's helped: KAVI has launched anti-violence programs at Kings County hospital local schools and the broader community serving more than 250 young people. The nonprofit also provides "hospital responders" to assist victims of violence and their families. He says: "Violence is everywhere they turn ... You want to make sure they can learn how to process deal with it and overcome it." Read more about Rob Gore Luke Mickelson: Making a place for kids to sleep safely   His cause: In 2012 Luke Mickelson was shocked to learn that there were needy children in his town of Twin Falls Idaho who were forced to sleep on the floor because they had no beds. Using safety guidelines and his daughter's bunk bed as a template Mickelson started using his own money to buy wood and supplies to build beds for these children. He recruited friends and family members to help. As word spread interest and involvement surged.Who he's helped: Mickelson founded Sleep in Heavenly Peace a nonprofit that has built and delivered more than 1500 beds for children across the US. The charity has grown to include training courses construction manuals and more than 65 local chapters nationwide. What he says: "These kids ... didn't get into this situation because of their choices. The need I have is seeing the joy on kids' faces knowing that I can make a difference."Read more about Luke Mickelson Susan Munsey: Rescuing victims of the sex tradeHer cause: As a teen Susan Munsey was lured into a life of prostitution in Southern California where she learned about the abuse of young women firsthand.  Eventually she was able to escape that world to become a clinical social worker and a psychotherapist. In 2009 Munsey founded GenerateHope a nonprofit that offers a safe place for survivors of sex trafficking to heal and build new lives. The group provides long-term housing therapy education and medical care. Who she's helped: To date Munsey says GenerateHope has been a refuge for more than 100 victims -- some as young as 18. Participants attend classes to get caught up on their high school education and prepare for college. They receive therapy focused on their traumatic experiences. Women can stay at GenerateHope's safe house for up to two years and benefit from a variety of volunteer-led support services such as equine and art therapy dance and yoga. She says: "I always knew that God would use that time that I was trafficked in some way. It wasn't just going to be wasted time."Read more about Susan Munsey Florence Phillips: Teaching America's newcomers Her cause: Florence Phillips served for years in Kenya Guatemala and Jamaica working on community-building projects and teaching English. When she returned to the US she eventually settled in Carson City Nevada where immigrants make up roughly 20% of the state's population.

Stackable found that many women inmates were first-time non-violent offenders. She listened to their stories and began to understand their difficult lives.Who she's helped: In 2014 she decided to use the power of creative writing to help imprisoned women by launching her nonprofit Poetic Justice. During weekly classes inside five Oklahoma prisons women inmates meditate and learn about poetry and creative writing. Volunteers help prompt ideas and provide individual attention. At the end of class the women share their work with one another. For Stackable -- whose group has reached more than 2500 women -- the classes offer a therapeutic way for the women to work through past trauma and find healing.She says: "I see these women gain self-confidence and find self-worth. I just want them to find hope. If they can find hope it can change their lives."

Tulsa Oklahoma (CNN)Ellen Stackable has been an English teacher for more than 20 years. "I just fell in love with the idea that writing could change someone's life" she said.While working on her graduate school thesis in 2013 she stumbled upon a topic that would change hers.Stackable learned that her home state of Oklahoma has the highest rate of female incarceration in the country -- and it has held this record for more than 25 years.  "We have harsh sentencing laws and we're locking up so many women" she said. "I couldn't believe what was going on in my state."In 2014 she decided to bring creative writing classes to incarcerated women. Her nonprofit Poetic Justice started in one location. Now the program is in five female prisons in Oklahoma. As Stackable began meeting the women in prison she learned many of them were first-time non-violent offenders. She began to hear their stories and learn about their difficult lives.  "These women have been failed by everyone" Stackable said. "They have childhood trauma; many have been sexually abused or experienced domestic violence. When you learn what they've been through you understand how they found their way to prison."During the weekly Poetic Justice classes the women meditate learn about poetry and creative writing brainstorm and then spend time writing. Volunteers help prompt ideas and provide individual attention. At the end of class the women can share their work with one another. "It's a sacred place where you can write and you can feel free to share your writing and trust people in a place where no one trusts anybody" Stackable said. "In a place that never feels safe you make a safe place."At the end of the eight-week course each woman receives a printed book containing a collection of their group's work."When people read what these women have written they are blown away" Stackable said. "Everyone assumes they're in prison so they must be dumb. But they are talented creative and incredible writers."For Stackable -- whose group has reached more than 2500 women -- this is about much more than writing. She views these courses as a therapeutic way for the women to work through past trauma and find healing."I see these women gain self-confidence and find self-worth" she said. "I just want them to find hope. If they can find hope it can change their lives." CNN's Meghan Dunn spoke with Stackable about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: What inspired you to bring writing to these women? Stackable: I wanted something that I felt like wasn't just me reaching down and giving somebody something but giving them a tool and a way that they could change and empower themselves. Once they find out they can write no one's ever going to be able to take that away. The only true freedom they have to hold is within themselves because everything else can be taken away from them. So writing becomes really infinitely more powerful for them.CNN: What changes have you seen in them? Stackable: I see women being restored to their families. I see them making a difference in other prisoners' lives. I see them changing the atmosphere within prison. And I think that writing is part of that. But underlying writing is a sense of self-worth and employment and agency. To have those things while you're in prison is just counter to the entire system.CNN: You start each new class with the women setting the rules.Stackable: I think in order to know that you matter you have to feel like you have a choice in something. So everything that we do in the class is to eliminate the hierarchy these women have always been part of. They've always been the bottom of it and even more so in prison. So we allow them to make the rules. Creating a safe place in the most unsafe place is at the heart of what we do. And from that writing flows easily. And then with writing comes healing and hope and change.CNN: What keeps you motivated? Stackable: I think ultimately it's because these women are worth it. They matter. I walk away from every class I teach encouraged and just honored to be there.There's no coincidence that prisons are often in out-of-the-way rural places. It's because we don't want to see them. We don't want to know what's happening. So for me to be able to tell their story and for them to tell their story that's the motivation.Want to get involved?

Brooklyn NY (CNN)As an emergency physician at Kings County Hospital Center Dr. Rob Gore has faced many traumatic situations that he'd rather forget. But some moments stick with him."Probably the worst thing that I've ever had to do is tell a 15-year-old's mother that her son was killed" Gore said. "If I can't keep somebody alive I've failed."  Gore a Brooklyn native finds violent injuries particularly hard to stomach -- a feeling compounded by the fact that many of the victims he treats are young men of color."When I became an ER doc my patients looked just like me" he said. "A lot of this stuff really hits home." According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention homicide is the No. 1 cause of death for black men ages 15 to 34.  "Conflict's not avoidable. But violent conflict is" Gore said. "Seeing a lot of the traumas that take place at work or in the neighborhood you realize 'I don't want this to happen anymore. What do we do about it?'"For Gore one answer is the Kings Against Violence Initiative -- known as KAVI -- which he started in 2009. Today the nonprofit has anti-violence programs in the hospital schools and broader community serving more than 250 young people. Victims of violence are more likely to be reinjured so the first place Gore wanted to work was in the hospital with an intervention program in which "hospital responders" assist victims of violence and their family -- a model pioneered at other hospitals. The idea is that reaching out right after someone has been injured reduces the likelihood of violent retaliation and provides a chance for the victim to address some of the circumstances that may have led to their injury. Gore started this program at his hospital with a handful of volunteers from KAVI. Today the effort is a partnership between KAVI and a few other nonprofits with teams on call 24/7.  Yet Gore wanted to prevent people from being violently injured in the first place. So in 2011 he and his group began working with a handful of at-risk students at a nearby high school. By the end of the year more than 50 students were involved. Today KAVI holds weekly workshops for male and female students in three schools teaching mediation and conflict resolution. The group also provides free mental health counseling for students who need one-on-one support."Violence is everywhere they turn -- home school neighborhood police" Gore said. "You want to make sure they can learn how to process deal with it and overcome it."While Gore still regularly attends workshops most are now led by peer facilitators -- recent graduates and college students some of whom are former KAVI members -- who serve as mentors to the students. School administrators say the program has been a success: lowering violence raising grades and sending many graduates on to college. "This is really about the community in which we live" he said. "This is my home. And I'm going to do whatever is possible to make sure people can actually thrive."CNN spoke to Gore about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.CNN: How did your background as a doctor influence your work?Dr. Rob Gore: I just started asking myself "Why does this stuff happen?" If we're just doing these Band-Aid approaches then they're going to be suffering with the same problems. Your perspective completely changes if the trauma becomes personal. I started looking at violence as a public health problem -- this preventable disease where if we intervene we could really change the scope of this. I want to preserve life and improve vitality and that has really inspired the work that we've been doing with KAVI.CNN: Why is the hospital responder program necessary and how does it work?Gore: When you have domestic violence patients everyone knows what to do -- you call the sex abuse response team and start taking care of their physical and psychosocial needs. But when a 16-year-old male is shot in front of his building often they'd just send him home. He's going back to the same building school -- the same situation where he got into trouble and he's expected to carry on normal life. No one has paid any attention to that kid's needs. Hospital responders are individuals from the same community who understand all the social economic even gang-related issues that might be impacting them. They are an advocate who makes sure that those patients are offered the same dignity as every other patient. They will follow up with the patients when they're on the hospital wards. They want to make sure that you have a safe place to go and a ride home. They identify the specific needs of that patient and work with the social workers who have access to other resources. And they keep following up even after the patient has been discharged. We want to make sure that they don't come back for repeat injuries and that they can be in a position to take care of themselves and their families.CNN: KAVI also has several community programs. What is their reach?Gore: Our community programs cover a lot. Our tutoring program is run by medical students and emergency medicine resident physicians; it's a way to build a bridge between the hospital and the community. Our afterschool program for middle school students is called KAVI YO which stands for Young Ones named in honor of Willis Young one of our hospital responders who was stabbed and died in 2015.We also have a summer camp where our high school students work with middle school students. Our students have so much potential. They just need somebody to help figure out how they can access it.  That's our ultimate goal -- we want to make sure the people we're serving are at their best.Want to get involved?

 (CNN)The death of Jamal Khashoggi continues to hang over the heads of both US President Donald Trump and his allied Saudi officials.On Thursday Saudi prosecutors formally charged 11 people over the journalist's killing five of whom will face the death penalty. Just hours later the Trump administration announced sanctions against 17 Saudi government officials. The powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was not of course among those blamed.The timing of the two courses of action was surely no coincidence. It seems both parties were hoping their responses together would shield the Crown Prince from growing accusations of involvement. But what a difference a day makes. On Friday the CIA concluded the Crown Prince personally ordered the journalist's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month a senior US official and a source familiar with the matter told CNN.US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert however said the government had not drawn any final conclusions about who was responsible adding "numerous unanswered questions" remained.Still the CIA's explosive assessment makes Riyadh's repeated denials that bin Salman was connected to Khashoggi's death much harder to swallow and if it's true the development may be a major blow to the special relationship Trump has fostered with the Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has offered so many narratives of how journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed that it's difficult to believe it will now tell the whole truth.Riyadh first claimed to know nothing about Khashoggi's disappearance but weeks later the Saudi attorney general finally admitted his murder had been premeditated. Saudi prosecutors on Thursday offered yet another version of events saying Khashoggi was killed by a lethal dose of a sedative in an abduction attempt gone wrong.Despite the reports about the CIA's findings Trump is sticking by his friends in the Middle East. Before he was briefed by the CIA on Saturday Trump repeated his belief in the Crown Prince's innocence saying he had been "told that he did not play a role" and that the country had been "a truly spectacular ally.""They give us a lot of jobs they give us a lot of business a lot of economic development" he said on Saturday.The CIA's assessment first reported by the Washington Post is based on a recording provided by the Turkish government and other evidence including US intelligence the senior US official said. Among that intelligence is a phone call from the Crown Prince's brother Khalid bin Salman and Khashoggi in which Kalid encourages the journalist to make the trip to the consulate according to the Post. Sources told the Post that Khalid made the call at his brother's command.Khalid denies the Post's reporting saying on Twitter he never spoke to Khashoggi by phone and "never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason."A Saudi embassy spokeswoman said in a statement the reported claims were false. "We have and continue to hear various theories without seeing the primary basis for these speculations."Trump's not aloneIt's not only Trump who would find a guilty Crown Prince a geopolitical problem. Soon after Khashoggi's death several world leaders called for an independent investigation. Those calls have turned to whispers in recent weeks and few other countries besides Canada are still talking of sanctions.Ayham Kamel head of Eurasia Group's Middle East practice said that is largely because few leaders want to see a faltering Saudi Arabia. "None of the key Western countries that have relations with Saudi Arabia-- the US and its allies -- want to destabilize the kingdom or create the situation where there is an open-power struggle" Kamel told CNN."There are too many hot spots in the Middle East and leaders don't want to add Saudi Arabia to the list. Open power struggles are difficult to predict and difficult to control."A challenge to bin Salman's authority would be particularly messy.The 33-year-old wields an extraordinary amount of power that the kingdom has never seen before among princes. He oversees almost every major agency in the country that deals with the economy security and intelligence.To put his dominance in perspective it was the Crown Prince who was tasked with shaking up the country's intelligence apparatus in response to Khashoggi's death.Bin Salman consolidated his position by intimidating his main rivals in a spectacular show of power. The Crown Prince had hundreds of senior government officials advisers and businessmen detained for months in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton transforming the hotel into a gilded prison in a masked "anti-corruption" drive. He has enemies within his own family too. Bin Salman skipped over dozens of other princes who would normally precede him as heir to the throne and any implication of the Crown Prince's involvement in the Khashoggi case could be enough of an opportunity for his rivals to reemerge."Once the dust settles on the Khashoggi killing pressure on the Crown Prince to share power with the rest of the family will remain if not increase" Stratfor the geopolitical intelligence firm wrote in a recent article.Saudis under the US' wingTrump was reluctant to issue sanctions on Saudi Arabia in the first place but was forced to under pressure from Congress and he is less likely to want to target the Crown Prince even if it means going against his own intelligence agencies. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has built a cozy relationship with bin Salman and was instrumental to designing the US' Saudi policy largely centered around the Crown Prince and his vision to modernize the kingdom's economy.In a conversation with Saudi King Salman two weeks after Khashoggi's death Trump not only seemed to buy into the monarch's version of events that he and the Crown Prince knew nothing at all of the killing he even laid out the Saudis' first narrative for them telling reporters that Khashoggi was murdered by "rogue killers" completely removed from the King and his son.It was the first sign in the case that Trump would side -- even coordinate -- with the King and Crown Prince. Then too he made clear that one journalist's life wasn't worth risking lucrative arms and trade deals (though he grossly exaggerated just how valuable those deals were to the US).It has been under this protective wing of the Trump administration that the Saudis have been able to pursue an aggressive foreign policy and act on with a sense of impunity according to Stratfor."For Riyadh the calculation that it can afford to upset relations temporarily with friends only to restore them later is a reasonable one" Stratfor wrote."Saudi Arabia's growing assertiveness is driven in part by the political cover it receives from its special relationship with the current US administration. The White House relies heavily on Saudi Arabia in its effort to contain their mutual adversary Iran. Washington also seeks Saudi cooperation to temper oil prices."Saudi Arabia is projecting that assertiveness around the region whether it be in a consulate in Turkey in the world of Lebanese politics or a brutal war in Yemen.Even Canada has felt the wrath of the Crown Prince's overreach. When officials in Ottawa demanded the release of imprisoned activists Riyadh froze new trade and investment deals suspended flights to Canada expelled Canada's ambassador to Saudi Arabia while recalling its own and even moved Saudi students studying there. Turkey's possible motivesThe greatest pressure on Saudi Arabia however has come from Turkey which says Khashoggi was strangled to death as soon as he arrived at the consulate and his body then dismembered in a premeditated murder.Turkish officials have been releasing information around Khashoggi's death drip by drip trying to draw out the world's interest and keep Riyadh in focus.Turkey has said for more than a month that it has audio evidence of how Khashoggi was killed and more recently President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country had shared that evidence with several Western allies.It is this drip feed of information that has forced Saudi officials to keep changing their story and that appears to have cornered them into admitting Khashoggi's murder was premeditated. But Turkey which is undergoing a brutal crackdown on journalists of its own is likely to have other motives in pursuing Saudi Arabia so aggressively Eurasia's Kamel said. "This is being used for geopolitical competition between Sunni powers in the region. Ankara and Riyadh are longtime competitors in the Middle East and Turkey is using this case to expand its regional power while ensuring Saudi Arabia's rise is contained"  Kamel said."The agenda Mohammed bin Salman has introduced on foreign policy is more Arab-centric not only containing Iranian influence but containing Turkish influence too. So Saudi Arabia reemerging as a leader of the Arab world doesn't necessarily align with Turkey's strategic interests. In the meantime Khashoggi's family is still hoping to discover where their relative's body -- or remains -- may be. The absence of Khashoggi's body at a funeral in an Istanbul mosque on Friday was a dark reminder that the whole truth has still not been revealed and may never be.,World
Paris (CNN)A protester was accidentally run over and killed by a car during a demonstration over rising fuel prices a top official in eastern France said Saturday. Mass demonstrations causing roadblocks across the country are part of the "gilets jaunes" or "yellow vests" movement which opposes mounting gas prices and eco-taxes on polluting forms of transport. The death occurred when a driver "panicked" and ran over someone after arriving at a blockade for an undeclared protest not far from the city of Lyon Louis Laugier the prefect of the Savoie region said at a news conference.A further 227 people were injured -- six severely -- in protests across the country and 73 people were taken into police custody the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Five police officers suffered slight injuries and one was severely injured. Another five gendarmes were hurt as well. Speaking about the death French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said: "That's the reason why we were worried to have people (who are) not experienced organizing protests."Ecology Minister François de Rugy called on citizens to "respect caution and safety recommendations" in order for protests to go ahead "without a new tragedy" in a tweet Saturday. He also offered his condolences to the family of the victim.More than 1 million people were expected to turn out Saturday for demonstrations across the country. Partway through the day the numbers were much lower than that.About 280000 people participated in more than 2000 demonstrations the Interior Ministry said."Honestly we're satisfied even if it's true we are not hundreds of thousands people here but still people have come. The day is not over yet and we're glad that there are no incidents here" Thierry Paul Valette who helped organize a protest on the Champs Elysées in Paris told CNN."We can't stand Macron's taxes any more. It's too much. We couldn't make ourselves heard through political parties or trade unions so we had to do something."The protest was billed as likely to be one of the toughest tests yet of Emmanuel Macron's 18-month-old presidency.Website blocage17novembre said protests were planned in all 95 of France's mainland departments while a petition on change.org calling on the French government to lower the cost of fuel has gotten more than 850000 signatures.In addition to concerns over spiraling fuel prices the protests also reflect long-running tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.Price hikeDiesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69) even hitting 1.53 euros in October according to UFIP France's oil industry federation. The price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil with Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October. French protesters are however not directing their anger at OPEC for reducing oil production or at the US administration for implementing tariffs on Iran crippling its oil exports. Macron is instead bearing the brunt of widespread French discontent with many protesters furious at the current leader's extension of environmental policies implemented under François Hollande's government. Notably taxes were increased by 8 centimes last January on diesel and by 4 centimes on petrol. Tax on diesel will also increase by another 6.4 centimes in 2019 and by 2.9 centimes for petrol. These rises follow many decades of under-taxation of diesel in France. Macron criticizedThe growing resentment has also been a springboard for partisan political attacks with opponents of Macron's centrist En Marche party attempting to energize their bases to fuel further revolt. "This government hasn't understood the anger of the French" Olivier Faure head of the French Socialist Party said Wednesday. "Macron has not heard the French" Laurent Wauquiez leader of the center-right party Les Républicains added in an interview for BFMTV and RMC radio. Meanwhile Macron's former nemesis Marine Le Pen leader of France's far-right National Rally said: "We were the first party to express our total support for this movement." Castaner hit back at Macron's opponents branding the protests "political" and accusing Les Républicains of being behind them. "It's a political protest with the Republicans behind it and it's irrational because the rising taxes have been compensated by the decline in the oil market" he told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV. "We hear the protests we hear the anger I know the situation but we have to explain that it's essential that we exit fossil fuels."  The minister said police would be present to break up any dangerous roadblocks. "I am asking for the roads to not be completely blocked" Castaner said. "Where there is a roadblock -- which means there's a risk for emergency services -- there will be police." Macron struck a more conciliatory tone in an interview Wednesday saying: "I hear the anger and it's a fundamental right in our society to be allowed to express it." He nevertheless admitted that he was "wary because many different people are trying to piggyback on this movement." Prime Minister Edouard Philippe also announced close to 500 million euros in aid to low-income motorists in a key concession Wednesday.CNN's Eva Tapiero reported from Paris while Matthew Robinson and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Buenos Aires (CNN)A missing Argentine naval submarine has been found a year and a day after it vanished in the South Atlantic with 44 crew members on board authorities said Saturday.The wreckage of the ARA San Juan which "suffered an implosion" was found about 870 meters (2850 feet) down on the ocean floor Argentine naval Capt. Gabriel Attis later told reporters in Buenos Aires.Family members at the navy headquarters were shown three images of the remains of the San Juan's "sail" or tower and bow sections.Hours before the wreckage was positively identified the Argentine navy tweeted an image of a point of interest on the seabed suggesting that a 60-meter-long object might be the missing vessel. An American company contracted by Argentina located the submarine.Footage showed relatives of the lost crew members grieving in the northern port of Mar del Plata the submarine's home base as they received the news the submarine had been found. The vessel's condition remains unclear.Defense Minister Oscar Aguad told reporters at a press conference Saturday that Argentina does not have the capability of recovering the sunken submarine."No we don't have the means to go down to that depth of the sea" he said adding that authorities "do not have the equipment to bring the submarine out from such a depth."The ARA San Juan disappeared November 15 last year off Argentina's coast about midway on its journey from Ushuaia in the country's south to Mar del Plata.The Argentine navy said in the following days that the vessel's captain had reported a short circuit in the vessel's battery system shortly before the last known contact. The short circuit was caused by seawater entering the vessel's "snorkel" a tube that reaches the surface to refresh the vessel's air and recharge the batteries the captain said in a call to his commander on land.Days later it emerged that a sound consistent with an explosion had been detected in the ocean near the sub's last known location by the United States and an international nuclear weapons monitor.The hunt for the vessel -- which at its height involved 28 ships and nine airplanes from 11 nations including the United States and United Kingdom -- centered on an area roughly 900 kilometers (559 miles) off the Argentine coast.Relatives of crew members prayed for their return in Mar del Plata even as hopes dwindled that the diesel-powered submarine would be found before the air supply ran out.The Argentine navy called off its rescue operation about two weeks after the sub's disappearance saying there was "no chance of survival" for its crew but search efforts continued.Among those lost was Eliana Maria Krawczyk Argentina's first female submarine officer.Ocean Infinity a US company specializing in deep water search and recovery began looking for the ARA San Juan in September using autonomous underwater vehicles operated by a team on board its ship Seabed Constructor the firm saidThree Argentine navy officers and four family members of the crew of the ARA San Juan were invited on board as observers for the search mission Ocean Infinity said.Oliver Plunkett Ocean Infinity's CEO said in a statement he hoped the discovery of the submarine would lead to "questions being answered and lessons learned" that would prevent a similar incident in the future. Ocean Infinity told CNN on Saturday its search vessel is still conducting an analysis of the debris field found around the wreck. The company confirmed it has the ability to salvage remains of the submarine should the Argentines ask. "Next steps are a matter for the authorities to determine" Plunkett said. "We would be pleased to assist with a recovery operation but at the moment we are focused on completing imaging of the debris field."The vessel's loss raised questions over the navy's maintenance of its submarine fleet.The ARA San Juan was an old diesel submarine built in Germany in the mid-1980s but was refitted with new engines and batteries around five years before its disappearance Peter Layton a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute at Griffith University in Australia told CNN last year.The sub was designed to have a shelf life of around 30 years which had expired he said. If intact after the explosion the hull could have been expected to withstand ocean depths up to around 500 to 600 meters he said. Below that it would buckle under pressure.CNN's Daniel Silva Fernandez reported from Miami and Ignacio Grimaldi from Buenos Aires while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

 (CNN)From Nollywood actresses to afrobeat superstars August Udoh has captured them all. He's lauded as Nigeria's most talented celebrity photographer but it is the stories of those on the very margins of society that are important to him. The fighters captured in series "Dambe" are ordinary working men. "They have normal jobs. Some are truck drivers others mechanics" Udoh told CNN. But with one exception - their downtime is spent competing in martial arts sport dambe. It's a traditional form of boxing where competitors fight with a single bounded hand for three rounds. As Udoh's series title suggests this martial arts club is underground its presence spread only through word-of-mouth."I had a security guard from the north who was talking about it and he showed me a video posted online" says Udoh. "I thought this is actually true - there is an underground fighting club that a lot of people in Nigeria don't know about."One armed 'kill'Dambe's history stems from the Hausa people in northern Nigeria and is thought to date back centuries. It was local butchers by trade who competed. The stronger punching hand known as the spear is traditionally tied with cotton and rope while the other hand shields against opponent's punches. Contestants can also kick -  the fight ends when an opponent falls to the ground - referred to as a "kill".  Traditionally the cloth bound hand was dipped in resin and covered in shards of glass - this has been banned. Boxing gloves were introduced in some areas to make the sport safer. But many still consider it a brutal sport due to the injuries inflicted. Viral videosLong forgotten the sport is gaining popularity thanks to dedicated YouTube channels such as Dambe Warriors which launched last year and has garnered more than 57000 subscribers and 15 million views.While Udoh's images present the raw unfettered energy of the art's young competitors dambe is a poor man's sport. Fighters are almost certainly low income earners. For them it's a chance to make money explains Udoh. Tickets for fights are often sold at around 500 Naira ($1.38) per person. "Usually the fight organizers make 50000 Naira ($137) a day."Victorious competitors can earn anywhere from $20 up to $500 which they can use to feed and take care of their families."As a fighter - champions earn a lot" Udoh said. "If you've won a lot of fights then you get paid more. There is a hierarchy thing where you attract high fees because you bring in the crowd."  Gifts are also given by fans. "People send money back to their parents one fighter was given a house."Nigeria's wealth gapUdoh spent a week traveling around Niger and Ogun states talking to the boxers who compete. The photographs raise questions on the widening regional inequalities within the country - which has been widely criticized by humanitarian groups. Those living in often wealthier states in the south have no concept of how their northern neighbors live explains Udoh. "I have friends who have not been out of Lagos since they were born - so they don't know."  "People don't realize every other state is not like Lagos" he adds. Read more: Nigeria overtakes India in extreme poverty rankingThe photographs are about shedding light upon such regional disparities Udoh explains. In 2012 he spent a month traveling around Kogi to capture the country's flood victims. Kogi a northern state was the worst affected by the 2012 floods. Some 623900 people were said to have been displaced as a result and 152575 hectares of farmland destroyed. Many of the victims homes and infrastructure have not yet been rebuilt says Udoh. The towns today remain virtually unchanged since the floods.

"I really felt their pain but there was nothing I could do."Nigeria's recent September floods has killed nearly 200 people in the country and displaced around 176000 according to Nigeria's Emergency Management Agency.Udoh notes the power of his images stem from the stories behind them. He adds: "I want to convince people to look outside of Lagos by telling these stories with my pictures.",World
 (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel is making the most of her remaining time in office.  This week she made an uncharacteristically lively speech to EU parliament in Strasbourg and though she had stated many of the ideas before this time she was much more bold in outlining what she hopes will be a stronger more integrated EU.  "We should work on the vision to one day create a true European army" she told the chamber giving her full backing to one of many eurozone reforms called for by French President Emmanuel Macron.  She also had a dig at the nationalist policies of US President Donald Trump saying: "The times that we could rely on others without reservation are over.  That means we Europeans have to take our destiny into our hands if we want to survive as a community."She received a standing ovation for her speech -- and a few jeers.  At one point she grinned at MEPs and said: "I'm really enjoying this! I seem to be annoying a few people here today!"For a supposedly lame duck the Chancellor was in fine form.As her potential successors jockey for position before the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party conference next month Merkel is free to focus on securing her legacy. To do that she also needs to ensure that she's not pushed out before her time is up in 2021. So far she has the support of Wolfgang Schauble her former finance minister current Bundestag President and also the eminence gris of the CDU.    "She's taken the right decision at the right time" Schauble told Deutsche Welle's Tim Sebastian after her announcement. "Once elected as chancellor you can only be thrown out without your own agreement if there is a majority in parliament who elects another chancellor. That's unthinkable cannot be imagined in this parliament. So her position is constitutionally strong." The public seems to support that view.  An Infratest dimap poll released Thursday showed that 56% of respondents want Merkel to stay for the remaining three years in office before the next general election. Her decision to step down may have also contributed to a drop in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) rendering irrelevant its key demand for Merkel to resign.For the last week Merkel has been using her public speeches to rally support for the EU as it faces multiple crises from Brexit to Italy's budget defiance. In Strasbourg she gave a pointed warning to the Italian government:  "Whoever tries to resolve problems by just taking on more debt while ignoring previous commitments is placing the fundamentals of stability and strength that underpin the euro into doubt" she said.But Merkel is also sounding the alarm that increasing nationalism is threatening democracy and the liberal world order that underpins the EU. Last week she chose to speak out at the memorial for Kristallnacht or the "Night of Broken Glass" the 1938 rampage of state-sponsored violence by the Nazi regime that targeted Jewish communities and resulted in widespread looting and destruction of Jewish properties across Germany and Austria.  "There are two urgent questions that we need to answer" she said at Berlin's Rykestrasse Syangogue one of the 1400 synagogues that was set ablaze that night. "First what did we really learn from the Holocaust this rupture of civilization?  And second to the first question:  Are our democratic institutions sufficiently strong so that an increase of anti-Semitism or even if a majority presents anti-Semitism can it be prevented in the future?"She continued: "We must not allow our societies to be divided into us and them we and them we versus others. Every man has the right and can claim to be seen as an individual by the state. Secondly democracy is the best of all feasible social systems.  Even though life in a democracy may well be complicated on occasion. Democracy is more than to ensure majorities. It relies on balance. On a balance between majority and minority -- between government and opposition. It relies on the division of powers." Merkel also warned that some segments of society were feeling left behind and looking to populist leaders offering "simple answers" and a "brutalization of language."On Friday the Chancellor turned to the domestic task of healing the rifts in German society. Specifically she traveled to the eastern town of Chemnitz where the stabbing of a local man in August triggered spontaneous violent demonstrations against Merkel and her migration policy by right-wing extremists. Merkel answered questions from local residents at a town hall alongside the mayor of Chemnitz but for some of her critics it was too little too late. They pointed out that it took three months for Merkel to visit the town.    "I am a polarizing figure I know that" she said explaining that she did not want to escalate tensions in the city earlier. "I did not want to come here in such heated moments."But only a few hundred came out to demonstrate against the Chancellor far fewer than in previous protests. Merkel stayed for more than an hour patiently answering questions from a selected group of local residents. She admitted Germany's decision to welcome more than a million refugees between 2015 and 2016 was not organized in a way the public approved of and acknowledged a number of high-profile crimes committed by asylum seekers. She also agreed that political decisions needed to be more transparent to the public.One woman angrily confronted Merkel about her famous phrase "We can do it" which was designed to bolster the country in the midst of the 2015 refugee influx: "What about finding an answer to the chaos to this so-called 'We can do it!'?  We all thought you would admit: yes we made mistakes and we need to fix that quickly" said the woman.Merkel responded:  "I did say 'We can do it' because I saw that what was coming was a tremendous task.  What kind of chancellor would I be if I had said:  'No we cannot do it'?"  What she regretted Merkel said was not proactively creating a better refugee policy before tens of thousands began streaming into Europe. "I knew we had to do something" she said. "My mistake was prior to the arrival of the refugees. That we did not help earlier to decide who can come to us and who cannot.  I have seen from that we were not prepared for such a task."For the last 13 years Merkel has navigated the country through political crises and dilemmas. Now she's focused on securing her legacy.But beyond the big speeches Merkel also seems to be devoting her time to events like this explaining her decisions to the voters who trusted her to lead the country for so long. ,World
 (CNN)A maritime blunder then a ruinous rescue attempt has left a multi-million dollar warship under NATO command almost entirely submerged in a Norwegian fjord.A large hole was torn into the side of KNM Helge Ingstad when it collided with a Malta-registered oil tanker Sola TS in the early hours of November 8. The frigate one of five in the Scandinavian country's navy had been moving around inner fjords in western Norway for navigation training before it collided with the 250-meter long tanker (820 ft) that was sailing out of an oil terminal. While military crew reportedly drove the vessel up on underwater rocks in order to prevent it from sinking the tanker emerged relatively unscathed. But efforts to move the 5500-ton warship to a safe place went catastrophically wrong this week after cables attached to hold it in place snapped. Now all that remains above the waterline is the frigate's top antennas and radar leading local media to speculate how a ship designed for war failed to avoid a slow-moving 150000-ton tanker. Norway's military has remained tight lipped about the situation which injured eight of the 137 people on board. Navy communications officer Torill Herland told CNN that whatever occurred during the accident near Bergen is now "police work."A joint Norwegian and Maltese investigation is now also underway to try and determine the cause. Similar cases involving US Navy destroyers over the last two years were found to have been down to avoidable errors according to Alex Pape Editor of Jane's Fighting Ships but he said it is too early to speculate on this incident. "Warships particularly surface combatants like frigates are generally designed to withstand a degree of battle damage" Pape told CNN. "However even for well protected warships if they sustain sufficient damage particularly in adjacent compartments and below the waterline the resulting flooding may be too much for pumps and/or the crew's damage control efforts to cope with and the ship will list capsize or sink.Pape said this particular incident suggests that in addition to a visible large hole torn in the starboard side there is substantial damage to the hull near or below the waterline which then rapidly flooded the aft compartments of the ship.Heavy chainsThe attempted rescue of the frigate has certainly raised eyebrows.Jan Vindenes is the general manager of Sotra Anchor & Chain whose products have been used in numerous shipwreck recoveries including that of the Costa Concordia -- the cruise ship which crashed into rocks off the coast of Italy in 2012 killing 32 people on board. He thinks chains could have been used to secure the frigate. "They used some wire to secure the frigate but unfortunately it snapped. We say that chain is stronger and better than wire.""We have chain that can hold 2000 tonnes and our chain was used to raise the Costa Concordia which was very much bigger than this frigate" he added. A costly crashGiven that the frigate is one of only five operated by the Norwegian navy its loss is likely to impact on national and NATO operations. But the country's military will have to carefully consider the cost of salvaging and repairing it for active service. Pape told CNN: "Curiously if the ship is not repaired the reduction of one ship that needs to be maintained upgraded manned and used over the remaining 20 years of its life will mean that cost for the navy could go down in the long run however with a loss of capability." Pape estimates that a decision to salvage it repair it and return it to service would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. "The total cost could be similar to the cost of a new ship."The financial impact of the crash is likely to be felt well beyond the military as it triggered the shutdown of a North Sea crude export terminal Norway's largest gas processing plant and several offshore fields.In total these five oil and gas fields produce around 400 million Norwegian krone ($48 million) a day or 17 million krone ($2 million) an hour. Since the oil companies pay 78 percent taxes to the state for production the two-day shutdown ultimately resulted in a substantial economic loss for the nation national broadcaster NRK reported.Fortunately the oil tanker -- which was carrying almost 100 million liters of oil -- was not seriously damaged in the accident. The Norwegian Coastal Administration said it had cleaned up some diesel and helicopter fuel that was spilled in the incident but that has been largely contained according to Truls Gulowsen head of Greenpeace in Norway. "A major leakage would have constituted an unbelievable environmental disaster that easily could have impacted most of Norway's western coastline" Gulowsen told CNN. The crash led to a small amount of diesel and 10000 liters of helicopter fuel to leak from the vessel which has largely been contained and recovered he said. Gulowsen added however that "the situation is not yet stable and the vessel is still under water. The frigate had additional 385000 liters of marine diesel but this has not leaked" The Norwegian Navy is now considering ways to raise the vessel according to the military's chief of staff Admiral Nils Andreas Stensones."It's very hard for a navy to lose a vessel" he told AFP. ,World
 (CNN)The parents of Dr. Rio Nanda Putrama who died in the Indonesia airplane disaster last month that killed all 189 passengers on board have sued Boeing for its alleged "unsafe design" of the 737 Max 8 aircraft. The lawsuit filed Thursday in the Circuit Court of Cook County Illinois where Boeing is headquartered centers on a new safety feature that can cause the 737 Max 8 aircraft to "auto-dive" in certain situations.The suit alleges this is a change from prior Boeing 737 designs and that the company failed to communicate the change."At no relevant time prior to the crash...did Boeing adequately warn Lion Air or its pilots of unsafe condition caused by the new 'auto-diving' design" the suit alleges.Putrama was flying to Pangkal Pinang in Indonesia to get married according to his parent's lawyers.It is the latest headache for Boeing which has faced mounting pressure in the wake of the crash.On Wednesday a top Lion Air official joined a US pilots' group in alleging the company failed to warn pilots about the potential hazards of the new safety feature implicated in the crash.Zwingli Silalahi Lion Air's operational director said the manual did not tell pilots that in certain situations the plane's stall-prevention system could automatically trigger a response such as lowering the airplane's nose to prevent or exit a stall."We don't have that in the manual of the Boeing 737 Max 8. That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation" Zwingli said.Representatives from American United and Southwest airlines each said Friday that Boeing did not include information in its flight crew manual that explained the functions of new features found on the aircraft.  Because that information was not spelled out with specificity the airlines said their pilots were not clear on all of the functionality of a key system in the aircraft. The airlines say Boeing has now communicated what the new features are and how they work and pilots are  aware of them as well.  American and United airlines said the revelation of new information will not require additional pilot training.Investigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.The airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) a labor union that represents American Airlines pilots of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features. On Thursday American Airlines backed up their pilots' claims.Lion Air Flight 610 crashed shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta on October 29. Investigators believe the Max 8 plane may have experienced problems with several sensors.Boeing said last week that a safety bulletin issued to aircraft operators in the wake of the crash was merely meant to reinforce existing procedures. Both Lion Air and the APA reject the company's assertion."They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft" Capt. Dennis Tajer a spokesman for the APA group told CNN on Tuesday. "The bulletin is not reaffirming it's enlightening and adding new info."Zwingli added that Boeing's safety bulletin did not suggest additional training for pilots operating that aircraft. "We didn't receive any information from Boeing or from regulator about that additional training for our pilots" he said.Zwingli said that if the result of the ongoing investigation -- conducted by Indonesia's National Transportation Commission the US National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing -- found that additional training was necessary Lion Air pilots would undertake it.On Wednesday a Boeing spokesperson said in an email that the company could not "discuss specifics of an ongoing investigation" and that the company had "provided two updates for our operators around the world that re-emphasize existing procedures for these situations.""We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing" the spokesperson said.The head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN on Wednesday that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the Max 8 planes but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.On Tuesday the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the Max 8 planes "the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft."Journalist Masrur Jamaluddin contributed to this report. ,World
Hong Kong (CNN)Every day before work Kevin Lau stopped for breakfast at a restaurant in Sai Wan Ho a residential area in eastern Hong Kong. It was a routine as ingrained in him as brushing his teeth and it nearly cost him his life. On a morning in February 2014 Lau -- a senior editor at the popular upmarket daily Ming Pao -- had parked his car on a street near the restaurant when two men wearing motorcycle helmets and gloves rushed up to him. One slashed at Lau with a meat cleaver knocking him to the floor where he lay bleeding with deep wounds in his back and legs as his assailants ran off. With what a court later described as "superhuman calm" Lau phoned for an ambulance and was rushed to hospital. He survived and two men with triad links -- Yip Kim-wah and Wong Chi-wah -- were arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. While Yip and Wong were later jailed they did not reveal who had commissioned and paid for the attack one of several against journalists in Hong Kong at that time including the firebombing of the home and office of Jimmy Lai publisher of the Apple Daily a tabloid highly critical of the Chinese government.In the wake of the attack against Lau several thousand journalists and supporters took to the streets dressed in black and carrying banners which read "They Can't Kill Us All" in a defiant show of support for press freedom in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. It was a tense period for journalists in Hong Kong. The sense of despair was lifted temporarily by the so-called Umbrella Revolution mass pro-democracy protests that broke out in late 2014. Those demonstrations saw the international media spotlight swing onto Hong Kong and the local press rose to the challenge covering every aspect of the protests and their fallout and winning multiple awards in the process. Indeed in the wake of the protests reporters' assessment of press freedom in the city rose for the first time in years according to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA). But just as the Umbrella protests eventually gave way to widespread disillusionment as hoped for reforms never panned out and multiple prominent pro-democracy figures were jailed recent weeks have seen a collapse in confidence among the city's small journalist community and renewed fears of self-censorship prosecution and violence. On November 9 this year the HKJA warned of the "death knell of freedom of speech" in the city.Keeping quiet  Under Hong Kong's de facto constitution the Basic Law residents are guaranteed "freedom of speech of the press and of publication" rights that are not granted or protected in mainland China. While this means there is little top-down control of media in Hong Kong self-censorship within the local press has been widely reported both by front-line reporters and editors who have left publications they felt were unwilling to stand up to the government or corporate pressure. One of the best descriptions of self-censorship and its pernicious power which sometimes outstrips that of more aggressive control comes from China scholar Perry Link. "(The) government's censorial authority in recent times has resembled not so much a man-eating tiger or fire-snorting dragon as a giant anaconda coiled in an overhead chandelier" Link wrote about academic self-censorship in China. "Normally the great snake doesn't move. It doesn't have to. It feels no need to be clear about its prohibitions. Its constant silent message is 'You yourself decide' after which more often than not everyone in its shadow makes his or her large and small adjustments -- all quite 'naturally'." While mainland China has a massive formal censorship apparatus controlling all aspects of society from movies and music to the Internet and book publishing much of what affects people on a day to day level is closer to self-censorship.Social media firms for example employ hundreds of censors to police what their users say but for the most part they do so without guidance or direction from the central government second guessing what their bosses and by extension the Communist Party's official censors will disapprove of. In this context self-censorship becomes more effective the more unclear the boundaries and the greater the repercussions for potentially stepping across them. This could be seen in Hong Kong in the wake of the attack on Lau as the chance of a violent response to a story suddenly seemed a real possibility to many reporters compounding existing fears about the "wrong" story costing the journalist their job or resulting in costly legal proceedings. For over a decade however even as warnings grew about self-censorship by Hong Kong reporters and media ownership was consolidated by a few China-friendly businesspeople the foreign press has largely operated unfettered a stark contrast to China where international reporters regularly harassed ejected from the country and their local colleagues arrested and jailed. That all changed this year. Action reactionThe Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong is positioned half way up a hill on a busy windy road with narrow pavements and multiple lanes in the city's Central district.It's not a good venue to protest outside of and yet in August several dozen people squeezed themselves into police cordoned-off areas opposite and next to the club bearing banners accusing the elite institution of being involved in a "conspiracy to split Hong Kong from China." Inside the focus of the protests Andy Chan sat looking calm and composed as he prepared to give a speech arguing for the city's independence. He chatted casually with FCC staff and laughed when fire department officials rushed into the building carrying axes in response to an apparent hoax call. Within days of the event taking place Chan's Hong Kong National Party was officially banned under public security laws the first time they had ever been used to go after a political organization. The FCC itself meanwhile was facing a storm of publicity amid calls for it to lose the lease to its property and potentially even its license to operate. By October those fears appeared misguided until Victor Mallet an editor at the Financial Times who had hosted Chan in his capacity as acting-FCC President put in for a routine visa renewal. Compared to China and many other countries in the region (including ones which boast about being democracies) Hong Kong is an incredibly easy place to get a journalist visa but Mallet had his refused an almost unprecedented move the government has yet to explain but nearly everyone else has connected to the Chan talk. While the local government has consistently denied that Mallet's ejection was anything to do with press freedom the failure to provide an alternate explanation as well as the facts of the case have left most to draw their own conclusions. "We ... are deeply concerned that with this action taken with no stated or apparent legal basis Hong Kong's special place as a bastion of free expression and a free press has been eroded" 17 former presidents of the FCC wrote in an open letter to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after Mallet was denied entry to the city as a visitor on November 8. New normalWhile reporters working in mainland China are obviously subject to the pressures and concerns that can lead to self-censorship -- fear of violence fear of being ejected from the country or even jailed -- there is an additional factor in Hong Kong in that the city has long been a place where many expats including foreign reporters are more like immigrants getting permanent residency and raising their children rather than moving on after a few years. Being ejected from a country one never had any intention of living in can though most journalists would not admit it be a boon to career prospects significantly building the reporter's profile and reputation. But being forced to leave somewhere you intended to raise your family and settle down can be devastating and questions naturally arise over whether any given story or event or interview is worth that? Recent weeks have seen two incidents which appear from the outside to be clear cut cases of self-censorship. The specter of the attack on Lau as well as the 2015 disappearance of several Hong Kong booksellers was raised on November 2 when the organizers of a show by Chinese dissident artist Badiucao canceled the event a day before it was due to take place alleging "threats made by the Chinese authorities relating to the artist." This was followed by the cancellation of a talk by another Chinese exile novelist Ma Jian at Tai Kwun an art space which has received government funding as part of a series of events connected to the Hong Kong International Literary Festival.In a statement the Director of Tai Kwun Timothy Calnin said organizers "do not want Tai Kwun to become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual.""The cancellation appears to be at the very least an act of self-censorship which would add to a growing list of incidents of suppression of free expression in Hong Kong" said Jason Y. Ng president of PEN Hong Kong a pro-free speech organization."It is all the more jarring that the decision was made by a publicly funded venue that claims to celebrate and support the arts and creativity" added Ng.The self-censorship charge appeared to be confirmed when Tai Kwun abruptly reversed its decision and agreed to host Ma after all. "Ma has made public statements which clarify that his appearances in Hong Kong are as a novelist and that he has no intention to use Tai Kwun as a platform to promote his personal political interests" Calnin said in a statement.  Over all of this -- Mallet's visa refusal Badiucao's cancelled show Andy Chan's banned party and all the protests and demonstrations they inspired -- hangs a long delayed anti-sedition provision contained within the Basic Law the city's de facto constitution. Article 23 of Basic Law instructs the local government to "enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason secession sedition subversion against the Central People's Government ... and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies." Attempts to implement the law in 2003 sparked massive street protests which eventually saw it shelved but it has remained a priority of the central government and current leader Carrie Lam has vowed to create "suitable conditions" for passing the law though she has not outlined any timetable.While the Hong Kong government has shown it is not lacking in powers to go after protesters or dampen expression Article 23 would massively expand the amount of forbidden topics in a city already nervous about its freedoms and possibly even end its role as a hub for international media in Asia. Speaking to reporters at the Tai Kwun event Ma Jian said people nevertheless need to "have the courage to break" through self-censorship. "The freedom to speak is the basis of our civilization" he added. "We have to safeguard our freedom of expression. We have to safeguard our civilization."Disclosure: James Griffiths is a member of the Hong Kong Journalists Association and sits on the organization's press freedom committee. ,World
Seoul (CNN)North Korea has tested a "newly developed ultramodern" weapon in an event supervised by leader Kim Jong Un state media said Friday amid faltering nuclear disarmament negotiations with the United States.Very little is known about the weapon or whether it is even new but the test is the latest sign that Pyongyang is prepared to return to a more militaristic relationship with Washington if talks continue to go poorly. "He's tiptoeing towards a more aggressive posture in negotiations with the US and he's signaling that he's not going to give way and can simply return to his old practices if (the US) don't change their approach" Josh Pollack senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterrey told CNN.North Korea's state news agency KCNA announced the test on Friday morning providing no details on the location of the event and little information about the weapon itself other than it was "tactical" and had been commissioned "personally" by Kim's father and predecessor Kim Jong Il.A South Korean government source with military knowledge told CNN the weapon was likely a piece of long-range artillery "likely to be a multiple rocket launcher.""As it is a tactical weapon test we do not view it as a North Korean military provocation" the source said.Deteriorating relationsIt marks the first time Kim has publicly attended such a blatantly military-focused event since his high-profile summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and US President Donald Trump in early 2018."Chairman Kim Jong Il had chosen personally and directed step by step with his special attention paid to it was born at last" the KCNA article said."(Kim Jong Un) added that the weapon is just like a posthumous weapon and he missed Kim Jong Il very much while seeing the great success of its test."Despite huge hopes for a breakthrough following the international summits with Moon and Trump little progress has been made in recent months. On Thursday US Vice President Mike Pence said the US was backing down on a requirement for North Korea to provide a full list of nuclear and missile sites before a second meeting between Trump and Kim.Meanwhile an official with the North Korean Foreign Ministry said on November 5 that if the US doesn't start removing sanctions on Pyongyang Kim could restart "building up nuclear forces."In a separate development on Friday North Korea announced it would deport a US citizen who it claimed had crossed the border "illegally" from China.The man identified as Bruce Byron Lowrance reportedly entered North Korea on October 16 saying he was under "the control of the US Central Intelligence Agency" at the time according to KCNA.A spokesman for the US Embassy in Seoul told CNN he was unable to comment on individual cases "for privacy concerns." CNN has reached out to the US State Department and the South Korean government for further comment.In 2017 a man with the same name was deported from South Korea after he was caught wandering near the North Korean border according to the LA Times. They said he wanted to "help resolve the conflict" between Washington and Pyongyang.'Veiled threat'Pollack said the weapon test was the latest "veiled threat" from Pyongyang to US that if progress wasn't made soon a more hostile relationship could be back on the table."What kind of weapon this may be is perfectly ambiguous ... but they did attribute it to the Academy of National Defense Sciences and they are associated with the missile program" he said.Shin Beom-chol a researcher at the Seoul-based Asan Institute said although the exact type of weapon was unknown it was unlikely to be a missile as South Korea would have detected it."North Korea did not go on into any further detail about this test because they probably didn't want the situation escalating out of proportion" he told CNN.Speaking after the announcement of the weapon's test South Korean Unification Ministry deputy spokeswoman Lee Eu-gene downplayed the significance of the event saying Kim had been continuing his inspections in the military sector "intermittently."CNN's Sophie Jeong contributed to this article.,World

 (CNN)Japan Airlines has moved to update its rules on drinking alcohol after its pilots failed breathalyzer tests in a series of incidents.It has been reported that Japan Airlines pilots have failed breathalyzer tests 19 times since August 2017 when a more sensitive breathalyzer was introduced for in-house checks.Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun Thursday cited unnamed airline officials in a report that said failed tests resulted in delays to 12 domestic flights.Passengers were told the delays were due to "crew health conditions" and staff made no mention of alcohol levels.The latest report follows news that a Japan Airlines pilot admitted being almost 10 times over the legal alcohol limit at London Heathrow airport in October.Katsutoshi Jitsukawa 42 was arrested after failing an alcohol test shortly before a flight to Tokyo. A few days earlier fellow Japanese airline All Nippon Airways suffered delays after a pilot was taken ill after drinking.Eight of the 25 domestic Japanese airlines don't impose alcohol tests on pilots who are about to fly according to a survey carried out by Asahi Shimbun another Tokyo-based newspaper.In the face of growing concern about alcohol abuse among pilots Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways held meetings with the Japanese government Friday."We feel deeply responsible for causing the (Jitsukawa) incident that should never have happened" said Japan Airlines President Yuji Akasaka at a press conference after the meetings. The airline said in a statement that it has extended the drinking ban for pilots to 24 hours prior to flying and some ground staff will now be subject to breathalyzer tests. Akasaka will also take a 20% pay cut as a result of the Jitsukawa incident reports Mainichi Shimbun.While the Japanese aviation industry deals with these issues Japan Airlines executives may prefer to look back on brighter days.In July Japan Airlines received an award for the best economy seat at the prestigious Skytrax World Airline awards widely regarded as the aviation industry's equivalent of the Oscars.,World
 (CNN)Almost four decades on from the collapse of Pol Pot's tyrannical communist regime an international tribunal has ruled that the Khmer Rouge committed genocide a landmark verdict that is hoped will bring closure to millions of Cambodians.More than 1.7 million people or approximately a fifth of Cambodia's population are believed to have died from forced labor starvation and execution under the Khmer Rouge which ruled the country between 1975 and 1979. On Friday the regime's two most senior surviving members Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan now 92 and 87 were found by the court to be guilty of genocide of Vietnamese in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979. Nuon Chea was also found guilty of genocide against the Cham ethnic group in Cambodia during that time. In addition the pair were found guilty of murder extermination deportation enslavement imprisonment torture persecution on political religious and racial grounds and other inhumane acts.Both men were sentenced to life in prison.Nuon Chea known in the regime as "Brother Number Two" and Khieu Samphan known as "Brother Number Four" are already serving life sentences in Cambodia for crimes against humanity. Friday's sentences will be merged with their existing sentences. Phil Robertson Deputy Asia Director for Human Rights Watch told CNN the conviction should be celebrated."This has been a long time coming and obviously there's been a tremendous amount of time taken. But you know this conviction is hugely important and I think no one should discount the importance of this action today" said Robertson. "(To prove) the intent of the Khmer Rouge was to wipe these people out would be something that required a lot of time and a lot of expertise. It required a deep dive into Khmer Rouge archives. And so the importance I think was that they get this verdict right and that it was based on incontrovertible evidence."UN-backed courtFriday's decision was delivered by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) which is based in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. The court is a special United Nations-backed tribunal that was formed in 2006 to prosecute senior Khmer Rouge leaders and other regime figures.Prior to Friday's convictions the ECCC has delivered only three verdicts. In addition to 2014 case which found Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan guilty of crimes against humanity the court also sentenced Kaing Guek Eav commonly known by his alias Duch to life imprisonment in 2010 for war crimes crimes against humanity murder and torture. Kaing Guek Eav was the commandant of the notorious Tuol Sleng S-21 prison in Phnom Penh where more than 14000 people died.The ECCC's glacial pace in securing only three convictions in more than a decade at a cost of more than $260 million has been widely criticized especially given the suspects were nearing the end of their natural lives.However former ECCC investigator Craig Etcheson previously told CNN that public opinion surveys had consistently shown that a large majority of the Cambodian public supported the ECCC process."I would suggest that with upwards of two million people killed during the Khmer Rouge regime a $200 million dollar tribunal works out to roughly $100 per murder victim. Surely that is not an excessive price to seek justice for such a monumental crime" he said.Pol Pot's right-hand manNuon Chea born in 1926 was Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot's brother-in-law and was considered his right-hand man and a key ideologist throughout the regime's reign of terror.Trained in law in Bangkok the 88-year-old was second-ranked in the Communist Party of Kampuchea (as the Khmer Rouge is officially known) and served a short stint as Democratic Kampuchea's prime minister.During a his trial in 2014 prosecutors at the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) described him as an extremist who "crossed the line from revolutionary to war criminal responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians."Following the collapse of Democratic Kampuchea in 1979 he remained a leading Khmer Rouge figure in the years the movement operated as a rebel guerrilla force in Cambodia's west. He surrendered in 1998 striking a deal with the government that allowed him to live as a free man near the Thai border until his arrest in 2007 according to the ECCC.In his final statement to the court Nuon Chea admitted he carried "moral responsibility" for events during the period but also affirmed his innocence according to the ECCC."The CPK's policy and plan were solely designed to one purpose only to liberate the country from the colonization imperialism exploitation extreme poverty and invasion from neighboring countries" he said."The CPK's policy was clear and specific: it wanted to create an equal society where people were the master of the country ... The CPK's movement was not designed to kill people or destroy the country. My hope and wishes were betrayed by those who destroyed the movement."Like many other Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan studied in Paris publishing his doctoral dissertation on "Cambodia's economy and industrial development." On his return home he became a professor and then took on a senior government position before joining the Khmer Rouge rebels.In 1976 he became the head of state of Democratic Kampuchea and in 1987 years after the fall of Democratic Kampuchea he replaced Pol Pot as the head of the Khmer Rouge after the former's retirement.Throughout the previous 2014 trial he expressed remorse for the suffering of victims at one point offering Buddhist prayers for the souls of those who had died. But he repeatedly expressed his position that he was merely a figurehead with no role in Khmer Rouge policy.CNN's Ben Westcott contributed to this report,World
Jerusalem (CNN)Israel will pick a date for early elections on Sunday a source close to a key minister told CNN following a turbulent week for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that saw key government resignations and calls for an early vote.  The decision to call early elections came after crunch talks between Netanyahu and the rightwing Education Minister Naftali Bennett broke down on Friday. Bennett had threatened to quit the government if he wasn't given the defense portfolio after the resignation of former Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman on Wednesday but Netanyahu rejected Bennett's demands.  After Friday's meeting the source who is close to Bennett told CNN: "There was a need to go to elections as soon as possible with no possibility of continuing the current government. A date for the elections is expected to be decided on Sunday following a meeting of the coalition party heads." On Thursday Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Interior Minister Aryeh Deri also called for early elections. Bennett's withdrawal from the coalition would leave Netanyahu without the minimum 61 seats needed to govern making elections inevitable and ending a government that lasted nearly four years. A spokesman for Netanyahu's Likud party said in a statement after the meeting with Bennett that the Prime Minister would try to stabilize his government on Sunday at the weekly cabinet meeting. "At the beginning of the week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will hold conversations with the heads of the coalitions and he relies on the ministers' responsibility not to make a historic mistake in toppling a right-wing government" the statement said. "Prime Minister Netanyahu stressed that it's important to make every effort in order to preserve the right-wing government and not to repeat the historical mistake of 1992 when a right-wing government was toppled raised the left to power and brought the Oslo disaster upon Israel." A statement released a short time later said Netanyahu had begun those conversations Friday afternoon. Netanyahu's troubles began Wednesday when Liberman his hardline Defense Minister announced his resignation. Liberman had openly opposed a ceasefire reached with Gaza one day earlier that ended the worst 24 hours of fighting since the 2014 war advocating instead for a harsher blow against Hamas the militant group that controls the coastal enclave. Liberman called the ceasefire "a capitulation to terror." From Monday night to Tuesday afternoon Gaza militants fired some 400 rockets into Israel while the Israeli military struck more than 100 targets inside Gaza. Liberman didn't have enough seats to topple the government on his own but his withdrawal left Netanyahu with a bare minimum 61-seat coalition allowing other parties to make demands of the Israeli leader. The sudden vacancy allowed Bennett leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party to demand the defense portfolio promising to quit the government if he didn't get it. On Thursday morning Kahlon the Finance Minister met with Netanyahu and said it was time to call early elections. In a statement released after the meeting Kahlon said "The stability required at this time is not achievable in the present situation and therefore the responsible act is the establishment of a new strong and stable government." Deri the Interior Minister echoed his call increasing pressure on Netanyahu to dissolve the government.The political turbulence comes as Netanyahu faces criminal investigations that have hit him and his inner circle. Israeli police say they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of bribery fraud and breach of trust in two separate investigations. He was questioned as a suspect in a third investigation. Netanyahu has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence often employing the phrase "There will be nothing because there is nothing." The criminal investigations have barely damaged the Prime Minister's standing in the polls or his popularity. Polls have repeatedly projected that Netanyahu's Likud party would increase its number of seats if early elections are held. But the crisis may pose a new challenge for the Israeli leader since it appears he is being led to call early elections instead of calling them on his own. By law the government must choose an election date within three to five months making March or May the most likely time for elections. April is unlikely because of Jewish holidays during the month.,World
 (CNN)When the Serbian city of Kikinda unveiled its latest landmark the reaction was mixed to say the least.The 8-foot terracotta statue of an owl was intended to celebrate the city's status as a favored destination among bird-watchers who flock to view the world's largest roosting population of long-eared owls. But locals say the artwork created by local sculptor Jovan Blat looks more like a phallus than a bird. Some took to social media to express their outrage with one branding the statue a "complete failure.""This doesn't look like an owl. God save me whoever approved this has no eyes" one person wrote on the original Facebook post announcing the statue's unveiling. "People I love owls and I love the city but this sculpture is a pure failure" wrote another. While a third added: "Get this thing out of Serbia. Shame." Others stood up for the statue. "Come on people I love art and I think the statue is really nice" one Facebook user said. Blat told Serbian newspaper Vecernje Novosti that he had not intended to create an exact copy of an owl but rather a "stylized sculpture" with an "elongated tubular body." "It is clear ... that everyone does not understand contemporary art" he lamented but he admitted that he had "some technical limitations." The sculptor also said he was willing to create a new sculpture for the city in the wake of the criticism. This offer was dismissed by Zeljko Bodrozic editor of the local newspaper who said the statue had become a symbol in its own right and should remain in place. "With all the hype swirling around it ... in a way it also becomes a symbol of our city" he said. Nearly 10000 miles away Australians are drawing parallels between Blat's creation and Canberra's infamous owl statue designed by Bruce Armstrong and erected in 2011. The Australian statue also accused of penile resemblance has been a target for vandals and even gained its own Facebook pageArmstrong said in 2016 that he never intended the statue to be interpreted as anything other than an owl.,World
 (CNN)The number of US citizens seeking refuge in Canada skyrocketed last year.Exactly 2550 Americans applied for asylum in Canada in 2017 according to data from Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada. That's more than a sixfold increase from the 395 Americans who applied in 2016.It's believed that the hard-line immigration policies of President Donald Trump have fueled the increase in the number of Americans fleeing to Canada.The United States supplied the third-highest number of asylum-seekers to Canada in 2017 topped by Haiti (7785 applicants) at No. 1 and Nigeria (6005 applicants) at No. 2.There's a large number of asylum-seekers this year as well with 1215 Americans requesting refuge in Canada through the end of August.Canadian officials said that while Canada remains an open welcoming country crossing into it is not "a ticket for permanent residence.""Coming to Canada asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada" Louis Dumas a spokesman for the immigration ministry said last year.About 80% to 85% of the US asylum-seekers are of Haitian descent according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And most of this group are American-born minors crossing the border with their immigrant parents."The vast majority of US citizens claiming asylum are minor asylum claimants who were born in the United States whose parents are citizens of another country" said Peter Liang a spokesman for Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada. "In these instances the claims of persecution are made against the parents' country of origin not the United States. However given their citizenship the minor children appear as US citizens in these tables. These children predominately accompanied Haitian or Nigerian national adults."Why Haitians are leaving the USMany Haitians have headed to Canada over concerns they'll lose their temporary protected status or TPS in the United States.The Trump administration moved to end the TPS program but those plans have been temporarily blocked by a federal judge. US District Judge Edward Chen granted a preliminary injunction last month stopping the government from terminating TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti and Nicaragua.The Haitian part of TPS started shortly after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti when the Obama administration granted Haitian immigrants -- who had already been living in the United States -- temporary protected status.The program allowed them to work and shielded them from deportation. It also provided temporary refuge considering that Haiti had suffered one of the deadliest earthquakes in history and the country was seen as too unstable for people to return.The program has since been repeatedly renewed. But in 2017 Department of Homeland Security officials said conditions in Haiti were improving since the earthquake and that the program should be terminated.A wave of Haitians moved across the northern border. Many have expressed concern they'll be deported if they stay in the United States.Canada ended its version of a program that was similar to the TPS for Haitians in 2016 the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. This means Haitians without status can be deported from Canada.Many asylum-seekers have headed for Quebec where Montreal has a large Haitian community.At one point last year the asylum-seekers were being sheltered at Olympic Stadium where Montreal hosted the Summer Olympics in 1976.CNN's Madison Park and Catherine E.

Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping kicked off a packed itinerary in Papua New Guinea Friday at the start of a tour which marks Beijing's latest diplomatic foray into a region once considered outside of China's sphere of influence.Xi who will attend the 2018 APEC summit in the PNG capital Port Moresby will then continue on to Brunei and the Philippines both important claimants in the hotly contested South China Sea.Facing an increasingly hostile US government pushing back on issues of security and trade the Chinese government has been attempting to build bridges with regional powers."There's maybe a sense that China's feeling a bit on the defensive at the moment" Euan Graham senior fellow at Sydney's Lowy Institute told CNN.Xi's visit follows a strong push back against Chinese moves in the South China Sea by Washington which has stepped up naval operations warning China it views the widely-disputed territory as international waters.In the Pacific Australia announced plans to build a joint naval base with Papua New Guinea in early November as well as a new development fund implicitly challenging China's efforts to make inroads with Pacific nations."It's time to open I believe a new chapter in relations with our Pacific family ... This is not just our region or our neighborhood. This is our home" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a speech on November 8.'I love Xi Jinping'Until recently relations between China and the Philippines had grown closer under President Rodrigo Duterte who was keen for the economic benefits China could bring.In April on his way to a Chinese forum in Hainan Duterte told reporters that his country needed China adding "I love Xi Jinping." The Philippines and China have even been negotiating a joint exploration agreement in the South China Sea an agreement which if signed would implicitly recognize Beijing's widely-contested claims in the region.But six months later Graham said relations between the two countries have cooled off prompting Xi's visit in an attempt to repair ties."I think there's a realization (in Manila) that what's pledged from China is usually a fraction of what's actually delivered in the end" he said.Both China and the Philippines are claimants to islands located in the South China Sea a wide stretch of ocean through which a huge amount of the world's trade travels every day.Efforts to smooth over relations with Manila come as Beijing is pushing for a code of conduct with southeast Asian nations which would help solidify Chinese control over the important stretch of ocean.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday he hoped to see a final code of conduct within three years saying a widely-circulated draft was "an indication that China and ASEAN have reached consensus on ensuring peace and stability freedom of overflight and navigation in the South China Sea."But the United States has made it clear it won't tolerate Beijing's control of the South China Sea. Speaking beside his Chinese counterparts at the US-China Diplomatic and Security Forum in Washington on November 9 US Defense Secretary James Mattis said there would be no lessening in the number of US freedom of navigation operations."The US will continue to fly sail and operate wherever international law allows. The US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific one that is underpinned by a rules-based international order and regional stability is unwavering" he said.Billion-dollar diplomacyReports in April that Beijing had signed an agreement with Vanuatu to found a military base sparked horror inside the Australian government. If true it would leave the People's Liberation Army on Australia's doorstep.Since then Australia has dramatically upped its public profile in the Pacific Islands. On November 8 Prime Minister Morrison announced a $2 billion infrastructure initiative for Australia's Pacific neighbors."The world is changing it's true and we need to ensure that our Pacific partnerships get stronger with time that we never take them for granted that we are a reliable and steady member of the family" Morrison said during the announcement.But the Chinese government isn't giving up on its ties to the Pacific where it has made substantial diplomatic inroads through loans and aid.During his time in Papua New Guinea Xi is expected to meet with the eight leaders of Pacific Islands who have diplomatic relations with Beijing.In an opinion piece published in Papuan newspapers on Thursday Xi hailed Beijing's close relationship with the Pacific. "The Chinese often say 'Distance cannot separate true friends who remain close even when thousands of miles apart.' The vast Pacific Ocean is indeed a bond between China and Pacific island countries" the article said.Graham said despite the last minute push by Australia to make up for lost ground it was facing an uphill battle against the much wealthier China"Australia will never have the same level of influence it did 20 or 30 years ago but the best it can do is try to make up for lost time and lost ground" he said.,World

 (CNN)A team of international researchers has verified the discovery of the first meteorite impact crater ever found deep beneath the Greenland ice sheet.Found under the Hiawatha Glacier the crater is about 1000 feet (300 meters) deep and 19 miles (31 kilometers) wide according to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.It was likely formed when a half a mile (800 meter) wide iron meteorite struck northwest Greenland less than three million years ago. It was then covered in ice hiding it from view NASA said. A team of researchers from the University of Copenhagen's Centre for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark first spotted the crater in July 2015. The researchers were inspecting a new map of the topography beneath Greenland's ice sheet created by ice-penetrating radar data when they noticed a circular depression under the Hiawatha Glacier. They suspected it was a crater and have spent the last three years examining NASA data and working with colleagues in the United States to verify their findings which were published in the journal Science Advances Wednesday. "The crater is exceptionally well-preserved and that is surprising because glacier ice is an incredibly efficient erosive agent that would have quickly removed traces of the impact" said Kurt Kjær a professor at the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and lead author of the study.Kjær said the impact might have occurred at the end of the last ice age which would make it among the youngest on the planet.The research team plans to continue investigating how the meteor's impact affected the planet as a whole NASA said.,World

Known as "the Führer's (leader's) child" Rosa Bernile Nienau became very close with Hitler after they met outside his house in 1933 Alexander Historical Auctions which sold the photograph said on its website.Nienau and her mother were in a crowd of people who gathered outside Hitler's home in Bavaria Germany to celebrate his birthday. After finding out that the girl shared his birthday of April 20 Hitler was immediately captivated with her. The two were later photographed by his trusted photographer Heinrich Hoffmann Alexander Historical Auctions said.One of the photos was later inscribed by Hitler himself with the words "The dear and (considerate?) Rosa Nienau Adolf Hitler Munich the 16th June 1933" and delivered to Nienau's mother Karoline in Munich. The child had a Jewish grandmother but that didn't stop her from being the Nazi leader's favorite. "Research shows that even early on Hitler became aware of the girl's Jewish heritage but chose to ignore it either for personal or propaganda reasons" the auction house said in the description of the item. "However when Reichminister Martin Bormann discovered her lack of 'pure' German blood he forbade mother and daughter access to the Berghof." The two still maintained a close relationship as pen pals the auction house said until 1938 when Bormann permanently halted their correspondence. Seventeen of the girl's letters to Hitler and aide Wilhelm Bruckner can be found at the German Federal Archives Alexander Historical Auctions said.   Rosa Bernile died on October 5 1949 at the age of 17 in Schwabing Hospital of spinal polio according to the auction house.The photo eventually made its way to the United States and on Tuesday it was sold by the auction house based in Chesapeake City Maryland. "The photograph was consigned to us but it's really a mystery how it made it to the US" Andreas Kornfeld the auctions house's vice president of sales told CNN. "Someone owned it in Germany that's for sure."The auction house spent months investigating the authenticity of the photo Kornfeld said and they believed that the photos could have served as propaganda to paint Hitler as a kind man who loved children."Hoffmann was not just Hitler's photographer he was a great marketer who helped him along his campaign capturing him in many positive ways" Kornfeld said. This is not the first time the auction house has sold Hitler-related items. In 2017 a telephone owned by Hitler that he used to issue most of his commands during the last two years of World War II sold for $243000. Kornfeld said the photo is probably one of the most unique items the auction house has come across since autographed photographs rarely come with so much history attached."I've seen the photo many times before but I never knew about its history. I was extremely surprised" Kornfeld said. The auction house will not release the name of the buyer but Kornfeld told CNN it was an international buyer. ,World
Belfast Northern Ireland (CNN)Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Brexit have "undermined" the Good Friday peace agreement Irish premier Leo Varadkar said Saturday."Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and is fraying the relationship between Britain and Ireland" Varadkar known as the Taoiseach told Irish state broadcaster RTE."Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship" he said. The Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998 helped end years of deadly sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.The terms of the Brexit agreement on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remain one of the key sticking points in Britain's ongoing negotiations with the EU ahead of the UK's expected withdrawal from the bloc in March. Varadkar's comments came a day after politicians from both Britain and Northern Ireland hinted that a deal on the divisive border issue could be close.Arlene Foster leader of the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP said Friday after meeting with UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab that she believes the UK is "close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland."But she added "Northern Ireland must not be carved into an arrangement which undermines the constitutional or economic integrity of the United Kingdom." The DUP has a parliamentary power-sharing deal with the British Conservative Party that helps prop up Prime Minister Theresa May's government in Westminster and has consistently pushed for no hard border on the island of Ireland. In a statement released Friday Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney called the meeting with Raab "very productive" adding that the two governments are "determined to see the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly up and running again as soon as possible."Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive has not sat since January 2017 with the DUP and Sinn Fein seemingly unable to reach any agreement."We also discussed future East-West co-operation post-Brexit and agreed that we will work together to ensure that Ireland and the UK's future relationship is safeguarded" Coveney said. Following his visit to Northern Ireland Raab said that he was confident the UK could reach a Brexit deal "that works for all communities" asserting that any deal reached with the EU "must avoid a hard border"  between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic."We will not accept any Brexit proposals that threaten the economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The deal we strike with the EU must avoid a hard border and work for all parts of the community in Northern Ireland" he said.CNN's Nada Bashir reported from London and journalist Peter Taggart from Belfast.,World
New York (CNN Business)1. Bracing for Brexit: The global growth fears that have rocked the US stock market will only deepen if the United Kingdom crashes out of the European Union.The odds of a messy Brexit where Britain leaves the European Union without a transition deal have increased significantly. Such an outcome would be destabilizing and create enormous uncertainty. And it would likely plunge the UK the world's fifth-largest economy into recession.The timing would be terrible. Germany and Japan the No. 3 and 4 economies are already contracting. And China is grappling with a slowdown. All of this will act as a brake on the United States which is growing steadily but is likely to decelerate in 2019 regardless. The pitfalls of Brexit came back into sharp focus last week after UK Prime Minister Theresa May suffered the resignation of key government ministers opposing her bid to reach a divorce deal with the EU. The risk that parliament fails to agree to the Brexit terms sent the pound tumbling 2% on Thursday. UK banks fell sharply. Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) US-listed shares lost 14% last week while Barclays (BCS) shed 8%. "Rejection of the deal would increase the odds of a no-deal Brexit significantly and would be strongly negative for markets" Bill Witherell chief global economist and portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors wrote to clients. That's the last thing Wall Street needs. A bout of volatility has knocked the S&P 500 more than 7% lower since hitting a record high on September 21. Beyond signs of a global slowdown investors are concerned about the US-China trade war the impact of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes the abrupt plunge in oil prices and a looming slowdown in corporate profit growth. Those headaches have sparked an exodus from momentum stocks like Facebook (FB) Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). Another worry: the US dollar has continued to strengthen. The greenback is up about 5% this year against a basket of currencies. The strong dollar makes American goods sold overseas more expensive. And it hurts multinational companies when they convert foreign revenue. A chaotic Brexit threatens to make the dollar even stronger against not just the pound but the euro too. "The Eurozone economy is simply not in good enough shape to shrug it off" Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes wrote to clients. None of this means a messy Brexit will happen and infect the US stock market. There is still a good chance that the UK will reach a resolution that eases the economic fallout.US investors are certainly hoping so. Their worry list is already getting full. 2. Black Friday: The official kickoff to the holiday shopping season begins this week.Buoyed by low unemployment a strong economy and high consumer confidence the National Retail Federation forecasts an uptick in consumer spending. The organization says shoppers will spend 4% more this holiday season from $967 last year to $1007 this year. Last year 174 million people went shopping in-store or online between Black Friday and Cyber Monday."Retailers expect strong demand this year and are prepared with a wide array of merchandise while offering strong deals and promotions during the busiest and most competitive shopping season of the year" NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said.3. Retail earnings: More retailers are reporting earnings this week including Urban Outfitters (URBN) Best Buy (BBY) Kohl's (KSS) Gap (GPS) TJ Maxx owner TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT).L Brands which is the parent company of Victoria's Secret Bath and Body Works and Henri Bendel reports on Monday. The company is severely struggling: its stock is down 40% for the year. It previously announced it was shuttering its 123-year-old Bendel accessory unit.Another part of the company's problem is its lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret. Younger customers have deemed it uncool and switched allegiance to more inexpensive bra brands. Last week unconfirmed reports indicated that CEO Jan Singer has resigned. The announcement of Singer's departure might be shared on Monday.4. Soup shocker:   Investors will be eagerly awaiting Tuesday's earnings report amid a fierce proxy fight Campbell Soup (CPB) for control of the board. Activist investor Daniel Loeb wants to replace five members of the 12-person board. Campbell's management says it knows the company best and can put it back on the right track. The struggling 149-year-old company has faced a slew of problems including poor sales an ill-fated acquisition of Bolthouse and the abrupt departure of its CEO this year. If Campbell has a strong quarter management may use the good results to bolster its case. But if earnings disappoint Loeb will be ready to pounce. 5.

New York (CNN Business)Crude oil's sudden meltdown could be nothing to worry about. Or it could be a sign that the world economy is sick. The abrupt bear market in oil prices may have been sparked by a sharp drop-off in demand for energy which powers the economy. Investors were similarly spooked by oil's last major selloff in late 2015 and early 2016. That dive to $26 a barrel led some to fear an imminent recession. That proved to be a false alarm."There are shades of this that remind me of the latter part of 2015" Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said on Wednesday. "The question today is: Is oil again pretending to be that canary in the coal mine around slower global growth?" Corbat said while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. "Because if you look at supply-demand figures nothing at all has materially changed in the last week or two."Supply shockAnalysts are divided over how much the oil selling is being driven by simple supply worries rather than a more alarming drop in demand.It's clear that supply fears deserve at least some of the blame. Saudi Arabia and the United States are pumping record amounts of oil. US output alone is expected to spike by 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018. All of that left the oil market brimming when US sanctions on Iran had a more muted impact than expected. Rather than carrying out its threat to zero out Iranian oil shipments the Trump administration granted temporary waivers to China India and six other countries. Global growth slowdownBut demand is also playing a role. The International Energy Agency said on Wednesday that while US demand for oil has been "very robust" demand in Europe and developed Asian countries "continues to be relatively weak." The IEA also warned of a "slowdown" in demand in developing nations such as India Brazil and Argentina caused by high oil prices weak currencies and deteriorating economic activity."The outlook for the global economy has deteriorated" the IEA wrote. Indeed data published on Wednesday show that the economies of both Germany and Japan outright contracted in the third quarter. It's the first time that the Germany the economic powerhouse of Europe is shrinking since the third quarter of 2015. Last month the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 GDP estimates for both China and the United States due to the trade war. The IMF expects global growth to slow to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% this year. Demand mostly to blame?All of this helps explain why Ziad Daoud chief Middle East economist at Bloomberg Economics estimates that weaker demand was responsible for 85% of the decline in Brent crude since the October 3 high. The rest was caused by the supply shock."The lower oil price is reflective of reduced expectations for global energy demand" Daoud wrote in a report on Wednesday. But the good news is that Daoud doesn't believe the oil market knows something the rest of the world doesn't. It's simply playing catch-up."We're seeing the symptom of slower global GDP growth not a new shock to the world" he wrote. Ed Yardeni president of investment advisory Yardeni Research agrees that crude oil does not appear to be a canary in the coal mine."I'm not particularly worried" Yardeni said. "I don't think the price of oil is telling me that we have a sudden weakening in the global economy."Yardeni noted that while S&P 500 profits and corporate spending got dinged by the oil rout three years ago the economic expansion managed to continue."It was a calamity for anyone in the commodity business but not for the global economy" Yardeni said. Nicholas Colas co-founder of DataTrek Research said that he won't get overly concerned unless crude collapses much further."If it gets below $45 markets will pay much more attention" Colas said. Good news for driversThe oil selloff thus far will cut both ways for the United States because the nation is both the largest consumer and producer of oil. Recall that the 2014-2016 oil plunge sparked dozens of bankruptcies and hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the oil patch. Major energy-producing states like Texas North Dakota and Oklahoma suffered. And oil investors got hit hard. Yet American drivers will welcome cheaper prices at the pump especially right before the holiday shopping season. After creeping up on $3 a gallon the national average price of gasoline has declined 22 cents over the past month to $2.68 according to AAA. "Consumers in America are in good shape" Yardeni said "and having a plunge in the price of gasoline is a great Christmas present for them." --CNN's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report. ,Business
 (CNN)J Crew's CEO is stepping down less than two years into the job a sign of turmoil as the retailer heads into the holiday shopping stretch.In a surprise announcement Saturday the company said that Jim Brett was leaving because of a disagreement with the board of directors over how to "evolve" J Crew. Four senior executives will share CEO responsibilities.Brett took over last July from veteran chief executive Mickey Drexler who led the company for 14 years after a stint at Gap. Drexler helped position J Crew as a top clothing brand known for its quality and preppy aesthetic before a years-long sales slump. "The departure of Jim Brett is worrying for J Crew" said Neil Saunders managing director at GlobalData Retail. "It leaves the brand leaderless at a time when it needs to focus its efforts on rebuilding sales and reconnecting with customers."Brett came to J Crew from West Elm and faced the tough job of revitalizing the brand. J Crew's sales have been on the decline and it carries close to $2 billion in debt from a 2011 leveraged buyout."This company just hasn't resonated in a special way with shoppers for years" according to Sucharita Kodali a retail analyst at Forrester Research. "They missed athleisure as a trend and didn't pivot hard enough into digital or alternative brands when the consumer was buying more online from niche labels."  Pricing has been a persistent issue at the brand. J Crew maintained it could charge premium price tags even as customers drifted away Saunders said. "Today's  more democratic fashion marketplace abounds with retailers selling on-trend low-priced basics which made J Crew's position untenable."Brett oversaw a brand relaunch-- "New Crew" -- to shift J Crew off its preppy roots and connect with a broader range of shoppers.As part of the approach Brett laid out plans to make J Crew more size-inclusive striking a deal with plus-size retailer Universal Standard. J Crew expanded its assortment of lower-priced basic clothes and partnered with Amazon to sell on the website for the first time. It also launched a loyalty program last summer giving shoppers money back after a certain amount of purchases."We must reflect the America of today which is significantly more diverse than the America of 20 years ago" Brett said in an interview this year with The Wall Street Journal. "You can't be one price. You can't be one aesthetic. You can't be one fit." In August J Crew broke a four-year streak of declining sales at stores. Brett called it a "watershed moment."Three months later he is leaving the job and J Crew's future is up in the air.,Business
London (CNN Business)The global economic slowdown is happening and could spread to the United States next year. The economies of Germany and Japan shrank in the third quarter according to data published Wednesday providing a sharp contrast to another quarter of strong US growth. In China there are signs of a deepening economic malaise. The reasons for the weak performance are varied and economists believe that both Germany and Japan will dodge recessions by returning to growth soon. But the data underscore the major challenges faced by many of the world's largest economies. Germany's economy shrank for the first time since 2015 in the third quarter. It was hit by new auto emissions testing procedures that slowed car sales and a decline in exports partly due to the US-China trade war. The car certification bottleneck is expected to ease but economists say export growth could weaken further because of reduced demand from major trading partners such as Turkey Russia and China. Japan is much more accustomed to economic stagnation and even recessions but the outlook there is brighter. Its lackluster third quarter was caused by natural disasters and economists expect consumer spending to spike this quarter ahead of a planned sales tax hike next October.In China the world's second largest economy new data Wednesday revealed weaker consumption growth subdued confidence and disappointing credit growth. Economists expect the government to ramp up stimulus measures to mitigate the effects of a trade war with the United States."We believe the worse is yet to come with growth slowing faster into spring 2019" Ting Lu chief China economist at investment bank Nomura wrote in a research note.And despite the prospect of a rebound in Germany and Japan before the end of this year the global economy is also heading for a weaker 2019. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth to slow to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% this year.Risks clouding the global outlook include the trade war and the impact of US interest rate hikes on emerging markets. Italy which is locked in a standoff with the European Union over government spending could spark another crisis in Europe.'Significant slowdown' in the cards"We're not thinking it will be anything like [the financial crisis] but there might be a significant slowdown next year. It's very possible" said Andrew Kenningham chief global economist at Capital Economics. "We think the IMF is too optimistic."Some of the risk is already reflected in markets. On Tuesday fears over weaker global demand helped push US oil prices down 7% and major stocks indexes are 5% to 7% off their peaks.  One big question is which countries might serve as growth engines in 2019. India's economic growth has accelerated this year hitting 8.2% in the most recent quarter. But as one of the world's biggest energy importers it has felt the pain of higher oil prices this year. The rupee is one of the world's worst performing currencies in 2018 and that has further stoked inflation. The United States could also move into the slow lane next year as the effects of tax cuts fade."We think the United States will slow quite significantly" said Kenningham. "The fiscal stimulus is temporary and the Fed is raising interest rates.",Business
New York (CNN)The conservative public affairs firm that worked for Facebook and spread opposition research about the social media company's critics and competitors tried to get at least one journalist to do a story suggesting that the editors of Apple's news application were biased against Republicans.The firm provided little evidence to back up its claim. The Apple News app is preloaded onto all new iPhones; millions of users access news on it every day.  Apple employs editors who curate some of the stories featured on the app.Definers Public Affairs which Facebook fired on Wednesday after a New York Times report revealed the company had dug up information on Facebook's critics and competitors tried to show that staff working on Apple News had donated more money to Democratic candidates and causes than they had to Republicans.Facebook told CNN Business that this research on Apple was not done on its behalf.Definers sent the document which was titled "Apple News Curators' Political Donations" as an unsolicited pitch to a CNN employee this summer. The case the firm tried to make alleging political bias at Apple News was weak. As the dossier itself acknowledged it was not even clear that all of the political donors it had found were Apple News employees or whether they were just people who shared similar names."30 individuals have been identified as working for Apple in media curation roles or specifically at Apple News. Five of these individuals have contributed to Democratic candidates or causes" the document claimed. It also said that only one person connected to Apple News who had contributed to Republicans had been identified. The document included screenshots of the employees' LinkedIn profiles and details of their alleged donations.The evidence was not very compelling.One of the five employees Definers said were Democrats had donated $55 to Democratic candidates and causes in 2018 according to the firm.Definers claimed another employee had donated $11500 before acknowledging that it had not confirmed if the person "who made these contributions is the same individual that currently works for Apple News."Facebook also faced allegations of political bias in 2016 when it had a curated news feature edited by people rather than machines. The company scrapped the feature entirely after the controversy.In a statement provided to CNN Business on Thursday night a Facebook spokesperson said of Definers' Apple News research "This was not a project done for Facebook."Definers did not respond to CNN Business' request for comment about the Apple News dossier.On Thursday after Facebook disclosed that it had ended its relationship with the firm a spokesperson for Definers said in a statement "We are proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services. All of our work is based on publicly-available documents and information."It released another statement on Friday. In that statement it said "To be clear: Definers was not hired by Facebook as an opposition research firm. That might be the sexy story for media outlets because several of us have spent years doing research and communications for high-stakes political campaigns but that was not the scope of work we had for Facebook."In fact Definers' main services for Facebook were basic media monitoring and public relations around public policy issues facing the company. We ran a large-scale news alert service keeping hundreds of Facebook staff informed on news stories about the company and its policy challenges."Tim Miller who lists himself on his LinkedIn profile as a partner at Definers told the Times that Definers' work on Apple had been funded by a third technology company not Facebook. CNN Business has not yet confirmed the identity of that third company.A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment.,Business
 (CNN)Plant-based protein company Beyond Meat has filed for a $100 million initial public offering as vegan and meat alternative food products gain in popularity. The California-based startup is the maker of vegan sausage vegan chicken and its flagship product the Beyond Burger a 100% plant-based burger sold in grocery stores such as  Whole Foods and Kroger and served in restaurants including TGI Fridays. The company claims the burger is "the closest thing to meat" that it has ever created.In documents filed Friday the company said it had applied to list its common stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol "BYND" with an initial offering size of $100 million.The company says net revenue for the nine months ending September 29 2018 was $56.4 million a 167% increase from the same period a year earlier. Net losses through September 29 2018 were $22.4 million. "Going forward we intend to continue to invest in innovation supply chain capabilities manufacturing and marketing initiatives" the company said in the filing.The global market for meat substitutes is forecast to grow steadily from an estimated $4.6 billion in 2018 to $6.4 billion by 2023 according to research firm MarketsandMarkets.The expansion owes to rising health concerns including obesity and diabetes due to consumption of meat products the research found. Meat substitute companies like Beyond Meat Morningstar Farms and Impossible Foods are benefiting from growing concern over animal welfare and the environmental impact of factory farming. Beyond Meat was founded in 2009 and is backed by Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. J.P Morgan Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse will lead the IPO.,Business
 (CNN)The avalanche of false news that gathered speed in 2016 isn't going away -- and efforts that focus only on fixing the problem are missing the mark one expert says.Renee DiResta the head of policy at Data for Democracy and director of research at New Knowledge has studied disinformation campaigns for years. In August she participated in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign influence on social media. A clear-cut solution for misinformation might be appealing but DiResta has found that it doesn't exist."I think we have to think of this as more of a chronic condition" DiResta told CNN's Brian Stelter on this week's Reliable Sources podcast.Propaganda and disinformation have always existed but "the issue is that right now we have an information ecosystem that really facilitates the amplification of that content that facilitates it going viral" DiResta said.Listen to the whole podcast here:Foreign actors terrorists and spammers take advantage of the internet's fast-spreading pipeline for information. They buy bots to spread messages amplify manufactured narratives and post misleading memes for clicks and shares. Researchers like DiResta aim to get ahead of these forces predict what could happen next and act accordingly."As the actors misuse the platforms we're going to be responding much like an arms race" she said. But it's also the responsibility of tech companies to be transparent about when how and where they find what DiResta deems the "malign distribution" of content.The New York Times this week exposed Facebook's failure to properly deal with the early warning signs of Russian interference on the platform as leaders at the company passed off security responsibilities to others."To realize the extent to which they knew and how early they knew that was deeply disturbing" DiResta told Stelter. She believes that tech companies are improving in their efforts to combat misinformation but it's also time for the government to step up."I am not advocating for the regulation of ideas" she said. "I am advocating for oversight. I think what we saw in that article... is that self-regulation with no oversight does not work."The government has tried in part to police Big Tech. Last fall Senators Amy Klobuchar Mark Warner and John McCain introduced legislation called the Honest Ads Act that would require the same disclosures for online political ads as those on TV and the radio.Users continue to encounter extreme and false content on social sites in part because platforms like Facebook are designed to keep people engaged. Algorithms have learned that sensationalist content maintains eyeballs -- and ad dollars.The consequences of such a system are far-reaching."Democracy is predicated on an informed electorate" DiResta said. "Things like misinformation radicalization pushing people into conspiratorial groups and then profiting from that because it drives engagement that's just not a viable state for the information ecosystem to be in.",Business
San Francisco (CNN Business)In the nearly four years since Microsoft introduced its HoloLens augmented-reality headset consumers have largely forgotten about it. But now it's gaining traction among an unlikely audience: car makers.Toyota is one of a growing number of auto makers hoping augmented-reality headsets can improve everything from designing cars to manufacturing and fixing them. These headsets let users merge 3-D images with the real world. For example Ford and heavy-duty truck maker Paccar are among those using the HoloLens to help design cars and Daimler recently said it purchased over 100 HoloLens headsets to train its mechanics with 3-D models of vehicles and parts like brake systems.But the augmented-reality market is still small: Eric Abbruzzese an augmented- and virtual-reality analyst with ABI Research expects more than 2 million headsets and smart glasses will ship this year. Most of that market is made up of businesses still testing the technology. Abbruzzese predicts it will grow to 29 million by 2023.The most recent example of car makers adopting the technology is Toyota. At its headquarters in Japan's Aichi prefecture employees like Koichi Kayano are experimenting with HoloLens for a variety of tasks. Kayano a project manager who finds ways to use 3-D models across the company is using the headset to speed up the process of measuring the thickness of a vehicle's paint and rust-prevention coatings to ensure consistent color and avoid corrosion.Typically this process takes two people an entire day but the HoloLens cuts it down to four hours -- and only requires one person to do it. Workers traditionally carefully place specially-made paper patterns which have about 500 holes cut throughout on the exterior of a car. An employee then scans the visible paint with a measuring instrument. Now Kayano and his team developed an app that lets them skip the paper pattern and use the HoloLens to project a digital array of dots onto a real car revealing which areas need to be tested."It's as quick as wearing a HoloLens and seeing the measurement points virtually on the vehicle" Kayano told CNN Business through an interpreter during a phone interview. "Preparation time is like instant."Toyota is also using the headset to visualize new machines on the factory floor at scale and in 3-D and determine where they will fit. It's also conducting a similar experiment to figure out whether large vehicles can fit inside a building.But HoloLens still faces adoption challenges. To start HoloLens is a pricey investment -- it costs $3000 or $5000 per headset depending on whether you want a developer or enterprise version. The hardware also hasn't been updated since it was released two and a half years ago and at 1.3 pounds it remains heavy especially when worn for hours at a time. Meanwhile the battery only lasts between two and three hours of continuous use.HoloLens is far from the only wearable AR device on the market. It competes with Magic Leap's recently released Magic Leap One headset and AR glasses from companies such as ODG Vuzix and Epson. Still HoloLens has become the "gold standard" of high-end AR products due to features like showing the user 3-D images that can stick to one spot in the real world and letting a remote person see what's in the user's real-world field of view said Abbruzzese.However companies have been somewhat slow to buy and use AR technology due to concerns about cost as well as if it's worth it to provide the resources to train workers. But Abbruzzese said Toyota's use of the HoloLens to measure paint thickness is a clear example of possible savings."Toyota can then make a very informed decision about how well this can scale and [determine] the return on investment" he said.Toyota declined to share how many headsets the company has bought so far. But Microsoft did confirm the car companies are purchasing them -- either from Microsoft itself or from a supplier.Although Toyota's HoloLens project is only a test so far the company said it's also helping with the development of a vehicle coming to the market in the near future. ,Business
London (CNN Business)Volkswagen has committed to spending tens of billions of dollars as part of a dramatic shift to electric and autonomous vehicles. The Germany carmaker said Friday that it would invest €44 billion ($50 billion) by 2023 to develop electric cars self-driving vehicles and other new technology. Speaking at a press conference following a meeting of the company's supervisory board CEO Herbert Diess described the company's strategy as an "electric offensive."Diess acknowledged that increased spending on new technology could initially harm earnings growth. The investment is roughly €10 billion ($11.4 billion) above what the company set aside for new tech in last year's budget plan."Volkswagen must become more efficient more productive and more profitable in order to finance the high expenditure in the future and in order to stay competitive" Diess said during the press conference.Volkswagen's stock which declined roughly 12% so far this year dropped another 1.3% on Friday. Volkswagen and FordDiess said that talks with US automaker Ford (F) about working together were "progressing positively."So far the only alliance firmly in place between Ford and Volkswagen involves an agreement to work together on commercial vehicles. But Diess sees potential in more cooperation."We can solve the transformation of our business more easily with partnerships" he said Friday.Automakers are spending billions of dollars as they try to develop the electric and self-driving vehicles they believe are the future. They're also facing more competition from tech companies including Uber and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG). Upstarts like Tesla (TSLA) have proved formidable too.Production changesVolkswagen said that the first model built under its new strategy the ID will begin rolling off the assembly lines in 2022. Diess said the car will have a range of up to 550 km (340 miles) and cost the equivalent of its current diesel Golf. The car group which owns the Porsche and Audi brands said it would attempt to increase the productivity of its plants 30% by 2025. It plans to build vehicles from different brands on the same production lines as part of the effort.It will also relocate production of the Passat from Germany to the Czech Republic. Diess said that Volkswagen (VLKAF) was considering whether to build its own battery cells a key component in electric vehicles. China shiftThe carmaker also announced leadership changes in China the world's largest car market. Diess now has direct responsibility for the China business a move that Volkswagen said reflects "the growing importance of the Chinese market and the high pace of technological development in China."Stephan Wöllenstein who currently oversees the passenger car division in China will handle business operations in the country going forward.,Business
 (CNN)CNN won round one of its federal lawsuit against President Trump. But it was only round one. And no one knows how many more rounds there will be. "We want to just simply move forward and let CNN and Jim Acosta gather news and report it" CNN lawyer Ted Boutrous said in an interview on Friday.He said the law is "very clear in terms of how these things should proceed and what the White House can and can't do."Boutrous said CNN would welcome a settlement of the lawsuit now that Judge Timothy J. Kelly has sided with CNN and forced the government to return Acosta's press pass for the time being.In these situations Boutrous said "you look for a resolution that makes the most sense so everyone can get out of court and get back to their work. And that goes for the White House and for the journalists. So we're open to anything."But Boutrous also said that the network is prepared for a long-term legal fight if need be. "We're ready to litigate as long as we have to to protect these First Amendment rights to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward" he said.The government has not formally said what its next step will be. But Trump downplayed the impact of the loss in court telling Fox's Chris Wallace in an interview later in the day that "it's not a big deal." CNN and Acosta filed the suit on Tuesday alleging violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. The six defendants include Trump chief of staff John Kelly and press secretary Sarah Sanders.Trump and Sanders both spoke on Friday about setting up rules and regulations about how White House reporters act potentially as a precursor for removing reporters' press passes in the future.  The Justice Department did not mention that but a spokeswoman said Friday night "We are disappointed with the district court's decision. The President has broad authority to regulate access to the White House including to ensure fair and orderly White House events and press conferences. We look forward to continuing to defend the White House's lawful actions."Kelly heard oral arguments on Wednesday afternoon and reconvened court on Friday morning.He granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order on Fifth Amendment grounds citing violations of due process. And he said he believes that CNN and Acosta are likely to prevail in the case overall. He emphasized the "very limited" nature of the ruling and did not make a judgment on the First Amendment claims in the lawsuit.Boutrous said the result was a "very good day for our Constitution as a general matter and for my clients in particular."Boutrous and another veteran litigator Ted Olson both of the firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher were retained by CNN in preparation for the lawsuit.In an interview for Sunday's "Reliable Sources" Boutrous said he was "very happy to get the call" because he was following the Acosta dust-up and saying "this is wrong this is outrageous."He felt that this case was about much more than Acosta and CNN: "This was the threat to press credentials for all the reporters."As for Friday's finding in CNN's favor Boutrous said it showed the American system of checks and balances in action."We had cases both on the First and Fifth amendment issues but also on the other questions that the court had to address: Was there irreparable harm? Does the balance of fairness favor Jim Acosta or the government and what's in the public interest? And the court in a very clear straightforward way walked through those legal principles and applied them. That's what we want our courts to do" Boutrous said. "That's part of our separation of powers process where the courts are there to review what the other branches of government do. So the system worked exactly the way it's supposed to work.""And you know we're not done" he added. "And we know that." But for now Acosta is back at work. He reported live from his usual position on the North Lawn of the White House on CNN's "The Situation Room" Friday evening.  Lawyers for both sides are expected to be back in court next week to discuss the timeline for further proceedings. The next phase he said is to obtain a preliminary injunction which would last longer than a temporary restraining order. "So unless we come to some agreement or we agree to extend that we go back into court and argue for a preliminary injunction which can be indefinite much longer" Boutrous said.,Business
 (CNN)CNN's Jim Acosta has returned to his post at the White House following a court ruling that forced the Trump administration to reinstate his press pass.Now President Trump is vowing to create "rules and regulations" for how White House reporters act. He says "you have to practice decorum" at the White House."It's not a big deal" Trump told Fox News in an interview on Friday. "What they said though is that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct etcetera. We're going to write them up. It's not a big deal. If he misbehaves we'll throw him out or we'll stop the news conference."Friday's ruling by federal judge Timothy J. Kelly was an initial victory for CNN in its lawsuit against Trump and several top aides. The suit alleges that CNN and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights were violated by last week's suspension of his press pass.Kelly did not rule on the underlying case on Friday. But he granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order on Fifth Amendment grounds. And he said he believes that CNN and Acosta are likely to prevail in the case overall."Let's go back to work" Acosta said in brief comments outside the courthouse.Later in the day he arrived at the White House and received his Secret Service "hard pass" the pass that was taken from him nine days ago.He is expected to appear on CNN for one of his usual live shots on Friday evening.CNN v. Trump is an important test of press freedom in the US. Kelly seemingly well aware of the high stakes read his written opinion from the bench for nearly 20 minutes Friday morning. He sided with CNN on the basis of the suit's Fifth Amendment claims saying the White House did not provide Acosta with the due process required to legally revoke his press pass.He left open the possibility that the White House could seek to revoke Acosta's pass again if it provided due process. That may be why Trump is talking about implementing "rules."Kelly went to great lengths to explain what his decision meant — and what it didn't mean — to the attentive audience. He emphasized the "very limited" nature of the ruling. He said that while he may not agree with the underlying case law that CNN's argument was based on he had to follow it. "I've read the case closely" he said. "Whether it's what I agree with that's a different story. But I must apply precedent as I see it."Kelly criticized last week's blacklisting of Acosta as "shrouded in mystery" noting that the Justice Department lawyer in the case couldn't even say who ordered the decision.But he also said that he was not making a judgment on the First Amendment claims that CNN and Acosta have made.Despite that Sanders said in her statement "Today the court made clear that there is no absolute First Amendment right to access the White House."The judge did not make that clear. But he did note that Sanders' initial claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched a White House intern was "likely untrue" and "partly based on evidence of questionable accuracy." Acosta held onto a microphone when an intern tried to take it away during a presidential news conference last week. Later that day the correspondent's access to the White House was suspended.Kelly noted that Trump may never call on Acosta again. But that's not relevant to this decision he said. There needs to be due process regarding the pass.Kelly was appointed to the bench by Trump last year and confirmed with bipartisan support in the Senate. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling "strikes me as an extremely savvy and wise resolution of this case."Press Secretary Sarah Sanders one of the six defendants in the case did not specify whether the administration would continue to fight the lawsuit in court. The legal battle may continue for months.But Sanders said in a statement that "we will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future. There must be decorum at the White House."Trump said the same thing during a Q&A with reporters in the Oval Office."People have to behave" he said when asked about the administration's defeat in court."If they" meaning reporters like Acosta "don't listen to the rules and regulations we'll end up back in court and we'll win. But more importantly we'll just leave" meaning stop taking questions from the press. "And then you won't be very happy. Because we do get good ratings."Ted Boutrous one of the outside lawyers representing CNN in the case said in an interview that the network is open to a resolution that could avoid further legal action."We want to just simply move forward and let CNN and Jim Acosta gather news and report it" Boutrous said.But what if the administration tries to implement intense restrictions on the press corps or tries to revoke other press passes?"I think you know we're ready to litigate as long as we have to to protect these First Amendment rights to ask the court to declare rules of the road going forward" Boutrous said.In a statement about the ruling CNN said "We are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days. Our sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN but a free strong and independent American press."Numerous press freedom advocacy groups also cheered the ruling. "Today a major precedent was set for the future of a free press. It is a win for one reporter but most importantly a win for the Constitution and the enduring freedoms it grants us all" the Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection said.And the ACLU said "the White House surely hoped that expelling a reporter would deter forceful questioning but the court's ruling will have the opposite effect."Most of the country's major news organizations have supported CNN's lawsuit recognizing that the White House may try to ban other reporters in the future.CNN has asked the court for "permanent relief" meaning a declaration from the judge that Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass was unconstitutional. This legal conclusion could protect other reporters from retaliation by the administration.But the judge will rule on all of that later. Further hearings are likely to take place in the next few weeks according to CNN's lawyers.The White House took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access after he had a combative exchange with Trump at last week's post-midterms press conference. CNN privately sought a resolution for several days before filing suit on Tuesday.The defendants include Trump Sanders and chief of staff John Kelly.Judge Kelly heard oral arguments from both sides on Wednesday afternoon. Kelly asked tough questions of both sides drilling particularly deep into some of CNN's arguments.Then he said he would issue a ruling Thursday afternoon. He later postponed it until Friday morning leaving both sides wondering about the reason for the delay.In public the White House continued to argue that Acosta deserves to be blacklisted because he was too aggressive at the press conference.Speaking with Robert Costa at a Washington Post Live event on Thursday White House communications official Mercedes Schlapp said press conferences have a "certain decorum" and suggested that Acosta violated that. "In that particular incident we weren't going to tolerate the bad behavior of this one reporter" she said. Schlapp repeated the "bad behavior" claim several times.When Costa asked if the White House is considering yanking other press passes. Schlapp said "I'm not going to get into any internal deliberations that are happening."In court on Wednesday Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that the Trump White House has the legal right to kick out any reporter at any time for any reason — a position that is a dramatic break from decades of tradition.While responding to a hypothetical from Kelly Burnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's press pass if it didn't agree with their reporting. "As a matter of law... yes" he said.The White House Correspondents' Association — which represents reporters from scores of different outlets — said the government's stance is "wrong" and "dangerous."         "Simply stated" the association's lawyers wrote in a brief on Thursday "if the President were to have the absolute discretion to strip a correspondent of a hard pass the chilling effect would be severe and the First Amendment protections afforded journalists to gather and report news on the activities on the President would be largely eviscerated."On Friday the correspondents' association welcomed Kelly's ruling and said "we thank all of the news outlets and individual reporters who stood up in recent days for the vital role a free and independent news media plays in our republic.",Business
New York (CNN Business)Goldman Sachs has a 1MDB problem.At least investors and legal experts think so. The bank's shares earlier this week had their worst day since November 2011 falling more than 7% Monday and failing to recover since. The reason according to analyst Brian Kleinhanzl at KBW: Goldman's ongoing exposure to the scandal surrounding Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The US Justice Department claims conspirators misappropriated $4.5 billion from the 1MDB fund and the government has scrutinized Goldman's role in the scheme. Almost half of the money that Goldman Sachs (GS) helped 1MDB raise through bond offerings was allegedly siphoned off to pay for jewelry and fine art and to fund bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials.The bank which has reportedly been meeting with Justice Department officials maintains that rogue employees misled its legal and compliance teams about the deals. Two former Goldman Sachs bankers who managed the 1MDB relationship have been charged for their involvement in the conspiracy.But the "bad eggs" approach might not be enough to keep the bank out of legal trouble.Goldman could face large fines or have to forfeit the money it made on the bond deals. The bank could even be indicted. In theory its banking charter could be revoked — though the government almost certainly won't go that far said Stefan Cassella a former US prosecutor who specializes in asset forfeiture and money laundering."Usually what happens is the middle ground between doing nothing and a criminal indictment" he said.How Goldman got caught up in the 1MDB sagaIn 2012 and 2013 Goldman Sachs arranged three large bond offerings for the 1MDB fund. The bond sales which raised a total of $6.5 billion earned Goldman Sachs about $600 million in fees according to court documents.But more than $2.7 billion of the proceeds from those offerings was stolen from 1MDB according to the Justice Department. That raises questions about who at the firm knew about the questionable integrity of the deals and when they knew it.At the center of the saga is Tim Leissner Goldman's former chairman of Southeast Asia. Earlier this month the Justice Department announced that he had pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act through the payment of bribes to government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. The government also filed charges against another ex-Goldman banker Roger Ng and Jho Low the Malaysian financier who US officials say was behind much of the embezzlement plot. Ng was arrested in Malaysia and Low remains at large. CNN has been unable to reach Ng for comment. A spokesperson for Low said that Low maintains his innocence and "simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case."Charging documents paint a stark picture of Leissner the lead banker at Goldman in charge of the 1MDB relationship and Ng a managing director at the firm.Leissner and Ng who started to work with Low in 2009 are said to have repeatedly concealed Low's involvement in deals with 1MDB and its predecessor Terengganu Investment Authority from the bank's legal and compliance teams so that deals with the entities would be approved.They allegedly supported at least three attempts between 2009 and 2011 to make Low a formal client of Goldman Sachs believing he would help land the firm lucrative deals. Each time people in Goldman's compliance department raised concerns since the source of Low's wealth was murky at best.Still Leissner and Ng allegedly worked with Low to secure 1MDB business for Goldman. The bank was selected to underwrite the three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013. Leissner and Ng allegedly scored the deals with Low by facilitating millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks according to court documents. They allegedly hid from the bank's legal team the fact that Low was involved and kept some of the stolen money for themselves.Leissner left Goldman Sachs in 2016 after it was discovered that he wrote an unsanctioned letter of recommendation for Low. Ng left in 2014.What's next for the bankGoldman's corporate liability depends on whether the Justice Department believes the firm had adequate legal and compliance controls in place to catch this type of behavior and whether Goldman executives were in fact duped or if they had some knowledge of impropriety legal experts say.Leissner in his guilty plea from August unsealed earlier this month said it was "very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees."Government prosecutors made similar claims in their charging documents. The business culture at Goldman "was highly focused on consummating deals at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper orientation of its compliance functions" especially in Southeast Asia according to the indictment of Low and Ng.Language in these documents leaves open the possibility that the Justice Department could indict Goldman Sachs said Cassella."The government took pains to allege that the individual defendants who were Goldman employees were acting within the scope of their employment and for the purpose of benefiting the corporation" he said.Such a move would be rare however — especially since Goldman is working with authorities supplying documents and other material. This could mitigate penalties Cassella added.Still the firm appears to be preparing for a hefty fine. Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing earlier this month that investigations by the Justice Department and other authorities "could result in the imposition of significant fines penalties and other sanctions against the firm."In 2014 the Justice Department charged JPMorgan Chase (JPM) under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which requires financial companies to help the federal government detect money laundering for its ties to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Prosecutors said the bank failed to appropriately flag suspicious activity from Madoff's accounts and required JPMorgan to pay $1.7 billion to victims of his fraud.A spokesperson for Goldman said the firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating the matter.,Business
New York (CNN Business)An ex-Goldman Sachs banker who pleaded guilty to conspiring to steal money from Malaysia's state investment fund said Goldman's "culture" encouraged executives to work around the legal team to score business. It was "very much in line of its culture of Goldman Sachs to conceal facts from certain compliance and legal employees" said Tim Leissner Goldman's former Southeast Asia chairman in his guilty plea from August which was unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn Friday. Leissner admitted that he hid from Goldman the fact that Malaysian financier Jho Low secured business for the bank by bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. The US government alleges Low played a central role in a scheme to launder billions of dollars from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad.Last week the US Justice Department announced charges against Leissner Low and Roger Ng another former Goldman banker. The agency said that Leissner would forfeit $43.7 million. Goldman Sachs (GS) continues to face scrutiny for its role in the scandal. The bank in 2012 and 2013 arranged three bond offerings for the 1MDB fund that raised about $6.5 billion according to the court documents. The bank made about $600 million for its work the Justice Department said.More than $2.7 billion from those offerings was siphoned off with the knowledge of Leissner and Ng to bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi according to the indictments. Leissner and Ng are said to have worked around internal legal and compliance controls at Goldman Sachs to make sure the deals would go through. The business culture at Goldman "was highly focused on consummating deals at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper orientation of its compliance functions" especially in Southeast Asia government prosecutors said in their indictment of Low and Ng unsealed last week.The legal team at Goldman had raised concerns about Low in the past the indictment said.A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said the firm continues to cooperate with all authorities investigating the matter. Ng was arrested last week in Malaysia according to the Justice Department and has not yet entered a plea. He could not be reached for comment. Low who maintains his innocence remains at large. A spokesperson for his legal team said Low held no formal position at 1MDB and was neither employed by Goldman Sachs nor the governments of Malaysia or Abu Dhabi. It's unclear if anyone else at the bank beyond Leissner and Ng knew about Low's involvement in the bond deals.The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein who stepped down from his role atop the bank in October attended two meetings with Malaysia's former prime minister in 2009 and 2013 that included discussions of 1MDB. Low was present at both meetings according to the Journal.A source familiar with the matter said that Blankfein had no recollection of meeting Low and it's unclear if Low was present at the two meetings.Another Goldman banker Andrea Vella was placed on leave last week pending a review of alleged conduct related to the 1MDB case. Vella had been demoted from his position as co-head of investment banking in Asia last month.The Justice Department alleges a total of $4.5 billion was stolen from the 1MDB fund by high-level officials. US officials claim that laundered funds were pumped into New York condos hotels yachts and a jet and used to fund Hollywood films such as "The Wolf of Wall Street.",Business

 (CNN)Plant-based protein company Beyond Meat has filed for a $100 million initial public offering as vegan and meat alternative food products gain in popularity. The California-based startup is the maker of vegan sausage vegan chicken and its flagship product the Beyond Burger a 100% plant-based burger sold in grocery stores such as  Whole Foods and Kroger and served in restaurants including TGI Fridays. The company claims the burger is "the closest thing to meat" that it has ever created.In documents filed Friday the company said it had applied to list its common stock on the Nasdaq under the symbol "BYND" with an initial offering size of $100 million.The company says net revenue for the nine months ending September 29 2018 was $56.4 million a 167% increase from the same period a year earlier. Net losses through September 29 2018 were $22.4 million. "Going forward we intend to continue to invest in innovation supply chain capabilities manufacturing and marketing initiatives" the company said in the filing.The global market for meat substitutes is forecast to grow steadily from an estimated $4.6 billion in 2018 to $6.4 billion by 2023 according to research firm MarketsandMarkets.The expansion owes to rising health concerns including obesity and diabetes due to consumption of meat products the research found. Meat substitute companies like Beyond Meat Morningstar Farms and Impossible Foods are benefiting from growing concern over animal welfare and the environmental impact of factory farming. Beyond Meat was founded in 2009 and is backed by Bill Gates and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. J.P Morgan Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse will lead the IPO.,Business
New York  (CNN Business)Coca-Cola wants to be a "total beverage company." It's hoping a new energy drink will help it get there.The company recently said it is considering adding a new drink Coca-Cola Energy to its roster of Coke products. The drink would use guarana extract and other naturally-derived ingredients for more caffeine and would also come in a sugar-free variety. Monster Coca-Cola's energy drink partner isn't thrilled with the plan. Coca-Cola has filed for arbitration with Monster to see whether the new product would breach the agreement they entered when Coca-Cola took a stake in Monster and the two swapped products. Both companies have said that they value the relationship. But Coca-Cola (KO) CEO James Quincey is pushing for aggressive growth and he's not afraid to ruffle some feathers. "Coke wants to play everywhere it can" said Duane Stanford executive editor of Beverage Digest. "When you do that sometimes you will bump against contractual barriers."Now Coca-Cola appears to be turning its attention to energy — with good reason. The energy sector is one of the fastest-growing segments of the beverage industry said Laurent Grandet a consumer analyst with Guggenheim Securities. And it's highly profitable because consumers are used to paying more for energy drinks than soft drinks he noted. Plus some people already drink Coke for a caffeine jolt. "It's a natural brand extension" he said. Coke recognized the importance of energy drinks when it struck a deal with Monster in 2014. Once the deal closed Coca-Cola transferred to Monster its energy brands like Full Throttle Burn and Mother. It also took over Monster's non-energy beverage brands including Hansen's Natural Sodas and Hubert's Lemonade. Coca-Cola also became Monster's preferred distribution partner globally. Coca-Cola now owns nearly 18.5% of the company.But since then the energy drink sector has evolved. "Pretty much every beverage category is experimenting with making full use of energy components" Stanford said. We're "seeing lines blur."Recently consumers have been looking for functional ingredients — like caffeine for energy or turmeric for health — in everything from sparkling water to juice. That means that energy drinks compete with other types of beverages and that people who may not seek out an energy drink may still be looking for an energy boost. By using natural ingredients and leveraging its recognizable brand Coke may be going after consumers who wouldn't reach for a Red Bull or Monster drink. In that way the new drink could serve as complement rather than competitor to Monster. Coca-Cola has said it "will abide by our contractual obligations" to Monster once the issue has been resolved and a Monster executive told analysts last week that the relationship between Coke and Monster is "good" adding that he "doesn't see any changes" stemming from the disagreement. With more energy drinks Coca-Cola is starting to fill out its total beverage mandate. Earlier this year Coca-Cola focused on coffee and sports drinks. The company announced in August that it agreed to buy UK coffee chain Costa Coffee for $5.1 billion part of what Quincey called a "coffee strategy." Quincey said that the acquisition is about gaining access to Costa's many products like its coffee vending machines on-the-go outlets ready-to-drink iced coffee and beans from its roastery.A few weeks before Coca-Cola announced plans to take a big stake in sports drink maker BodyArmor to become the company's second-largest shareholder. The move helps Coca-Cola compete against PepsiCo's Gatorade which has performed extremely well. Coca-Cola has also been investing in its flagship brand.Early this year the company unveiled a new look and new flavors of Diet Coke that were painstakingly designed to lure in Millennials. Coca-Cola spent two years on the relaunch and says it asked more than 10000 people for their thoughts. Stanford sees interest in an energy line as a sign that Coca-Cola thinks Coke still has room to grow. "Coca-Cola is once again looking for ways to experiment with its flagship brand" he noted. Coca-Cola is still avoiding entering some markets. Quincey said last month that the company "doesn't have any plans at this stage" to enter the CBD market. CBD is a non-psychoactive component of marijuana.,Business
New York  (CNN Business)Burger King wants to move into the future but it's still stuck in the past. The fast food chain's parent company Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said last month that it plans to modernize Burger King's locations across the country in a plan it calls "Burger King of Tomorrow." Despite the project's name Burger King's efforts are nothing new. The updated restaurants will feature self-order kiosks and sleeker restaurants — changes Burger King's competitors started making years ago. While its competitors were upgrading their stores Burger King focused on marketing campaigns and menu items. Burger King's new restaurants will feature open kitchens double drive-thru lanes and outdoor digital menu boards. The burger chain hopes the changes will convince American consumers to order Burger King meals more often and spend more money at the store. The plan is a move in the right direction said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. It's important for Burger King to focus on increasing convenience. But the brand is "playing catch-up here" he said.   Gimmicks and ads Until its modernization plan Burger King had been pushing gimmicky products including a Halloween burger that gives you nightmares. It also weighed in on political topics with stunts like a "chick tax" on chicken fries in pink packaging designed to call attention to the so-called pink tax on women's products and a Whopper "fast lane" that sought to explain net neutrality. "They've really focused a lot on marketing product development and menu innovation" said Neil Saunders managing director at GlobalData Retail.. "They're very good at coming up with the one-off menu innovations" he added. "That drives traffic." But it hasn't been enough. In the first quarter of this year Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International (QSR) reported that it was pleased with the burger chain's momentum. "Our BK comparable sales results this quarter were driven by notable strength in the U.S." Restaurant Brand's CEO Daniel Schwartz said at the time. Since then momentum has slowed. In the second quarter the company said US comparable sales increased by 1.8% and in the third quarter that figure slipped 0.7%. Same-store US sales rose by 2.4% in the third quarter at McDonald's. At Wendy's sales for that period also slipped by 0.2%. Those competitors put their upgrade plans in motion long ago.  Strong competition  Over the summer McDonald's (MCD) announced a $6 billion investment toward modernizing most of its US restaurants by 2020. The McDonald's redesign also includes digital menu boards and self-order kiosks. It's important for quick-service restaurants to update their stores to maximize convenience Hottovy said. But it can take years for chains to get all of their franchises on the same page. McDonald's is in a unique position said Oches because franchisers trust the company to deliver results. "New store prototypes remodels ... those things are expensive" Oches said. It's easier for a brand like McDonald's to convince franchises to spend that money. For others it's more of a struggle. Wendy's has spent the better part of a decade upgrading its stores to include lounge seating digital menu boards and Wi-Fi. The company said this month that it's remodeled nearly half of its stores. Wendy's is also thinking about other improvements to stores: Last year the company announced a new series of smart design restaurants that use less energy than its traditional stores.Burger King may have also struggled because unlike Wendy's (WEN) and McDonald's it's part of a holding company. Burger King and Tim Hortons merged in 2014 to form Restaurant Brands which snapped up Popeye's last year. "When you become this enormous multi-brand holding company ... [it's] hard to focus on details" said Sam Oches editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine.  Catching up To regain its footing Burger King needs to increase traffic to stores and boost how much customers spend on regular orders. "Regular trade is the bread and butter" said Saunders. "The marketing and the seasonal occasions are much less important." Burger King is still in the early stages of the project Schwartz noted in October adding that there are already pilot restaurants operating in Miami."To refresh a store that takes a long time" said Oches. "So the fact that we're still at the very early stages of this tells me that they have a long road." ,Business
New York  (CNN Business)Starbucks wants to be big in China and even bigger in the United States. To do that the coffee company is making some changes. After years of aggressive growth the coffee company has locations all over the world. But now CEO Kevin Johnson wants to focus on growing in the two coffee-loving countries where it thinks its efforts will pay off the most. To drive that growth Starbucks freed up cash and resources by closing its Teavana retail stores partnering with Nestle to create a "global coffee alliance" and reorganizing its corporate team."I tend to bring a much more disciplined approach to picking the priorities" Johnson said during the Oppenheimer Consumer Conference in June. "If you pick the right priorities and you put the resources and energy behind them you move the needle." Since taking over from Howard Schultz in April of last year Johnson has outlined a plan to trim fat and bolster the company in its two largest markets. So far it's working. Starbucks (SBUX) beat Wall Street's expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings. Revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter that ended in September up 11% from the same time last year. In the three months ending in September comparable store sales grew by 4% in the United States and 1% in China. The good results sent shares of the company soaring. Recently Starbucks announced that it is handing over the ownership and management of its stores in the Netherlands France Belgium and Luxembourg to its partner Alsea which operates restaurants in Latin America. The decision to step back from those markets in Western Europe may have been driven by how competitive the market is there said Robert Salomon a professor of international management at NYU's Stern business school. "It's very difficult for them to enter with a proposition to say 'Hey we're the espresso coffee company'" he noted. But in China Starbucks can set itself up as a coffee destination.  Starbucks opened its first store in China in 1999. "They are certainly ahead of the curve" he said. But Starbucks has only recently decided to lean into the Chinese market. That may be because now Chinese customers may be more amenable to what Starbucks has to offer Saloman said. Today consumers in China have an "increasing affinity for Western goods especially more luxury goods" said Saloman. "Starbucks has that high-end appeal so they're capitalizing on that trend."To build up its presence in China Starbucks is opening stores at a rapid pace. The company said in May that it plans to nearly double its number of coffee shops to 6000 before the end of 2022. And it's making sure that people who don't come into stores have easy access to Starbucks coffee: Over the past few months Starbucks has been steadily building up its delivery capabilities in the country. Johnson said during the Oppenheimer conference that he plans to introduce Starbucks coffee to a whole new generation of coffee drinkers in China. The efforts are paying off. "Results in China are extraordinary" noted Nick Setyan a restaurant analyst with Wedbush.But China isn't a sure bet Saloman said. If political ties worsen or if China's economy takes a hit and people have less disposable income customers may take their business elsewhere. "China presents a tremendous amount of risk but also a lot of upside potential" Saloman said. Expanding in the United States on the other hand is a lot less risky in part because Starbucks already knows what US consumers like. In the United States Starbucks is growing at a slower pace than it has in the past. But it's still going after new markets."All of the space in middle America in the Midwest and down through the South is wide open" Johnson said during the conference. "A large proportion of our new store growth are going in the areas where we are under-penetrated." And it's opening more drive-thrus which tend to perform better than regular Starbucks cafes. Starbucks has also been tweaking its menu to entice more health-conscious customers with lower-sugar Frappuccinos and more non-blended alternatives like cold brew and iced teas. The company has also focused on connecting with more customers through its digital platforms. More than 15 million people are now active US members in its loyalty program. Starbucks says that those members offer helpful feedback on what they want — like really Christmasy holiday cups. ,Business
New York (CNN Business)New Age Beverages recently announced it intends to launch a line of CBD-infused waters teas and other drinks in the United States. The company already makes Bob Marley-branded organic coffees and teas and Coco Libre coconut water and kombucha drinks. Investors couldn't be more pleased with the expansion plan: New Age's stock which has been extremely volatile this year is up nearly 125% in 2018.  CEO Brent Willis told CNN Business the company is already in conversations with many retailers about selling its potential line of CBD drinks.But the plan depends on Congress passing the Farm Bill which would make it legal to produce hemp and potentially open the door for more products containing cannabidiol or CBD. Now that Democrats will control the House excitement for its passage is growing. Cannabis stocks rallied sharply Wednesday on that development as well as the news that Michigan residents voted to legalize recreational marijuana. It didn't hurt  that Jeff Sessions who has vocally opposed federal legalization of pot was fired as attorney general by President Donald Trump the same day.New Age Beverages (NBEV) got a huge lift along with the cannabis stock rally soaring more than 20% on Wednesday. Shares were down 4% in midday Thursday trade. CEO Willis a beverage industry veteran who has also worked for Coca-Cola (KO) and Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is optimistic the Farm Bill will pass soon. He said New Age's move into CBD-based drinks is about health and wellness not getting people stoned."We want to focus purely on healthy drinks" Wills said. While CBD is also a component of marijuana it does not have the psychoactive properties that cause users to get high. Willis said that there are physical benefits to CBD-drinks too particularly for pain management. "The big question is where do you put these beverages on the shelves?" Willis said.More CBD drinks coming to America soon?Maybe a better question for Willis: Who's the competition?Coke was rumored to be interested in making an investment in Canadian cannabis firm Aurora (ACB) but CEO James Quincey recently shot down that talk.Pepsi (PEP) has said it's looked at the CBD space. Corona owner Constellation Brands (STZ) has a more than $4 billion stake in cannabis company Canopy Growth (CGC). Meanwhile Molson Coors (TAP) has a joint venture to develop cannabis beverages in Canada. And Lagunitas a beer brand owned by Heineken (HEINY) is selling a cannabis-infused sparkling water brand in California. Big beverage makers may want a piece of the CBD actionThis trend is likely to continue with other experts wondering if companies like Starbucks (SBUX) may want to eventually get in on the CBD action."All beverage companies including coffee and soda makers ... will inevitably embrace CBD-infused drinks" Paul Rosen CEO of Tidal Royalty a financing firm for licensed cannabis companies told CNN Business in an interview. Willis noted that "smoking marijuana may diminish in popularity and more conventionally consumed CBD products may become more popular."So does that mean New Age Beverages could be a takeover target? Willis was coy. He acknowledged that the beverage industry is somewhat insular and that he knows most of the leading players from his time at Coke and A-B InBev. "It's a close-knit community and we are a perfect fit for other beverage companies" Willis said before quickly adding that he wasn't actively shopping New Age Beverages."We want to be a billion-dollar business. It may take a few years to get there but we don't see any major obstacles" he said confidently. "Competition and regulation can't stop us.",Business
 (CNN Business)When Adina Kamkhatchi was in college she had an eye for jewelry but not much of a budget."I couldn't buy expensive jewelry and I also couldn't find cheaper good quality jewelry that would last" she says. So she decided she'd try her hand at making her own.At the time she was a freshman at Brooklyn College and she only had classes two days a week. "I wanted to do something more. I consulted my mom told her about it and she loved it" says Adina now 22.With about $1000 of her own savings Adina bought materials — beads pearls stones strips of leather chains — from wholesalers and got to work at the kitchen table at her parents' house.She named her line Adina's Jewels (after her grandmother with whom she shares a name). And once she built up enough inventory she started selling it door-to-door. But about three months in she realized she needed a better way to reach customers.She approached the owner of a local swimwear store and asked if she could display her jewelry on one of its tables. The idea worked for a little while but then sales tapered off. The swimwear business was too seasonal and in the off-season low foot traffic hurt her sales. Her parents then suggested she try selling at the hair salon down the block. "It was perfect because hair salons always have customers" she says. Sales took off -- and remained consistent throughout the year. Now four years later Adina's Jewels is a profitable multimillion dollar revenue business that has drawn the attention of tens of thousands of followers on Instagram. The company has a store in Brooklyn a web site selling more than 600 different items and a roster of celebrities including Ariana Grande Emily Ratajkowski and sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid photographed wearing the jewelry. Yet none of these successes have changed Adina's approach. While Adina's necklaces earrings rings and bracelets have become wildly popular it's critical to her that they remain affordable."I want people like me who don't come from a wealthy home to be able to buy beautiful jewelry" she says.In fact Adina still designs most of the pieces herself. The sterling silver and 14-karat gold-plated items for example are priced between $50 to $250. "Be your own boss"As Adina started to grow the business her brother Mayer Kamkhatchi jumped in to help.He was only 17 at the time but he set up the company's web site. "It was a lot of trial and error and learning stuff from YouTube" says Mayer who is now 20 and a senior at Baruch College majoring in entrepreneurship.The next step was to get some buzz around the brand. "We reached out to a fashion blogger who is a major fashion influencer on social media. They loved our vibe and talked about us" says Mayer.It was the breakthrough they needed. The site's traffic spiked as did sales. "It was a snowball effect" he says.And the buzz continues. "It's like someone will tell us they saw Ariana wear one of our rings and they want that same ring" says Mayer.The brand's growing popularity among its core 18-to-34-year-old "fashion-forward" customers as Mayer refers to them is also evident on social media where Adina's Jewels has racked up 140000 Instagram followers.Mayer now handles the day-to-day operations and marketing while Adina focuses on product design and customer relations.For both siblings entrepreneurship has been a goal they both have had from a very early age.Their parents who met on a blind date in New York immigrated to the United States when they were young — their father from Syria when he was 25 and their mother from Israel when she was 16. "When my father left Syria he had his own textile company which he had to give up" says Mayer. Now both parents work in sales positions at different companies."My parents really wanted us to be independent and work for ourselves" says Adina.As early as the third grade Adina could recall her mother encouraging her to aspire to be more than an employee. "She would say to me 'Adina don't work for anyone else. Be your own boss and write your own check'" she recalls.Adina and Mayer took that advice to heart. "I was selling stuff like lip glosses and hair accessories in third grade" says Adina. "I got such a rush from selling things." "It's hard for us to trust anyone else"To date Adina and Mayer have self-financed all of Adina's Jewels. "We've taken it upon ourselves to handle every aspect of the business" says Mayer. "It's been hard but we have trust issues." In 2016 the company opened its first brick-and-mortar store. A small neighborhood store had shut down and Adina acted fast."It was 500 square-feet the perfect size for a jewelry shop" she says. "It's kind of prestigious to have a store. I think it gives legitimacy to a brand."And after working out of their parents' home for the past few years they moved into an office space in August. Now about a dozen employees help with marketing web design and packing and shipping merchandise to customers in the US and overseas.The siblings are proud of their success. "But it goes back to our parents and how they raised us" says Adina. "They helped us on day one. I even call my dad late at night if I need business advice. They're always there to help.",Business
It was the middle of the night and Ayal Lanternari was rushing to warm up refrigerated breast milk for his three-month-old baby.His son Daniel was hungry and there was nothing Lanternari could do to speed up the process. The only safe way to heat up cold or frozen breast milk is by putting it under running warm water or in a bowl of warm water — a process that can take 10 minutes or more."You can't microwave breast milk or heat it directly on the stove because it will damage the nutrients and the immunological property in the milk" says Lanternari a biomedical engineer.But like most new parents he was tired and frustrated and thought there had to be a better way. That's when he got an idea: What if he designed a baby bottle that spread out the breast milk into a thinner layer? Doing that would expand the liquid's surface area allowing it to warm up faster without damaging the nutrients."The bottle kind of designed itself in my head" said Lanternari.Instead of a typical cylindrical shape the bottle he envisioned was round "similar to the shape of a breast" he said. Later that same day Lanternari called his best friend Asaf Kehat and told him about it. "My first reaction was there was something so simple and genius about it. It was an obvious solution" says Kehat who is also a biomedical engineer. "I researched the baby bottle market and couldn't find anything like what Ayal had thought of."The two joined forces and spent almost a year conducting research and working on the design. Then in February 2013 their company Nanobébé was born. The birth of a product line It would take several years before the two could bring their product to market.Lanternari and Kehat who were living in Israel at the time spent the next five years on research and development testing their bottle with hundreds of parents infants lactation consultants and pediatricians."This wasn't just another product. Babies were going to use it. So we had to be very careful" says Kehat. Besides the efficacy of it they designed the bottle with a modern stylish look and made it easy for babies to hold.Testing by the company's own R&D team as well as certified lactation consultants and medical professionals showed their bottle cut the milk's warming time by more than half to about three to five minutes. Conversely the bottle's circular shape also cooled breast milk twice as fast as a conventional bottle says Lantenari.In February the company unveiled a stackable feeding bottle selling it online at Babies 'R' Us and at Buy Buy Baby stores across the US. (Babies 'R' Us went out of business a few months later as part of Toys R Us' bankruptcy)Lanternari and Kehat opened a US office in Charleston South Carolina earlier this month.The two entrepreneurs picked Charleston because it was ideally suited as a distribution hub for both domestic and overseas customers. Lanternari who recently moved to Charleston with his wife and three young children says the city also has a strong pipeline of available skilled workers in the health care and business development arenas. But the company's headquarters remains in Tel Aviv where all of the products are made. Kehat has stayed in Israel to oversee those operations.Although Nanobébé started with a baby bottle the company has evolved into a whole ecosystem of products including breast milk bottles breast milk storage bags for the fridge and freezer a microwave steam sterilizer unit drying rack pacifiers and warming bowl for the bottles."All of the related products like the stackable breast milk freezer bags and drying tray carry the Nanobébé DNA of functionality and innovation" says Lanternari. The bottles feature a hollow center which makes them stackable. The freezer bags can also be stored horizontally on top of each other to save space. And the bottles come with an adapter to attach them to a variety of breast pumps.So far the products have been a hit. "We sold out of our products twice in the first month at Babies 'R' Us" says Lanternari. Although the retailers' bankruptcy was a setback for the fledgling business other national retailers have since picked up the brand including Target and Wal-Mart. Nanobébé products are in 170 Target stores so far he says. In January the brand will roll out in 1215 Wal-Mart stores.Best friends since childhoodLanternari and Kehat grew up together in Israel and have led parallel lives."We've known each other since we were five years old and have been best friends ever since" says Lanternari. "We are brothers."Both are 39. Their parents were neighbors. They were classmates in school and went to the same university — Israel's Technion Institute of Technology — and pursued the same major. After graduating Kehat joined medical device maker Mazor Robotics where he was a clinical and sales manager for several years. Lanternari started his career as an engineer with Novocure an oncology company that develops treatments for patients with solid tumors. He later worked for a company that managed engineering and infrastructure projects.Both men left their jobs in 2013 to focus on Nanobébé. At the outset they personally invested "hundred of thousands" of dollars of their own savings. But eventually they sought funding.To date the business has raised several million dollars from Israeli venture capital firms and InterTech Group a privately-held holding company.Nanobébé now employs 30 people and its bottle has won a number of industry awards including TTPM [Toys Tots Pets & Mom] Best of Baby Award for 2018. While the recognition is welcome Kehat said the company's mission is to keep the products affordable for parents. Prices range from $22.99 for a 3-pack of bottles to $49.99 for a "starter pack" with four bottles two pacifiers and a bottle warming bowl.As the company expands sales globally — the brand is also available in Israel France Belgium and Canada — Kehat says Nanobébé's team is working ahead on other innovative products."To get this kind of pickup for our first product in our launch year was completely unexpected" says Kehat adding that sales in just the first few months are "going amazing.""Our innovation isn't just for babies" he says. "It's for everyone's benefit — moms dads and caregivers." ,Business
Jeff Nesbit is author of This is the Way the World Ends and executive director of Climate Nexus. The opinions expressed in this commmentary are his own. The sobering report issued by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last month was a public jolt. The report found that the Earth's temperature will warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by as soon as 2030 sparking some devastating consequences. Like it or not if we are going to make any progress on climate change we are going to have to look to the business world. There are roughly 100 companies directly responsible for CO2 emissions outlined in the Carbon Majors report. Others in the utility and transportation sectors are indirectly responsible for carbon emissions.The good news is that more business leaders are recognizing that climate change is indeed a real threat and many are leading the way in making it a priority in business decisions.Here's how businesses can tackle climate change head-on: Make it a part of the businessSome boardrooms have begun to build climate risks into their assumptions and business plans. For some businesses it means making changes in their own supply chains that reduce CO2 emissions. Walmart for instance has pledged to reduce a gigaton of CO2 from its supply chain. For other companies it means shifting their own energy needs away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Google and Facebook are good examples of this. They have both committed to buying 100% of their energy needs from renewable sources. Support a carbon taxMany large multinational corporations now allocate resources to either mitigate damage or exposure from climate risks or to adapt to changing environments. They're doing so largely because they want regulatory certainty as well as a level playing field as governments begin to restrict carbon emissions in the next 20 years. More than a dozen industry sector leaders — including General Motors MetLife Exelon AT&T Johnson & Johnson Procter & Gamble PepsiCo Unilever Shell BP and Total — have agreed to support the proposed Climate Leadership Council's Baker-Shultz carbon dividends plan in the past year. This plan would set a national carbon price at $40 a ton in the first year and it would rise each year after that. The revenue from the carbon fee would be returned to US families as a dividend. The business community as a whole can and should support this prospoal.Turn to renewable energyRenewables now disrupt our biggest energy markets and industries such as transportation and utilities. Distributed-grid technologies offer homeowners and small businesses options to generate power for zero fuel costs. Vast new economies of scale drive down prices making clean energy easier cheaper and available to all. For businesses utilities should offer solar and wind options and have solar rooftops integrated into the electric grid. The cost of building solar plants is now as cheap as building a coal plant. Corporations are realizing that shifting to more efficient environmentally friendly renewable energy can be important to bottom lines. Pepsi and Coca-Cola have both chosen to address climate impacts affecting their supply chain. Two of the largest packaged food companies Kellogg and General Mills have environmental and climate data programs that map out risks and energy efficiency goals throughout their global supply chains. The programs embrace renewables as a way to find and improve efficiencies and reduce energy costs. But will such changes happen fast enough to stave off the worst impacts already occurring? Renewable energy needs to replace traditional energy as quickly as possible and electric vehicles need to replace the internal combustion engine in the next 10 to 15 years. Those are big seemingly impossible benchmarks. Consumers should demand this. But the next move could be revolutionary. Climate change has created the single greatest wealth opportunity in history. The free-market forge is poised to refine a $90 trillion thing of beauty and wonder by using a "carbon price signal" sufficient to engineer a low-carbon energy economy. Will America's business leaders choose to grab this hammer and aim it at the anvil to remake the world before it's too late — especially if tens of millions of technology-savvy consumers actively support that change for all our best interests on this shared planet?,Business
New York (CNN Business)Beds-in-a-box have brought the country's largest mattress retailer to its knees.Mattress Firm filed for bankruptcy on Friday to escape hundreds of leases it could no longer afford in suburban shopping malls and on city streets.Mattress Firm has more than 3300 stores across the country and it plans to quickly shutter 200 of them. By the end of the year the company may close up to 500 more.Mattress Firm's struggles have been in part self-inflicted. The company failed to recognize that its marketplace was moving online until it was too late. It misjudged what shoppers demanded — convenience and low prices — and ignored the threat digital upstarts like Casper posed to its grip on the industry. The company was constrained by its decision to buy retail chain Sleepy's in 2015 for $780 million. Instead of investing in digital tools and shipping infrastructure Mattress Firm expanded its store base at exactly the wrong moment. "This transformational acquisition unites the nation's two largest mattress specialty retailers providing customers with convenience value and choice" Mattress Firm's chief executive Steve Stagner said at the time.But taking on more than 1000 Sleepy's stores left Mattress Firm over-retailed. As store traffic slowed costly leases turned into an albatross around Mattress Firm's neck. In a Chapter 11 filing Stanger said that his company had "too many locations in close proximity to each other."Mattress Firm built out its stores as an effective online direct-to-consumer model began to emerge.Casper as well as Tuft & Needle Leesa Purple and Yogabed took advantage of retailers clinging to the status quo by offering shoppers a new solution for their bedding needs: shipping mattresses in a box to their homes for no added costs. "Traditional mattress retailers have been alienating customers for decades and are now buckling under pressure" Philip Krim Casper's co-founder and CEO said in an email. "Casper has turned a tired industry on its head with innovative products and a superior shopping experience."Casper believed that shoppers had grown weary of the traditional mattress-buying experience: going into a store testing out a handful of mattresses for a few minutes and rushing to a decision about an expensive item designed to last for years. Customers were also turned off by complicated and expensive delivery options.The company gained attention online with customers posting viral videos of themselves unboxing mattresses racking up $100 million in sales in 2015.Casper distinguished its business by pricing the only mattress it sold at the time below traditional competitors as well as offering free delivery and a 100-day trial period at home.Casper offered just three varieties of mattresses which gave it an advantage over stores that sold a confusing array of soft mattresses firm foam springy and everything in between."Consumers have long gone into traditional mattress stores feeling uninformed and have been subject to ridiculous price points" Bob Phibbs CEO of the consultancy Retail Doctor told CNN Business in August.Casper continued selling direct-to-consumer online moving into bed frames sheets pillows and dog mattresses and it partnered with retailers like Nordstrom Target and West Elm to increase distribution.By the time Mattress Firm launched its own bed-in-a-box brand Tulo in 2017 it was too deep in debt to escape its troubles.The rise of online companies wasn't the only source of pressure on Mattress Firm. Walmart has come out with its own brand: Allswell. Last week Amazon debuted its own memory foam mattress under its AmazonBasics line. In addition a top Mattress Firm supplier Tempur Sealy International stopped selling to the company over a pricing dispute. And Mattress Firm's parent company Steinhoff International has been bogged down with accounting woes that forced its CEO to resign last year.Still physical retail remains an important component of the mattress market. In August Casper announced it would open 200 stores in the next three years in an attempt to build loyalty with current shoppers and reach new ones.Mattress Firm hopes a slimmed down store footing will allow it to remain relevant with shoppers who need a new bed."The process we have initiated today will allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and accelerate the optimization of our store portfolio" said CEO Stagner.—CNN Business' Jordan Valinsky contributed to this story.,Business
After 22 years away from 9-to-5 work Jennifer Fleck returned to her first career as an engineer.During her time off she raised three kids started a local orchestra and worked part-time in a variety of businesses from direct sales to program management. She always talked about one day returning to engineering. But over time she says that faith in her abilities began to wane. "I always said 'I can always go back to engineering. I can never get time back with my kids' — but as time went on I didn't believe that as much" she says. "I didn't want to go out and sell myself as a potential program manager or an engineer because I wasn't convinced [of my abilities]." But one day scrolling through Facebook she came across a link to Take 2 — the General Motors career re-entry program aimed at recruiting more experienced employees back to the workforce after they've taken a long break. Fleck talked with her family touched up her résumé and sent in her application.The 12-week program was her ideal transition back into the workforce. She brushed up on her engineering education caught up on technological changes and — most importantly she says — learned how to start seeing her "break" as another chapter in her career journey."I feel like I'm constantly dusting off cobwebs and I feel consciously incompetent in many areas" Fleck says. "I know I don't know a lot of stuff — but I'm willing to learn." A diversity of experience Career reentry programs — or "returnships" as they're sometimes called — offer women and men an opportunity to "try out" the big transition back into the workforce. Workers that have taken years or even decades off from full-time work either to raise children help with elderly relatives or deal with personal health issues have been able to gradually return to successful careers at companies like IBM Goldman Sachs General Motors and others. Extended time away from a career means employees miss out on training and market developments but it also means they're gaining other skills and bringing some needed diversity to the existing workforce says Megan Hogan vice president and head of diversity recruiting at Goldman Sachs. "Definitely it's a diversity program" she says. "Returnships fit squarely in my purview. It's about diversity of experience." Lori Taylor a participant in Goldman Sach's returnship program and now a vice president in the bank's risk division says the opportunity felt like a chance to "hit the ground running" after six and a half years away from the workforce. "To be able to come in and realize my skills experience and training were still relevant that what I knew was still very applicable — it made that transition really easy" she says. "It helped with confidence I would say and feeling like I was able to contribute right away." In order to qualify for both the Goldman Program and GM's Take 2 participants have to have been away from the workforce for at least two years. Some return to the work they were doing before their breaks but others train for entirely new careers in other fields so previous experience is not necessary. Fleck says the 12-week program at GM taught her to see her time away from her career in a different light. Her engineering skills hadn't vanished and in fact her time as a full-time mom even expanded her skillset."It can be overwhelming with the number of issues the number of emails across my screen" Fleck says. "But with raising kids and volunteering and working you're constantly bombarded with different issues and you need to be able to bounce back and forth between different issues. So I think my experience both as a parent and working to get stuff done at home it helps me manage stuff better." A diversity of skillBut women and men reentering the workforce may still battle stereotypes about their age their abilities or the length of their break says Lauren Rikleen president of the Rikleen Institute for Strategic Leadership. "All the old stereotypes persist: 'You've been out of the workplace a few years and you're not going to be able to catch on or be as quick' ... the biggest issue for me is that it discounts the importance of wisdom" Rikleen says. "Wisdom is something you only get with age and experience and no matter how smart you are in college or your early jobs the wisdom from working through problems and hardships and failures and is an invaluable component in the workplace and should be thought of as a critical part of any team." Fleck and Taylor both say they initially worried about catching up with the technological changes that now populate offices. "The computer and Skype and the conference calls and the video systems — I was worried every time I flubbed something up they'd say 'Oh you can't do this'" Fleck says. But as more experienced workers introduce more age diversity into the workforce they also bring maturity and some much-needed institutional knowledge. If anything sometimes these returning workers have skills that are even rarer among younger employees interns and recent college graduates says Scott Klott talent acquisition lead at General Motors. He points out that some of GM's IT systems still run on a mainframe a specialty that's harder and harder to find. "You don't get many college grads who say 'I want to be a professional in the mainframe space'" he says. "But especially someone who has been a mainframe developer who took time off they're coming back and saying 'Who really wants a mainframe developer? My skills are antiquated. Who wants me?' and the answer is 'We do! You're really hard to find. We need your talent.'"Returning employees are bringing something else valuable: maturity and perspective. In the first part of her career Fleck says she really struggled to be taken seriously as a female engineer. She remembers having to "route" ideas through men in order for them to be accepted."If I come up with questions and ideas people seem to take me more seriously" she says of her job now. "I think it's a combination: people have changed but also I have more confidence in me and it comes across.",Business
The world's most popular car just got a makeover. Toyota unveiled the new 2020 Corolla sedan which promises to be more efficient and more enjoyable to drive than the current model. A hatchback version of the car was unveiled last April at the New York Auto Show and is on sale now but the sedan is the car most people recognize as "the Corolla."The generally unexciting unassuming Corolla long ago passed such cultural icons as Ford's Model T and Volkswagen's Beetle on its way to becoming the best-selling car model ever. More than 45 million have been sold globally since the Corolla was introduced in 1966 helping to usher in a period of rapid growth for the Japanese auto industry.Its popularity helped make Toyota the global force it is today. So while the unveiling of a new multimillion dollar supercar may seem more exciting the introduction of a new Corolla is unquestionably more important for both the auto industry and for far more people who actually buy cars.From a business standpoint the most important thing about this new car is that once it goes on sale around the globe the Corolla will be essentially the same car everywhere. In recent years cars called the Corolla that were sold in different parts of the world have not always been closely related. In the United States alone Toyota dealers sold the Corolla and the Corolla iM two completely different small cars with the same name.Now all Corollas including the hatchback and the sedan will be based on the same engineering "architecture" that is also shared with the Prius and the C-HR small crossover. It's called the TNGA-C for Toyota New Global Architecture Compact. It's part of a bid by Toyota (TM) to save costs by radically simplifying its product lineup around the world.There will still be different versions of the Corolla targeted at different audiences. The hatchback and sedan for a start will have slightly different personalities. The hatchback is aimed at buyers looking for a bit more excitement and driving enjoyment. That's reflected in stiffer suspension settings that give it a harsher ride said Gabe Shenhar an auto tester for Consumer Reports. Since it's available now Consumer Reports has already tested the hatchback. The sedan meanwhile will be available in a (relatively speaking) "performance" version as well as in a luxury version and for those who want it all a luxury-performance version. There will also be of course the basic car for the budget conscious consumer who just wants a way to get around without burning a lot of gas or a lot of cash. The Corolla will also be available in the United States as a hybrid for the first time. Hybrid Corollas have previously been available in other markets.Compared to today's Corolla the design is just a little more crisp and modern. Toyota is promising better performance driving feel and fuel economy in this new model. While there have been some Corollas in the past that were known for performance the Corolla sedan currently on the market is definitely not one of them. Its popularity is based on a reputation for practicality and solid dependability not fun and excitement. Toyota is also promising lots of standard and optional safety technologies in the new car.Car buyers particularly in the US have been shifting more toward crossover SUVs of all sizes. That's prompted some car brands like Ford to drop sedans from their lineups"There are becoming fewer and fewer new vehicles in that $20000 or under category" she said.Pricing for the new Corolla sedan hasn't been announced yet but the current version starts at under $19000. The 2020 Toyota Corolla will go on sale next Spring. ,Business
You have seven seconds to make an impression with your résumé. So you better make every one count. "Those first seven seconds someone spends on your résumé are the deciding seconds on whether they like you or not" said salary and hiring coach Olivia Jaras. "They spend the rest of the time trying to corroborate that first impression."Jaras is the founder of Salary Coaching for Women which helps clients get hired and negotiate salaries. Your résumé does more than just get you an interview it also plays a role in determining your salary she said. That's why the format word choice and tone are important to getting the reader on your side. "It's playing mind games" Jaras said. "A good résumé doesn't sound too pushy aggressive or assertive. It's a more subtle energy."'Here's how to craft a résumé that will get you hired:  Header: keep it simple The top of your résumé is precious real estate. All you really need there is your name phone number and email. "If they need your street address they will find or ask for it" Jaras said. She also cautioned against going overboard with fonts and colors.Summary: tell them who you are This first section of a résumé should be two or three sentences that detail who you are and where you are in your career your strengths and capabilities and how you can best fill the needs of the employer."You have to set the tone in a way that they like you and are excited to continue to read" said Jaras. Show the company the value you bring. Read the job posting carefully for hints on what the employer is looking for."The job posting will tell you what the needs are so when you are writing this section anticipate the needs that are going unfilled by virtue of this vacancy." Using phrases like "had the good fortune" makes you come across as more thankful and approachable according to Jaras."If you were to say 'I've directed...' the way you come across is very different and not at all thankful."She advised job seekers to italicize the summary paragraph. "This shows this is the intro to the résumé" and sets the tone."Experience: tell them what you can do This is the only place where you can brag — carefully. The experience section should include your current and past job titles responsibilities and accomplishments. List two or three bullet points of responsibilities for each position.

When is the best time to get out of a mutual fund?After a recent stock market dip Ian Bloom a financial planner in North Carolina got a panicked call from a VIP client: his mom."I have to sell everything!" she told him.He assured her as he does all his clients that if she did she would lose much more than she would gain because they had created a financial plan that already accounted for market sell-offs. Now would come the hard part: sticking to it.Fluctuations in the market can leave investors looking at their mutual funds with disdain. They may feel their money could work harder elsewhere. That may be true. There are situations in which selling mutual fund shares works to your advantage. But you could also encounter adverse consequences. Move on your strategy not on the marketThe time to sell a mutual fund is when you need the liquidity and you have planned ahead to make the move says Eric Gabor certified financial planner and founder of Eagle Grove Advisors."Any kind of decline in the market or reaction to a geo-political event is not the time to sell" he said.Individual investors should only sell funds when their situation calls for a need to make a change says Amy Hubble a certified financial planner and principal investment adviser at Radix Financial. Investors may need cash she says or need to reduce risk as a need for cash draws nearer. "Or maybe your target allocation to that asset class has grown outside its tolerance compared to the rest of the portfolio" says Hubble. "For example you had a strategic allocation of 10% and it's now 17% of your portfolio." But it can be hard for investors to remember that they need to sit on their hands when they hear bad news.It's not uncommon for a novice investor to want to sell their investments when they see declines in the market says Leah Hadley a certified divorce financial analyst and chief executive of Great Lakes Investment Management. "That's why we work with clients to determine an appropriate level of liquidity so that there is less temptation to sell when the market is down."Keep in mind that your mutual funds might include more than just US stocks says Bloom head of Open World Financial Life Planning. "Your portfolio will include funds that include different parts of the market" he says. "Sure there's the S&P but there might also be bonds international and emerging markets. When the market goes down no one is talking about the other parts the international investments the bonds. The part that stands out is the part that is in the red: the S&P."Red flags While your plan is to stick with your strategy for the duration of your timeline there are mutual fund red flags that could merit a change. "I will consider making a change in portfolios if there has been a change in the fund's strategy and it no longer makes sense in my overall strategy with the client" says Hadley. "I will also sell out of a mutual fund that is consistently under-performing the relevant benchmark."Gabor recommends watching the fund manager too. "If a manger leaves a fund they have managed for many years and a new successor is named that may be a time to re-evaluate how it fits into your portfolio."He adds that investors should also be on the lookout for tax inefficient funds."You could get out if there are large inverse tax consequences" says Gabor. "That's why I like tax-managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds."Watch out for high turnover ratios says Hubble like those over 25% per year. "Funds with high turnover ratios mean the fund is managed tax inefficiently and you're likely to receive unannounced short-term capital gain distributions at the end of the year which have high tax costs."Another red flag is high expense ratios. "This is the most important number to look at in a fund" says Hubble. "Do not pay managers more than 1% to underperform the market half the time in long-term savings accounts.  Do yourself a favor and for long-term money skip the active managers altogether and invest in low-cost index funds."  The consequences of getting outIf an investor does decide to liquidate the fund keep an eye on your tax liability."If the investor has held the fund for a less than a year all capital gains will be taxed at their income level" says Timothy Kenney a certified financial planner and founder of TK Pacific Wealth. "If they have held the fund for greater than a year they can get a little break in the capital gains tax maybe 5% or 20% depending on your tax bracket but they may have a big tax bill to pay next year since we've been in a bull market for so long."If you have a fund you are looking to sell and it happens to be at a loss Kenney suggests paying attention to the capital gains distribution.  Funds tend to pay capital gains toward the end of the year and by selling before the distribution you avoid getting hit with the tax.  Have an investing question?

Washington DC (CNN)The scooter-sharing startup Lime continues to clash with its suppliers amid questions about the safety of its scooters.Chinese company Okai is pushing back on claims that it's the source of flawed Lime scooters.Earlier this month Lime said it removed all of its scooters manufactured by Okai following reports that the baseboard where users stand can snap in half and endanger riders. Some riders have suffered injuries and an Okai scooter may have contributed to a fatality. Lime uses scooters from multiple manufacturers but doesn't reveal exactly how many. In late October Lime stated the baseboard on its Okai models could break if ridden off a curb at high speeds.Okai said Friday Lime's claims are "groundless" and the faulty scooters come from another supplier."We feel it necessary to make cautions to the public on the credibility of such statements made by Lime" Okai said in a statement sent to CNN Business on Friday. "Obviously Lime has other suppliers whose scooters broke."Lime declined to comment on whether it has recalled scooters from other manufacturers.Photos on social media and in news reports revealed Lime scooters with broken floorboards -- some of which match images of the scooter model Okai says it provided to Lime. But not all looked the same. The Okai model has a distinct set of lights and screws the manufacturer said in its statement. Okai said it sold 32000 scooters to Lime but the company has not revealed how many scooters it has removed from streets. When it recalled some scooters over battery concerns earlier this year the issue impacted less than 0.01% of its fleet Lime said.The company said it is working with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate its Okai scooters.In 2017 Lime launched as LimeBike a dockless bikesharing startup. But this year it shifted its focus to scooters after Bird a Santa Monica startup pioneered a popular scooter-sharing service. Lime has since raised hundreds of millions of dollars including from Uber. Lime operates in 10 countries and more than 85 US cities. Scooters have been shown to reduce car trips earning praise from environmentalists and city experts. But safety questions have followed the company's rapid expansion. In September a Dallas man died shortly after a crash while riding a Lime scooter. Police discovered the scooter was broken in half but the company hasn't said if the man was riding an Okai scooter. Along with fellow Lime supplier Ninebot Okai is calling on scooter companies to do more to protect scooters from the wear-and-tear of daily use."It is the operator's responsibility to ensure proper and prompt management and maintenance of the scooters it puts into the co-sharing market" Okai said.Lime has already taken some steps to tackle safety concerns. It announced a $3 million program to distribute 250000 helmets and educate riders on safety practices. Lime recently unveiled a new scooter with safety improvements such as larger wheels intended to better handle potholes and uneven roads.Companies are racing to meet demand and expand to new cities. But the Silicon Valley-backed companies have grown at a breakneck pace which has drawn criticism for introducing problems at a scale that wouldn't occur with steadier growth. Some view scooters as clutter because they're sometimes parked incorrectly such as blocking sidewalks.According to Tony Ho vice president of business development at the Chinese company Ninebot which makes a majority of the shared scooters in use worldwide the scooter-sharing industry is so new that issues continue to pop up. He said Ninebot plans to release a new model later this year that's better designed for harsh conditions. Shared scooters are typically ridden a half-dozen times a day on roads of varying quality and in inclement weather. Scooters are often thrown to the ground or tossed in the back of trucks to be charged. And minor cracks can expose components leading to malfunctions. "There's room to improve in how to operate and how to train chargers" Ho said of the scooter-sharing startups. "This is almost like a new test for us. The product needs to sustain a real industrial type of environment."Segway is also shifting the battery in its scooters to the baseboard. This will lower the center of gravity making them less likely to tip over and expose riders to head injuries. "It's gonna be a beast" Ho said of the new scooter.,Business
Hong Kong (CNN Business)Bitcoin's slump is causing a big headache for one of Silicon Valley's top tech firms. Computer chipmaker Nvidia's stock plunged nearly 17% in after hours trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday after the company's third quarter financial results came in significantly lower than expected. Nvidia (NVDA) specializes in making hardware for video game consoles and digital currency mining the process by which computers are used to create bitcoin But bitcoin prices have more than halved this year after a spectacular rally in 2017. That has hit demand for Nvidia's technology the company revealed Thursday causing unsolved inventory of its products to pile up.    "The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on a conference call with investors Thursday.  Things could get worse before they get better with the price of bitcoin recently falling to its lowest level in a year. Nvidia said for the current holiday season quarter it now only expects to record revenues of $2.7 billion compared to analyst forecasts of about $3.4 billion. Nvidia isn't the only big US tech firm to suffer as a result of the crypto rout. Rival chipmaker AMD (AMD) reported lower than expected earnings last quarter blaming the cryptocurrency slump for a slowdown in sales. The company said it expects revenue to fall below analyst expectations in the current quarter as well. AMD's stock was down about 5% in after hours trading.The sell-off in tech stocks spread to Asia on Friday. SoftBank (SFTBF) fell more than 3% while video game maker Nintendo (NTDOY) dropped more than 9%. Nintendo is a major customer of Nvidia and any sign that Nintendo is buying fewer chips makes investors worry about demand for its own gaming systems said Pelham Smithers head of UK-based investment firm Pelham Smithers Associates. Founded in 1993 Nvidia started off selling computer cards that improved the performance of video games. But it's since expanded into bigger and pricier areas. Today one Nvidia product the DGX can cost as much as $149000.Among Nvidia's key backers are Japanese tech giant SoftBank whose $93 billion Vision Fund holds a sizable stake in the firm. ,Business
New York (CNN)Facebook is admitting it needs oversight with content moderation.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday the company plans to establish an independent group to oversee users' appeals of content policy decisions starting next year.Critcs have long urged the company to exhibit greater transparency into what content Facebook's human moderators and artificial intelligence take down keep up and why. The news which was announced on a call with reporters came one day after a report from The New York Times revealed how Facebook execs including Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg navigated the company's recent crises ranging from Russian interference to data privacy. The company's response included digging up dirt on competitors and critics according to the report."I think people want to trust our intention" said Zuckerberg who said the press call announcement was scheduled before the report published. "People expect companies to learn and not keep making the same mistake." Facebook's decisions have come back to bite the company in recent years. For example human rights groups have slammed Facebook for not properly cracking down on the hate and misinformation that fueled political division and violence in Myanmar. Facebook admitted it was "too slow" to act. "I've increasingly come to believe that Facebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on our own" Zuckerberg wrote on Thursday in a blog post which provided updates on the company's content governance and enforcement processes. "The purpose of this body would be to uphold the principle of giving people a voice while also recognizing the reality of keeping people safe."Zuckerberg noted that while the details of the independent group are not yet determined -- including how it will select members and ensure its independence -- it'll aim to provide more transparency into decisions. Earlier this year the company finally made public its detailed internal community standards policies detailing what is and what's not acceptable content including hate speech nudity and bullying. Facebook also started rolling out a content appeals process this year for users inquiring about their own content that's been removed. The company said Thursday it will expand on this concept so users can appeal decision on reports filed on other people's content. In addition Facebook said it is training AI to detect and reduce the spread of "borderline content" which it describes as "click-bait and misinformation." "People naturally engage with more sensational content" said Zuckerberg adding the company is trying to de-incentivize that.By late next year the company expects to release transparency and enforcement reports on a quarterly basis he said. ,Business
New York (CNN)Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg have spent much of Thursday swinging back after a New York Times investigation published Wednesday suggested that the company had not been forthcoming enough about Russian interference on its platform and reported that it had hired a firm that dug up dirt on its competitors.Participating in a conference call with reporters Thursday that was meant to be about rules regarding how Facebook polices its platform Zuckerberg instead had to focus mainly on the Times' story and reporters' questions about it. He began the call by addressing the Times' story acknowledging — in a line that has become something of a company mantra — that Facebook had been too slow to deal with the Russian disinformation problem on its platform in 2016 but saying that "to suggest we weren't interested in knowing the truth" was "simply untrue."Facebook has spent a great deal of its time and energy over the past two years handling increasing scrutiny from the public and from Washington arising out of its inaction in 2016. One step it took during that period was to hire Definers Public Affairs a DC-based conservative firm which did PR work for Facebook — and dug up dirt on the company's competitors and its critics.Zuckerberg said during the call that he only learned about the company's work with Definers when he read the Times' article.After he'd read the article he said "I got on the phone with our team and we are no longer working with this firm."He said Facebook would need to ensure it was not working with similar companies.Facebook had earlier announced its decision to end its relationship with Definers which had pushed negative stories about other tech companies and about Facebook's critics some of which were posted on a conservative website linked to the firm. The Times reported that Definers had circulated a document earlier this year encouraging reporters to examine the links between liberal billionaire George Soros and a group campaigning to break up Facebook.Online criticism of Soros is sometimes explicitly anti-Semitic and sometimes harkens back to anti-Semitic tropes. Some of the backlash that followed the Times' report came from critics suggesting Facebook had engaged in dog whistle politics. Zuckerberg told reporters on Thursday that he had "tremendous respect" for Soros even though they disagreed about the impact of the internet.A statement from Facebook earlier in the day read "Definers did encourage members of the press to look into the funding of 'Freedom from Facebook' an anti-Facebook organization. The intention was to demonstrate that it was not simply a spontaneous grassroots campaign as it claimed but supported by a well-known critic of our company. To suggest that this was an anti-Semitic attack is reprehensible and In the same statement Facebook said "The New York Times is wrong to suggest that we ever asked Definers to pay for or write articles on Facebook's behalf -- or to spread misinformation. Our relationship with Definers was well known by the media -- not least because they have on several occasions sent out invitations to hundreds of journalists about important press calls on our behalf" a Facebook statement read.Patrick Gaspard the president of Open Society Foundations which Soros founded wrote to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Wednesday saying Facebook had attempted to distract from its accountability problems."I was shocked to learn from the New York Times that you and your colleagues at Facebook hired a Republican opposition research firm to stir up animus toward George Soros. As you know there is a concerted right-wing effort the world over to demonize Mr. Soros and his foundations which I lead—an effort which has contributed to death threats and the delivery of a pipe bomb to Mr. Soros' home. You are no doubt also aware that much of this hateful and blatantly false and Anti-Semitic information is spread via Facebook" Gaspard wrote.Sandberg's handling of Facebook's approach to the fallout from misinformation and interference on the platform was one of the primary focuses of the Times' report. On Thursday's call with reporters Zuckerberg praised Sandberg describing her as an "important partner." The Times also reported that Joel Kaplan a former aide to George W. Bush who is now Facebook's vice president of global public policy advised against the company publishing a paper in early 2017 detailing the extent of Russian interference on the platform.Kaplan became a lightning rod for controversy inside and outside the company last month when he attended the Senate confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh his friend and former Bush administration colleague.Color of Change a progressive civil advocacy group that was according to The Times included in a brief compiled by Definers called on Thursday for Facebook to fire Kaplan.A Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business that Kaplan continues to have the confidence of the company's leaders and that he was not involved in Definers' work for the company.A spokesperson for Definers said in a statement to CNN Business on Thursday morning "We are proud to have partnered with Facebook over the past year on a range of public affairs services. All of our work is based on publicly-available documents and information. The document referenced in the Times story regarding the anti-Facebook organization's potential funding sources was entirely factual and based on public records including public statements by one of its organizers about receiving funding from Mr. Soros' foundation."Before the call began Facebook's board of directors — on which Zuckerberg serves as chairmain — put out a statement responding to the Times' article. "As Mark and Sheryl made clear to Congress the company was too slow to spot Russian interference and too slow to take action. As a board we did indeed push them to move faster. But to suggest that they knew about Russian interference and either tried to ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened is grossly unfair" the statement read. "In the last eighteen months Facebook with the full support of this board has invested heavily in more people and better technology to prevent misuse of its services including during elections. As the US mid-term showed they have made considerable progress and we support their continued to efforts to fight abuse and improve security."In a statement provided to CNN Business a spokesperson for the Times said "Our story is accurate and we stand by it. The monthslong investigation by a team of reporters was based on interviews with more than 50 sources including current and former Facebook executives and other employees lawmakers and government officials lobbyists and congressional staff members."CNN Business' Brian Stelter contributed reporting. ,Business
New York (CNN)"Saturday Night Live" had a very special message for President Trump from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.Bezos who was played by this week's host Steve Carell came on to explain about why the company chose Arlington Virginia and New York's Long Island City in Queens as the locations for Amazon's next headquarters."As you know Amazon just announced the location of its two new headquarters in New York and Virginia and everyone -- except for the people who live there and the people who live in all the places we didn't choose -- is thrilled" Carell in a bald cap as Bezos said. Carell's Bezos then explained that some felt the choice was Bezos' way of trolling the President who has been critical of Amazon in the past by choosing his old hometown of Queens and new location near Washington D.C. "But that's simply not true" he said. "I chose our locations because they were ideal for growing business not just to make Donald Trump think about how I'm literally 100 times richer than he is."Carell's Amazon CEO continued by saying that the real reason he wanted to talk to viewers had nothing to do with Trump."I am here to announce a brand new delivery option... 'Amazon Caravan'" Carell's Bezos said. "Any package going to any Trump building will get delivered by hundreds of Honduran and Mexican immigrants."That is according to the fake Bezos unless consumers order Trump's book "The Art of the Deal" which costs more to ship because "it's heavier.""I guess it's the only book with four chapter elevens" Carell smirked. The shots kept coming as Carell's Bezos announced new drones that were donning Trump-like wigs."The style of the hair is completely random" he said. "I just wanted something that looks so silly that everybody knows it was fake."The special message ended by saying this was a "sick burn" by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.,Business
 (CNN)Last week's disturbance at Fox News host Tucker Carlson's home remains under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington D.C.A group of left-wing activists showed up held signs criticizing Carlson and shouted threats. Someone spray-painted an anarchy symbol on the driveway. The protest has been widely condemned by many members of the media including multiple anchors at CNN.But one detail from the November 7 disturbance has come under scrutiny. Carlson told the Washington Post that "someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door."Liberal critics of Carlson have cast doubt on that claim by saying there was no evidence of damage to the door. They have accused him of lying and exaggerating to score political points. So CNN contacted the D.C. police and asked about the door. The police report about the incident did not mention any damage on the door. Was there any sign that it was cracked as Carlson claimed?A police spokeswoman responded "MPD did not observe any visible damage to the front door of the victim's house the night of the incident."It is still possible that the door was cracked. And there is no doubt that the overall incident was disturbing to the Carlsons. While Tucker was at work when the activists showed up his wife Susan was home alone. She called the police when she heard "loud banging and pounding on her front door" according to the police report.In videos uploaded to Twitter by the group which calls itself an "anti-fascist" or Antifa group in DC last Wednesday protesters were heard saying "Tucker Carlson we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!" They called him a "racist scumbag" and hurled epithets.The police speaking of the incident said "a group of protesters broke the law by defacing private property."But the disputed detail about the door has come up several times. Carlson's friend and business partner Neil Patel repeated the description on CNN's "Reliable Sources" last weekend."People start pounding on her door and throwing themselves at the door to the point where the door actually cracked" he said.President Trump talked about it in a Wednesday interview with the conservative site The Daily Caller which Carlson and Patel co-founded.The interviewer said: "They cracked the door — what is this violence? Where does it come from? Do you have a message for Tucker and his family?""I do" Trump said "I spoke to Tucker and I think Tucker's a great guy and I think it's terrible they were actually trying to break down the door."The group defended its decision to show up at Carlson's home. They believe Carlson supports and promotes a white nationalist agenda on Fox News a charge Carlson denies.After many journalists and commentators came to Carlson's defense last week arguing that a person's family and home should not be targeted some of Carlson's detractors pushed back by pointing to discrepancies in the accounts. Alan Pyke a reporter for the liberal site ThinkProgress wrote a first-person account of the protest and said one protester knocked firmly on Carlson's front door "three times" but then rejoined the rest of the group in the street. "This person did not throw their body against the door as Carlson has claimed to newspapers" Pyke wrote.Carlson's critics said he should provide a picture of the crack.Carlson did not respond to CNN's specific questions about that. So the Washington Post's Erik Wemple wrote Thursday "the search for corroborating evidence continues." He noted that when he visited Carlson's home with a colleague one day after the disturbance the door "seemed sturdy and fully intact. A woman who answered a knock looked it up and down and appeared to conclude it was in fine shape. It appeared to close snugly." Carlson responded angrily to Wemple's inquiries. And he responded angrily when contacted by CNN about the police's statement that officers did not observe any visible damage to the door."CNN has repeatedly defended Antifa and you are doing it again now" he said in a statement through Fox News. "Your story is a disgusting attempt to minimize an attack on my family and bring more pain to my wife and four children. I'm not playing along. I hope you're ashamed of yourself. You should be."For the record I said on last week's "Reliable Sources" that "it is absolutely inappropriate and unacceptable for protesters to show up at his own home to try to make him feel threatened where he lives."The D.C. police said last week that they are investigating the incident given the defacing of private property that occurred.On Thursday the MPD spokeswoman said "there is no further information to provide as this case remains under investigation. There have been no arrests made.",Business
New York  (CNN Business)The US box office is on track to break records this year crossing the $10 billion mark faster than ever before. Big films like Marvel's "Black Panther" and surprise hits like "A Quiet Place" have so far contributed to the massive domestic box office haul which is 10.5% ahead of last year and 5.7% ahead of 2016's record year according to ComScore. And there are still several months left in 2018. The hits came all year in 2018 and not just during the summer blockbuster months like most have in the past. "Black Panther" "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Venom" all set records at the box office and did so in February April and October respectively. It wasn't just comic book movies either. "Halloween" "A Star Is Born" and "A Quiet Place" all exceeded expectations at the box office making it an endless summer at the cineplex. A year round blockbuster schedule has been a growing trend in Hollywood but other factors such as diversity and the popularity of movie subscription services such as MoviePass has really helped put 2018 over the top.BoxOffice.com chief analyst Shawn Robbins told CNN Business that he would be "shocked" if 2018 didn't turn out to be a banner year for the box office. "We've seen so much momentum up to this point that it would probably take an unpredictable outside force to prevent a new record" he said.In 2016 the film industry raked in $11.4 billion but that achievement came with a bit of an asterisk since the record numbers could be attributed in part to a rise in ticket prices rather than more foot traffic at theaters.Paul Dergarabedian senior media analyst at Comscore believes that there's more than just inflation at work this year."Certainly increased ticket prices powers higher revenue but the gains this year are not just in terms of a rising dollar" Dergarabedian told CNN Business. "A 10% plus advantage over 2017 means that more people are indeed going to the movies." Robbins also pointed out that diversity dominated the box office in 2018 with nearly half of the top 20 films starring or co-starring women or people of color. That includes "Black Panther" "Ocean's 8" and "Crazy Rich Asians.""Representation on the big screen has taken a huge leap forward this year" he said.MoviePass could've also had a hand in the box office's successful year.The subscription service which made a splash when it began charging $10 a month for access to one movie a day skyrocketed in popularity this year accumulating 3 million subscribers before crashing back to earth over the summer.While its impact is hard to gauge Jeff Bock senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations believes MoviePass may have given a bit of a boost to this year's numbers."MoviePass and other subscription-based services cannot be undervalued" Bock told CNN Business. "Even though MoviePass is struggling they ushered in a new way of movie going and jolted the industry."The final stretch of 2018 begins this weekend with "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald." The prequel which takes place in the wizarding world of Harry Potter nabbed $9.1 million on Thursday night and is expected to bring in around $65 million at the domestic box office for Warner Bros.There are still more potential hits to come as 2018 winds down: "Ralph Breaks the Internet" and "Creed II" come out next week and "Aquaman" and "Mary Poppins Returns" premiere next month."I don't see anything stopping the box office avalanche at this point" Bock added. That avalanche could slide into 2019 which may be another record year with films such as "Avengers 4" "The Lion King" and "Star Wars: Episode IX" all on the docket.,Business
 (CNN)Lawyers for CNN and the Trump administration are awaiting an initial ruling on the network's federal lawsuit over press access to the White House. And they're going to have to wait a little while longer.Judge Timothy J. Kelly heard nearly two hours of oral arguments about CNN's request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on Wednesday. Then he said court would reconvene Thursday at 3 p.m.But on Thursday afternoon he rescheduled the next hearing for Friday at 10 a.m.If Kelly grants CNN's requests on Friday CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta would get his press pass back for a short period of time. If it's denied Acosta's pass will remain suspended.Either way this is just round one. By filing for a temporary restraining order CNN is seeking what's known as "emergency relief." CNN is arguing that Acosta's First Amendment rights are being violated every day he is banned from White House grounds.CNN is also asking for "permanent relief" meaning a declaration from the judge that President Trump's revocation of Acosta's press pass was unconstitutional. This legal conclusion could protect other reporters from retaliation by the administration. But the judge will not be ruling on that yet. Kelly is only expected to weigh in on the temporary status of Acosta's press pass.Further hearings are likely to take place in the next few weeks according to CNN's lawyers.The White House took the unprecedented step of suspending Acosta's access after he had a combative exchange with Trump at last week's post-midterms press conference. CNN sought a resolution for several days before filing suit on Tuesday. The resulting lawsuit by both CNN and Acosta alleges violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. The defendants are Trump and several of his top aides.The case was assigned to Kelly a Trump appointee who has been on the federal bench just more than a year now. He was very inquisitive at Wednesday's hearing asking tough questions of both sides drilling particularly deep into some of CNN's arguments. Attorney Theodore Boutrous representing CNN in court called Trump's move to revoke Acosta's hard pass "the definition of arbitrariness and capriciousness.""What are the standards?" Boutrous asked. "Rudeness is not a standard. If it were no one could have gone to the press conference."Boutrous also commented that Trump is "the most aggressive dare I say rude person in the room" at press conferences.After Boutrous spoke Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that the Trump White House has the legal right to kick out any reporter at any time for any reason.Burnham who's been tasked with defending Trump was responding to a hypothetical from Kelly. Burnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's press pass if it didn't agree with their reporting. "As a matter of law... yes" he said.Burnham's comment in court made the stakes of CNN v. Trump crystal clear.On Thursday the White House Correspondents' Association asked to file an amicus brief backing up CNN's suit. In the brief lawyers for the association -- which represents the White House press corps -- write that the administration's stance is "wrong" and "dangerous.""Simply stated if the President were to have the absolute discretion to strip a correspondent of a hard pass the chilling effect would be severe and the First Amendment protections afforded journalists to gather and report news on the activities on the President would be largely eviscerated" the association says in the brief.More than a dozen major news outlets -- most of CNN's rivals -- have also filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting CNN's action.CNN's David Shortell contributed reporting. ,Business
 (CNN)From Elsa's magic in Frozen -- and those gigantic ice shards that rise from the stage -- to social media taking on a nearly principle role in Dear Evan Hansen the Great White Way produces some of Broadway's most elaborate and technical stage spectacles two times a day.But behind the stage it's a different scene: Directors and stage managers are still lugging around 10-pound production books filled with paper that's often swapped out for script and choreography changes especially during pre-production and previews. And when understudies and new ensemble members are added hours before the curtain raises -- some of whom have never seen that scene before -- there's a steep learning curve to teach it fast.Now backstage is catching up to the innovation we see in the seats.Several shows including Kinky Boots and Pretty Woman: The Musical are shifting to a paperless system that packs the script lyrics videos and costume and prop notes into one spot for the director crew and cast members.The productions are leaning on an app from startup ProductionPro which is already used at companies such as Walt Disney Studios to help produce film and TV shows. During a recent rehearsal of Pretty Woman: The Musical attended by a handful of reporters production stage manager Thomas Recktenwald ran lines with three cast members subbing in for an evening performance. Swiping through the ProductionPro app on an iPad Pro Recktenwald showed off recent changes made to the script. It had notes scribbled into the margins via an Apple Pencil and he tapped his way through videos that highlight blocking broken down scene by scene.On the choreography side the dance captain might show the newer actors or understudies how a scene may look when a palm tree crosses from side of the stage to another and where they'll need to stand nearby. For last minute changes productions like Pretty Woman are not only saving time but cutting down a significant amount of paper waste. Production associates typically sprint to copy machines to give the cast and crew a look at what's new. (On average the show changed about 30 pages a day during its 12-week pre-production period -- and about 50 people received those copies daily). But Recktenwald or director Jerry Mitchell now pushes the update to anyone who's been given a ProductionPro log-in."We've gone through pages and pages of paper that have been printed distributed multiple times a day and then recycled or discarded in the same day -- and even in the same hour -- to improve the show to what we see on stage today" he said.ProductionPro founder Alex Libby who started as a Broadway stage manager came up with the concept to simplify the process five years ago when he was a producer alongside director Stephen Daldry known for his work on The Crown and Billy Elliot on Broadway."We were working on a brand new show at his kitchen table in the Meatpacking District" Libby told reporters. "There was paper everywhere -- costume designs set designs and script pages constantly changing. He looked up from this mess and was like 'I need a way to see this almost like a musical score; where I can see the entire opus in one place. I need a window into the world that we're creating.'"Libby transitioned from the musical world to launch his own software company which now has 10 employees working out of its Brooklyn New York office. While ProductionPro is focused on rolling out the technology to even more shows on Broadway it's also currently being used by 400 US high schools working on theatrical productions.David McQueen research director at tech advisory firm ABI Research says the move to streamline large-scale productions to tablets makes sense."Tablets are gaining traction in many industries and businesses from education and healthcare to lawyers and restaurants so it is of no surprise that Broadway is also turning to them for ease of access to vast amounts of scripts and videos" he told CNN Business. He emphasized how tablets enable real-time long-distance sharing in a relatively easy-to-use form factor has broad appeal."And of course there are also the immediate benefits of reducing paper waste and literal storage space" he said. "Bye-bye filing cabinets." Or in Broadway's case farewell 10-pound production books.,Business
 (CNN)"Keep your elbows as close to your sides as possible" the personal trainer tells me as I start my last set of push-ups. My arms feel like they're about to buckle onto my hotel room floor but Mike pleads with me not to give up. "Only a few seconds left!" I can hear Mike cheering me on but I can't see him. In fact I've never even met the guy.I'm working out through Aaptiv an app with dozens of coaches who lead pre-recorded audio-only workouts. The app which costs $14.99/month or $99.99/year features a variety of beginner intermediate and advanced workouts. About 200000 users work out with Aaptiv and the startup is growing fast. Last week the company announced an international expansion of the English-language app to 20 countries and it plans to move into local languages in 2019.Aaptiv is valued at $200 million and is backed by investments from Amazon Disney Warner Music and Bose. But the industry is crowded: An endless amount of workout apps and YouTube videos target people who don't want to fork over the cash for a personal trainer. So Aaptiv hopes to stand out with its audio-only format. Founder and CEO Ethan Agarwal came up with the idea after identifying a need in his own workouts."I needed some kind of coaching that would work while I was running" Agarwal told CNN Business. "The problem with videos is that I can't run down the street staring at my phone. That's why I started Aaptiv."The app goes far beyond running: Courses are available for everything from yoga to strength training voiced by a coach with current music playing in the background. The routines are designed for different settings like the gym outdoors and home and some require equipment like weights or a treadmill while others need no props. The convenience and variety are big draws but Aaptiv's audio-only format poses a major challenge: Because users can't see the exercises they must rely solely on the trainer's verbal explanation to ensure they're doing the workout correctly.  I experienced this problem whenever I tried a new workout. I understood the vast majority of the exercises but about once a routine I would find I wasn't doing the movements the coach intended. And occasionally I was way off.Correct form for a workout is key to avoid injury noted Dr. Daniel Yadegar a cardiologist at Weill Cornell Medical College who also uses Aaptiv. But he added "there are many people who work out on their own at the gym without supervision who take a similar risk. If used properly and with consistency apps like this can be a great tool in achieving fitness goals."The app's "very vocal online community" in its 32000-strong Facebook page helps mitigate the risk of confusion and improper form Aaptiv trainer Ackeem Emmons told CNN Business."If one person has a question about a particular exercise then almost always lots of other users have the same question" Emmons said. "And that tells us how we need to improve."Users can also weigh in at the end of each exercise as the app prompts them to rate the workout and leave feedback for Aaptiv's trainers.Those 22 trainers -- five full-time employees and 17 contractors -- develop their workouts with a quality-control team and record the audio sessions in a New York recording studio. About 4000 personal trainers have applied for positions at Aaptiv said CEO Agarwal."I heard about Aaptiv from a friend and I thought these guys might put me out of business one day" said Emmons. "So instead of waiting for that to happen I applied to work with them." ,Business
London (CNN)When my Aunt Nicki visits me in London we avoid musical theater and the cinema. Aunt Nicki is hard of hearing. Although there are many enhanced listening devices available to help her such as an Assistive Living amplifier or a closed captioning screen that sits in a cup holder she tells me they don't work well enough.When I recently tried on the new "smart caption glasses" at the Royal National Theatre I had her on my mind. The theatre is testing a pilot program for the technology for all performances of Hadestown and War Horse through October. It plans to make the glasses available for all of its performances during the 2019 season.The headset manufactured by Epson in partnership with the Royal National Theater is heavier than normal reading glasses but much lighter than bulky virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift. The lenses look like a typical pair of glasses but they fit inside a large gray casing that sits on the sides of your head. When you look through the glasses closed captions scroll across the bottom of the augmented reality lenses. A handheld keypad is attached to the glasses via cable to allow each user to customize the color size and position of the closed captions. Changing the positioning of the text is key for user comfort. The biggest challenge is finding the sweet spot of balancing the captions in the foreground with the theater performance in the background. Here's how it works: The script from an opening-night production is fed into speech software which follows the performance and adjusts the captions accordingly. This process is refined using sound video and lighting cues.  "If a performer jumps a few lines the system will react" said Jonathan Suffolk the technical director for the National Theatre. "It will take a second or two but the system will react and it will recognize where it is."Suffolk said some hard of hearing users wear it so they can read lips at the same time as reading the captions. The glasses are free for attendees and available at every performance. It's a major improvement on existing open captioning which unlike closed captioning are always in view. This typically includes large screens displaying captions."The response has been overwhelmingly positive for deaf theatre-goers who would like to come into the theatre anytime they want" Suffolk said of its recent trial. "It's really fundamental that organizations like the National Theatre -- in its really privileged position -- does this type of work for the entire sector."Richard France -- who works for a group called Deafinitely Theatre which creates performances for both the deaf and hearing communities -- has worked with many different technologies but calls the smart glasses a potential game changer. "I'm used to going to the theater with captions in it but it's much more enjoyable with the glasses because I can follow the movement of the actors on the stage and they feel is more inclusive" France said.The technology has been successfully used in US movie theaters but the National Theatre's challenges are greater because their performances are live.Advocates for the deaf caution there's no single device or system that will work for all members of the deaf community but say the availability of this type of device at every National Theatre performance is as much a game changer as the actual technology. Sarina Roffé the former president of the National Cued Speech Association believes it's a solid step toward making live performances more inclusive."This new technology allows the deaf and hard of hearing to have complete access" Roffé said. "It's really amazing how far we've advanced and how it has positively affected the quality of life for people who are deaf and hard of hearing."So perhaps the next time Aunt Nicki comes to London we'll be able to catch a show together.

New York (CNN)Inside WeWork's New York City headquarters on a Thursday morning a handful of kids are selling radishes kale and peppers.The children are "members" of WeWork's first school WeGrow where farming and agriculture is part of the curriculum. They are interacting with WeGrow employees browsing the goods: "How many cucumbers would you like?" one girl asks. "We take Apple Pay" another shouts. The older kids ages 5 to 9 picked the crops the day before during their weekly jaunt an hour away to a farm owned by WeWork cofounder and CEO Adam Neumann and Rebekah Neumann chief brand officer and founding partner at WeWork. Rebekah Neumann is also WeGrow's founder and CEO.WeGrow is WeWork's newest endeavor and its first foray into education. WeWork founded in 2010 has made a name for itself as a global network of coworking spaces charging customers more than $1000 a month for space at its buildings that span more than 20 countries. The company has already raised billions of dollars in funding and is reportedly in talks to raise another round which could value it at $35 billion. Its selling point is "community" and it has taken a heavy handed approach to determining what that should look like: It recently issued a company-wide meat ban citing environmental concerns.WeGrow which calls itself a "conscious entrepreneurial" school is inspired by the Montessori approach to learning that gives children the freedom to discover and choose their activities so their creativity and curious nature is preserved. But the goal is not to create next-generation startup CEOs."Entrepreneurial is a bit of a trigger word for people" said Rebekah Neumann. "[We've] seen children do these things forever -- every time they've been running a lemonade stand that's what that is."WeGrow opened its doors this fall after launching a pilot program last year. Currently 46 kids are enrolled in classes from pre-Kindergarten to fourth grade. The private school costs between $36000 to $42000 depending on the age of your child but 60% of its students are receiving some type of financial aid paid for by WeWork. WeGrow works with School and Student Services to access a family's financials and determine aid amounts.The kids start every morning with live music followed by yoga and meditation. They spend time in nature and opt to take either Hebrew or Mandarin courses. WeGrow students learn science math social studies and language arts. The company has yet to determine what type of standardized tests it will incorporate to benchmark their progress.It also has a built-in mentorship program for kids to connect with WeWork community members with careers in areas kids might be interested in. Only about one-third of the students are children of WeWork employees or members but Rebekah Neumann sees WeGrow as a way to bring its employees and their families closer together. She also calls it a key part of WeWork's ambitious core goals. "We want to make a world where people can work to make a life and not just a living but that's part of a larger more holistic mission to elevate the world's consciousness to create a world where people are happy and fulfilled and living in a sharing state" Rebekah Neumann told CNN Business.When the Neumanns started to have kids -- now they have five -- Rebekah said it became clear how important it is to teach these values at a young age."[WeGrow is] not really a departure from the [WeWork] mission at all even though on the surface I can understand that it might look like that." In recent years WeWork opened a gym turned a Wall Street mailroom into a public speakeasy bar and acquired companies including community platform Meetup.com. It also bought Lord & Taylor's iconic department store on Fifth Avenue for $850 million to serve as its new headquarters. Despite its growth the company is still trying to appropriately set its own culture.The Neumanns aren't alone in trying to reinvent education with the help of some venture capital.The Alt School founded by former Google employee Max Antilla in 2014 is backed by powerful investors such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. Its selling point is personalized education by merging technology with learning to understand and tailor to the needs of each child. It raised more than $130 million in venture capital and opened nearly a dozen schools in California and New York. But over the past year Alt School shuttered some of its locations and refocused on selling its software to schools a potentially more profitable endeavor.According to Larry Cuban professor emeritus of education at Stanford University businesses -- even those with the best intentions -- have to make money. "Alt School retrenching cutting back closing their school in Palo Alto and disappointing those parents who send their kids there is one example" Cuban told CNN Business. Although WeGrow is able to get off the ground with the help of its parent company it is optimistic about its future as a profitable endeavor."It will eventually be able to sustain independently for sure" said Neumann who hopes WeGrow will some day exist in every city WeWork operates in. "We're going to take it one step at a time right now." ,Business
 (CNN Business)Food halls are the promised land for intrepid as well as indecisive diners. Slurp up soup dumplings here; grab a bánh mì sandwich there; munch on a fish taco elsewhere. Finish up with a mango mochidoki -- and return the next day for an entirely different menu. For the business traveler food hall dining is a boon. Meals are typically affordable so it's a perfect way to stretch your per diem allowance. And the spaces offer an antidote to on-the-road loneliness: You never know who you'll connect with at a communal table -- and there are no reservations required.Food halls are also a great way to get a taste of a new city when you don't have much time to explore. You'll typically find them in aging and underutilized urban spaces active transportation hubs and outdated factories. Prime locations offer a  "balance between a place with foot traffic and a destination" says Peter DiPrinzio director of operations at R. House a food hall in Baltimore. Toque on ThisThe food options can be as elevated as an expense-account restaurant. "Having multiple chefs under the same roof allows us to bounce creative ideas off each other and elevate our craft" says Lindsey Blankenhorn of Carroll's Kitchen a non-profit stall in Raleigh's Morgan Street Food Hall dedicated to ending homelessness for women by providing hands-on training. Carroll's Kitchen's best seller is kolache a filled sweet roll that originated in Central Europe.While most food halls present a wide variety of cuisines a few focus on food from one region. Eataly for one now has 40 worldwide outposts of its Italian-themed hall.  Honolulu's Shirokiya Japan Village Walk evokes Old Kyoto and offers a panoply of Japanese favorites from sushi and ramen to tonkatsu and wagyu steak.Mercado Little Spain a collaboration between José Andrés and brothers Ferran and Albert Adrià will offer traditional and creative tastes of Spain when it opens next year in New York's Hudson Yards.Tomorrow's SpecialsFood halls frequently evolve so you may find new selections if you return on your next trip. In Denver's Zeppelin Station the No Vacancy stall features a series of chefs to keep patrons from getting bored. One stall at Birmingham's Pizitz Food Hall operates like a pop-up changing quarterly so there's always something different to try. Traveling to a location beyond the city center? Food halls are migrating to the suburbs and spreading inland. And soon you may enjoy fare from a food hall from the comfort of your hotel room since more and more are offering delivery service.

New York (CNN Business)Amazon has made this much clear: It will finish its search for a second headquarters by the end of the year. Beyond that a lot is TBD.The company sent cities across North America into a frenzy last year when it announced its search. Dubbed HQ2 the new facility — or facilities — will cost at least $5 billion to construct and will create as many as 50000 high-paying jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. Employees at Amazon's (AMZN) main campus in Seattle will be offered the chance to relocate.The company has narrowed 238 proposals down to 20 finalists and executives have traveled across the United States and to one Canadian city to survey sites for Amazon's new home. But as the company provides few updates theories and leaks about which city will be crowned winner continue to swirl — and this week has brought a fresh flurry of news.On Monday night The New York Times reported that Amazon is close to a deal to split HQ2 between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens New York and the Crystal City area of Arlington Virginia.Long Island City is one of four areas that New York City proposed in its bid for the Amazon project. The others were Midtown West the Brooklyn Tech Triangle and Lower Manhattan.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Monday that Amazon plans to divide its second headquarters evenly between two cities instead of picking one winner. According to the Journal's sources the rationale behind selecting two cities is to recruit enough technical talent.Amazon declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report and didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the New York Times report.Here's what we know about where HQ2 plans stand.What qualities is Amazon seeking for HQ2?The expected 50000 people who will eventually work at the new headquarters will bring a huge economic boost to the winning city — or cities. The fact that the jobs pay well makes the opportunity even more attractive.But the cities must have certain attributes. In its request for proposals Amazon outlined several criteria for HQ2 such as proximity to a major airport and the ability to attract technical talent. It must be a suburban or urban area with more than 1 million people. Amazon also said it was looking for communities that offer a "stable and business-friendly" environment and access to mass transit. Which cities are still in the running and who are the top contenders?Depends on who you ask.Amazon announced a list of 20 finalists for HQ2 in January including: Atlanta; Austin; Boston; Chicago; Columbus Ohio; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Los Angeles; Miami; Montgomery County Maryland; Nashville; Newark; New York City; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh; Toronto; and Washington DC.Over the past weekend The Washington Post reported that Northern Virginia's Crystal City was in advanced talks with Amazon for the second headquarters. On Sunday the Journal said not only Crystal City but also Dallas and New York City were in late-stage discussions with the company. According to the Journal's sources talks with other cities — such as Denver Toronto and Nashville — appear to have fizzled out.An Amazon executive took a swipe at the Washington Post report on Saturday. "Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City VA as #HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City VA any favors. And stop treating the NDA you signed like a used napkin" tweeted Mike Grella Amazon's Director of Economic Development.Grella leads economic development for Amazon Web Services and has not been involved at all in the HQ2 search a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. Meanwhile the Washington DC metro area has been considered a favorite for the site. It's the only region with three finalists on the short list and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post and has a home in the nation's capital. Representatives for cities such as Dallas Crystal City Austin and Philadelphia declined to comment to CNN Business while others did not respond to requests for comment. What are cities offering Amazon?Some cities got creative with their offers. Stonecrest Georgia — which is still in the running as part of Atlanta's bid — offered to turn over some of its land and rename it the city of Amazon. But on the whole finalists took varying approaches to releasing their proposals to the public. Toronto the only Canadian city on the short list posted its entire bid online without redactions. The city touted its diverse technical talent universal health care and welcoming immigration system. It also proposed real estate sites for the facility. Others have gone public with big tax incentives. Maryland approved $8.5 billion in incentives to Amazon — the largest known package. Not far behind is Newark New Jersey which announced $7 billion in incentives to attract the company.But many cities released blacked-out versions of their bids or refused to make any part of their proposals public. Philadelphia released a heavily redacted proposal that included information about possible sites and its talent pool but blocked out details about incentives. Where are we in the decision-making process and when will Amazon make a final announcement?Amazon is famously secretive so it's no surprise the company has largely remained mum throughout the HQ2 process. Since announcing its short list in January Amazon has given virtually no public updates beyond reiterating that a decision would be made this year. According to a source familiar with the search Amazon wrapped up visits to all 20 finalists this summer. When touring cities Amazon representatives met with local business leaders and saw potential real estate sites. Following those visits Amazon asked the finalists for a comprehensive request for information — a standard document for economic development projects — containing a variety of questions about talent real estate regulations and more. In recent months the company also reportedly revisited some of the bigger cities such as Miami Chicago and New York City according to the Wall Street Journal.

It was the middle of the night and Ayal Lanternari was rushing to warm up refrigerated breast milk for his three-month-old baby.His son Daniel was hungry and there was nothing Lanternari could do to speed up the process. The only safe way to heat up cold or frozen breast milk is by putting it under running warm water or in a bowl of warm water — a process that can take 10 minutes or more."You can't microwave breast milk or heat it directly on the stove because it will damage the nutrients and the immunological property in the milk" says Lanternari a biomedical engineer.But like most new parents he was tired and frustrated and thought there had to be a better way. That's when he got an idea: What if he designed a baby bottle that spread out the breast milk into a thinner layer? Doing that would expand the liquid's surface area allowing it to warm up faster without damaging the nutrients."The bottle kind of designed itself in my head" said Lanternari.Instead of a typical cylindrical shape the bottle he envisioned was round "similar to the shape of a breast" he said. Later that same day Lanternari called his best friend Asaf Kehat and told him about it. "My first reaction was there was something so simple and genius about it. It was an obvious solution" says Kehat who is also a biomedical engineer. "I researched the baby bottle market and couldn't find anything like what Ayal had thought of."The two joined forces and spent almost a year conducting research and working on the design. Then in February 2013 their company Nanobébé was born. The birth of a product line It would take several years before the two could bring their product to market.Lanternari and Kehat who were living in Israel at the time spent the next five years on research and development testing their bottle with hundreds of parents infants lactation consultants and pediatricians."This wasn't just another product. Babies were going to use it. So we had to be very careful" says Kehat. Besides the efficacy of it they designed the bottle with a modern stylish look and made it easy for babies to hold.Testing by the company's own R&D team as well as certified lactation consultants and medical professionals showed their bottle cut the milk's warming time by more than half to about three to five minutes. Conversely the bottle's circular shape also cooled breast milk twice as fast as a conventional bottle says Lantenari.In February the company unveiled a stackable feeding bottle selling it online at Babies 'R' Us and at Buy Buy Baby stores across the US. (Babies 'R' Us went out of business a few months later as part of Toys R Us' bankruptcy)Lanternari and Kehat opened a US office in Charleston South Carolina earlier this month.The two entrepreneurs picked Charleston because it was ideally suited as a distribution hub for both domestic and overseas customers. Lanternari who recently moved to Charleston with his wife and three young children says the city also has a strong pipeline of available skilled workers in the health care and business development arenas. But the company's headquarters remains in Tel Aviv where all of the products are made. Kehat has stayed in Israel to oversee those operations.Although Nanobébé started with a baby bottle the company has evolved into a whole ecosystem of products including breast milk bottles breast milk storage bags for the fridge and freezer a microwave steam sterilizer unit drying rack pacifiers and warming bowl for the bottles."All of the related products like the stackable breast milk freezer bags and drying tray carry the Nanobébé DNA of functionality and innovation" says Lanternari. The bottles feature a hollow center which makes them stackable. The freezer bags can also be stored horizontally on top of each other to save space. And the bottles come with an adapter to attach them to a variety of breast pumps.So far the products have been a hit. "We sold out of our products twice in the first month at Babies 'R' Us" says Lanternari. Although the retailers' bankruptcy was a setback for the fledgling business other national retailers have since picked up the brand including Target and Wal-Mart. Nanobébé products are in 170 Target stores so far he says. In January the brand will roll out in 1215 Wal-Mart stores.Best friends since childhoodLanternari and Kehat grew up together in Israel and have led parallel lives."We've known each other since we were five years old and have been best friends ever since" says Lanternari. "We are brothers."Both are 39. Their parents were neighbors. They were classmates in school and went to the same university — Israel's Technion Institute of Technology — and pursued the same major. After graduating Kehat joined medical device maker Mazor Robotics where he was a clinical and sales manager for several years. Lanternari started his career as an engineer with Novocure an oncology company that develops treatments for patients with solid tumors. He later worked for a company that managed engineering and infrastructure projects.Both men left their jobs in 2013 to focus on Nanobébé. At the outset they personally invested "hundred of thousands" of dollars of their own savings. But eventually they sought funding.To date the business has raised several million dollars from Israeli venture capital firms and InterTech Group a privately-held holding company.Nanobébé now employs 30 people and its bottle has won a number of industry awards including TTPM [Toys Tots Pets & Mom] Best of Baby Award for 2018. While the recognition is welcome Kehat said the company's mission is to keep the products affordable for parents. Prices range from $22.99 for a 3-pack of bottles to $49.99 for a "starter pack" with four bottles two pacifiers and a bottle warming bowl.As the company expands sales globally — the brand is also available in Israel France Belgium and Canada — Kehat says Nanobébé's team is working ahead on other innovative products."To get this kind of pickup for our first product in our launch year was completely unexpected" says Kehat adding that sales in just the first few months are "going amazing.""Our innovation isn't just for babies" he says. "It's for everyone's benefit — moms dads and caregivers." ,Business
Bedford New HampshireRoger Brown still remembers the shocked looks people gave him the first time he rode a Segway through the halls of the company's New Hampshire headquarters.It was early 2013 a rough time for the startup and its aspirations of changing how the world gets around. Brown had bought the company for just $9 million a few weeks before and flown in from his home in Tennessee to begin turning things around. What better way to get a sense of the place than to zip about on its signature product?As Brown cruised the halls on the self-balancing two-wheeled scooter an employee pulled him aside to lecture him on the risks of riding without a helmet. Brown was dumbfounded. "I own the company" he told the employee. "I can do it." With that he whizzed away. A few hours later he received an email outlining the company's safety policies which included mandatory helmet use. Either Brown would change his ways or he'd be written up. All these years later he still finds it more than a bit silly. "You would've thought I went to the Baptist convention and walked around with a pro-abortion sign" he said recently.The fuss over a helmet was the least of Brown's problems. He was the third person to own Segway which had grabbed headlines in 2001 with the Segway PT and a promise to supplant the automobile and reinvent transportation. Instead the company's flagship product became a punchline and the company a mess. In the years before Brown bought Segway a half-dozen CEOs had come and gone many of its best engineers had defected and the VCs who had once showered Segway in cash had moved on to the next big thing.Brown bought the company from the estate of Jimi Heselden a British entrepreneur who died after riding his Segway off a cliff. Segway was barely getting by on the meager revenue it brought in selling the PT to tour companies security companies and police departments. But Brown saw a global brand with a powerful distribution channel. Six million tourists rode Segways on tours of cities like San Francisco and Washington DC each year. He planned to buy other transportation companies focused on short trips like e-bike startups. All he had to do to make Segway profitable he figured was run the place well.Brown brought on new employees to change Segway's uptight culture. He led an effort to trim costs by reengineering a circuit board ditching the PT's expensive gyroscope in favor of a cheaper solution and negotiating a better battery contract. It worked. Segway turned a profit within a year of Brown's arrival. He sold the company to the Chinese firm Ninebot on April 1 2015 for more than $75 million.For a time he was happy. Then one day in August of this year he got lunch at the Boathouse a barbecue joint in Cincinnati. As he ate wings and pulled pork sliders Brown noticed people riding scooters along the riverwalk outside and not just any scooters: Segway scooters.Ninebot introduced the Segway scooters shortly after Brown cashed out triggering the scooter-sharing craze that has swept the world in the last year. You can find Ninebot's scooters in more than 100 cities from the Americas to Asia Europe and Australia. Ninebot can barely keep up. The company which has more than 1000 employees will ship more than one million scooters this year — 10 times the number of PTs Segway sold in its first 17 years. Silicon Valley-backed Bird and Lime both of which launched in 2017 lead the trend. They're growing faster than the ridesharing leaders Uber and Lyft did in their early days. Uber and Lyft have responded by launching their own scooter services this fall. So has Ford. All rely on Ninebot scooters. "If I would've had the vision of Bird or Lime" Brown said "Segway would have been worth $10 billion."When Brown owned the company he focused on the Segway PT which cost thousands of dollars. It had always been too expensive and ahead of its time. Now though the urban transportation revolution that Segway founder Dean Kamen and his truly gifted engineers dreamed of is unfolding even if they aren't a part of it. Many are thrilled."We knew this was the way future transportation products would work" said former Segway lead engineer Doug Field who has since worked at Apple and Tesla. "Anyone standing on something that's powered by electricity and a computer is a Segway descendant." The next big thingKamen is a colorful character even among techies. He dropped out of college. He flies about in his own helicopter. He owns an island off the coast of Connecticut and has joked about founding his own nation.He's also one hell of an inventor. Kamen made his name developing medical devices such as a portable insulin pump and heart stents. In the 1990s he built a self-balancing wheelchair so the disabled could be at eye level with anyone. Even as he worked on medical devices Kamen pondered the future of urban transportation. He didn't see a place for automobiles in that future and liked to say you don't need a 4000-pound vehicle to move a 150-pound person one mile. After finishing the wheelchair developing an entirely new mode of transportation was the obvious next step.Kamen met Field in the mid-1990s when Field was working at Johnson & Johnson one of Kamen's business partners. Kamen found himself struck by Field's intelligence.Field for his part seemed destined to revolutionize transport. His mother wrote in his baby book that her son would one day work on stuff with wheels. Kamen's vision of moving people about on small electric machines enticed Field who had started his career developing vehicles at Ford. He found the challenge of developing self-balancing technology irresistible.At Segway Field earned a reputation as a brilliant engineer and calm leader who listened to everyone didn't micromanage and was beloved by all. "You got the impression he was searching for perfection among leadership team-building" said Jason Sachs an early Segway employee. "His character and manner made people trust him."The world got its first glimpse of the Segway PT — Personal Transporter — on Good Morning America on December 3 2001. It was in a word a sensation. Few products have enjoyed such hype. John Doerr an early investor in Google and Amazon predicted it would be bigger than the internet and that it would achieve $1 billion in revenue faster than any product in history. Hype aside the PT was an impressive gadget. Gyroscopes allowed it to balance perfectly on two wheels. Instead of using handlebars or a steering wheel riders shifted their weight to turn. It marked the first consumer application of drive-by-wire technology in which software not mechanical linkages makes a machine turn accelerate and stop. Riders zipped along at up to 12.5 mph for as much as 12 miles on a single charge.The PT was truly innovative even revolutionary. Kamen who had spent parts of about six years developing the PT spoke seriously of rendering cars obsolete. His employees talked about working with urban planners in China to design new cities around their two-wheeled transport."There was a lot of reference to drinking the Kool-Aid" said early Segway employee Matt Gelbwaks. "We're here to change the world. It's bigger than us. It's bigger than us individually it's even bigger than us collectively."Things didn't quite work out that way. Although brilliantly designed and meticulously built two significant drawbacks hobbled the PT: It cost $4950 and it was hard to look like anything other than a nerd riding one. It became a punchline and then a trope as a prop in television shows like "Arrested Development" and movies like "Mall Cop." It didn't help that guys like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak took to playing polo with them and that President George W. Bush fell off of one in 2003.That same year Gelbwaks launched an experiment in Celebration Florida to see how people used the scooters. The company sold them at a deep discount to roughly 100 residents. Within a year nearly all of the participants had stopped riding their Segways. Why?"There was a significant dork factor" Gelbwaks says. "It was never truly socially accepted."Cash crunchThe experiment in Florida highlighted another problem: Segway developed and tested the PT under the greatest secrecy. The company worried a competitor might beat it to market and suspected Japanese automakers were working on a similar device. Employees kept the shades drawn. In some cases they sealed the blinds with tape lest someone try to peek through the narrow gap between the blind and window frame. They hid the scooters in plywood crates before transporting them. But working this way kept Segway from figuring out what people might want or need in a scooter."How do you do product testing if you can't go outside?" said Jonathan Pompa an early Segway engineer. "It worked really well at driving around an engineering office because that's what we were doing with it instead of driving around in a city."Kamen's singular focus on the PT created another problem: Although Segway built prototypes of electric bikes four-wheelers skateboards and even a unicycle — many of which Ninebot its eventual owner currently offers — it never commercialized them. It couldn't because it didn't have the money.Segway struggled to bring the price of the PT down to a consumer-friendly $1000. The cost of its nickel metal hydride battery made that impossible. Manufacturing in New Hampshire rather than China didn't help. Despite the company's best efforts the PT remained frightfully expensive."Five or six grand for one of these things was crazy" said Klee Kleber Segway's vice president of marketing from 2004-07. "The price was way out of whack."You won't get any argument from Jim Norrod the company's CEO from 2005 until 2009."A lot of people said our products were too expensive they were too high-priced. Yeah they were" Norrod said. "You know why? I needed the money to run the company."Beyond the exorbitant cost the world was not ready for electric vehicles. Oh sure there were plenty of wealthy techies for whom it was a fun toy and Segway was able to experiment with rental programs and even to explore a partnership with Zipcar the car-sharing outfit. But it lacked the infrastructure needed to truly transform transportation. Plus buying one was a headache. The first customers had to travel to regional training centers for lessons. And once you bought one there was no clear place to ride it. A lot of people didn't want them on sidewalks. Unlike the ride-hailing and scooter startups of today the company spent years working within the system to win friends and change rules."Did we need to pass a law in Mississippi? Did we need to pass a law in North Dakota? No" said Matt Dailida who led a nationwide push to make Segways on sidewalks legal. "But it was a fundamental belief at the company's highest levels that we wanted to be engaging public officials and get their buy-in and excitement."Norrod was doing everything he could to rein in costs and keep Segway afloat when General Motors threw him a lifeline in 2007. The two companies started developing the EN-V a pod-shaped lightweight electric vehicle concept that GM would unveil three years later at Expo 2010 in Shanghai.Just as things looked up though the financial crisis hit."I'm sitting there with no ability to bring money in" he said. "Venture capitalists are basically cutting out their non-profitable businesses. The stock market craters. That's what I'm staring at and saying 'what am I going to do?' I had to find any deal that was going to work." GM seemed like an obvious buyer. Together they could commercialize the EN-V and fulfill the long-delayed Segway vision of post-car urban transportation. GM's bankruptcy dashed those hopes. Instead Norrod engineered a sale to Heselden the British entrepreneur. When he died Brown took over.When Segway met NinebotIn 2014 Segway convinced the US International Trade Commission to investigate infringements of Segway's patents for its self-balancing technology. One of the companies listed in Segway's complaint was Ninebot which quickly offered to buy the company. Ninebot saw a company that shared its vision of improving urban transport. It also saw a company with tremendous brand recognition. And it knew it would need Segway's patents to enter the US market. The two sides quickly closed the deal which was announced April 15 2015.Ninebot began almost immediately to sell a series of Segway branded scooters and other products priced at $1000 or less. They've sold far faster than the Segway PT ever did and were exactly the kind of affordable options Kleber the former VP of marketing envisioned. "Segway now is sort of where I thought we should've been 10 years ago" Kleber said.The golden age of electric transportationFifteen years after Kamen introduced the world to an electric vehicle the world was finally ready for them. By 2017 the sharing and gig economies were in full swing two things essential to the success of companies like Lime and Bird. People think nothing of sharing rather than owning things these days and a ready supply of independent contractors makes charging and repairing scooters far easier — and cheaper. It also helped that smartphones which make it a breeze to unlock a scooter and pay for a ride are ubiquitous. And the ever-growing number of bike lanes in urban centers provides a place to ride safely.The business attitude has shifted too. Segway's attempts at working with cities gave way to a more aggressive attitude of barging into a city with a few hundred scooters setting up shop and dealing with city officials later. The tactic rarely wins friends in government but has allowed Bird and Lime to grow rapidly."At Segway we tried to do it the right way and it was a nightmare" Kleber said. "So I kind of actually respect the fact that they're just blowing in and dumping the scooters in the street and letting it sort itself out." Scooter startups also follow the Silicon Valley ethos of iterate iterate iterate which runs counter to Segway's perfectionism. The startups favor cheap scooters — they typically cost just a few hundred bucks — that were never designed for the rigors of heavy use and adverse weather. But why worry about such things when scooters are essentially commodities easily replaced when they inevitably break or get thrown into trees rivers or San Francisco Bay? Bird Lime and all their competitors prefer to move fast learn from mistakes solicit customer feedback and then introduce improvements like bigger batteries.The success of these companies draws mixed emotions from Segway veterans but the most common feeling among the 20 former employees who spoke to CNN Business was excitement. Lightweight electric vehicles long ridiculed as an expensive toy for nerds are finally getting their due."I love it" Pompa said. "It's a transportation niche that hasn't been properly addressed."Yet some worry the current growth trajectory cannot continue and that scooter startups run the risk of litigation and even financial ruin if they don't get serious about safety. People regularly ride without helmets (often in violation of local ordinances or state laws) zip through traffic or along sidewalks indiscriminately and sometimes ride two-to-a-scooter. Two riders have died on the scooters this year."If you want to make this sustainable for a long time significantly more thought should be put into this" said Stephan de Penasse one of Segway's first employees. "Everyone's in for a fast buck." Segway's delayed victorySegway's office in Bedford New Hampshire is a quiet place. It focuses on the Segway PT and the market for it is shrinking according to Ninebot. As a result there were layoffs earlier this year. When CNN Business visited in September an area once used for testing the Segway PT had given way to palettes of scooters fresh from China. Most of the R&D and manufacturing has moved to a bustling building outside Beijing. Still employees feel a tremendous sense of pride in what they've accomplished."People like to say Segway was a flop but we're still here" said Roxanne Lamonde a 12-year-veteran of Segway and its director of risk management and human resources. "There aren't many startups that started when we did and are still around."Many employees believe the popularity of scooters and success of companies like Lime and Bird vindicates Kamen's vision of personalized electric transportation. "If Segway was a piece of leading to that vision of getting around congested cities easier I guess I'm pretty proud of that" former employee Chip MacDonald said. "I just wish I could've been able to profit from it."As for Kamen he believes the scooter boom confirms his ideas about the future of transportation. But he isn't terribly interested in talking about it and wonders why the media would be. He considers the Segway a footnote to his career something of far less import than the advances he pioneered in insulin pumps and dialysis machines or the students he's encouraged through his nonprofit FIRST to pursue engineering.These days Kamen is far more excited about his latest venture the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute which explores ways of regenerating human organs. He mentions this to me as he is driving home from a speech in Boston where he'd gone to recruit employees (he's hired 60 engineers in the past two months alone). As usual he was introduced to the audience as the inventor of the Segway."It's been 20 years" he said. "No matter what else I do in life I'm the Segway guy."People usually praise the Segway and Kamen's efforts to remake transportation. But occasionally someone will ask if Kamen considers it a failure. When that happens he often thinks of the Wright Brothers."They certainly weren't giving out frequent flyer miles by 1920" he said. "But I don't think anybody would say 'Hey Wilbur hey Orville how do you feel about that failure?'"And in the emerging world of micromobility a catch-all term for small computerized electric vehicles Kamen is a visionary with a place in history."A lot of people laughed at him when the Segway was released or failed" said Sanjay Dastoor CEO of Skip a scooter-sharing company. "I always thought it was a shame for that to be people's first reaction. He had an amazing career and really Dean was right.",Business
The demand for living small is getting bigger. More than half of Americans would consider living in a home that's less than 600 square feet according to a survey done by the National Association of Home Builders. And among Millennials interest increases to 63%.  "Tiny is inevitable" says Soren Rose founder of Klein which in 2017 began seeking out renowned architects to design tiny prefab homes.While tiny homes are attractive and novel there are some design and logistical challenges. Rose says that it will take the combination of form function and freedom for tiny to take off on a wider scale. "You see these amazing tiny houses in magazines and on television programs but you can't really buy them" says Rose. "Architects did it for themselves to prove how they can make a gem. So we thought: Why don't we work with the world's best architects on this? And make them available to everyone."David Latimer a tiny home designer and owner of New Frontier Tiny Homes in Nashville says the challenges to wider acceptance of tiny homes is also procedural. Consumer financing and zoning regulations are holding the industry back he says. "Government and financing regulation changes move slower than molasses running up hill in Antarctica."But with some design enhancements and evolutions in financing and zoning the tipping point to a wider acceptance of tiny living may be coming. Architect designedThe first architect that Klein asked to design a tiny house that could be mass-produced was Denmark's Bjarke Ingels. The A45 house he and his firm Bjarke Ingels Group designed is an enhanced A-frame style in a prismatic shape with a square footprint. If you imagine taking a cube and pushing two opposite corners down to the ground that is the shape of the house. The shape gives the interior a more grandiose feel with full 16-foot height on both sides of the structure.The 150-square-foot home is a low-impact off-the-grid structure made of wood glass and canvas that can be carried into remote areas and constructed by hand."You can see it as a surf cottage on Montauk or tucked up in the mountains" says Rose.Klein is taking pre-orders for the home now with anticipated delivery in the first quarter of 2019. The company's goal is to keep it under $100000 for the full structure including interior finishes. (Permitting and clearing of the land are extra.) But this house is only the first of six homes each designed by a different architect and exploring a full circle of tiny home concepts. One will be the biggest home that can be hauled by a semi-truck. Another will be a mobile tiny house. The company is even exploring a tiny home that can be taken down and put up again.The next home Klein will introduce will be modular.  "There will be A B and C modules and you can put them together in many possible ways" says Rose. "It has the diversity to be everything from a music studio to an extra cottage to a bigger tiny home for a family. You can customize your home to your life." Downsize and upgradeMoving from a full-sized home to a tiny home can be an adjustment. No one wants to feel like they are living in "less."That's why Latimer intentionally designs his homes with full-sized fixtures and appliances high-end finishes and the kind of craftsmanship you'd find in a custom home."Downsize and upgrade" says Latimer. "Every room in my homes feels full size. A lot of natural light. Full-size range. King-size beds. Oven. Big sinks."This is in keeping with the tiny home idea of scaling back and having more."The new status symbol is cultivating a life of experience" says Latimer. "It is about experiences not stuff. And small spaces allow us to do that. People are looking for smaller mortgages smaller time lines. With more time and money for other things."Evolved zoning and financingA source of frustration for those who want to live tiny is a lack of easy paths to rezoning for tiny homes and access to consumer financing products.Zoning laws are local and specific making large-scale sales of these homes harder. In many places there are zoning laws that have minimum lot size requirements. This doesn't prohibit tiny homes but makes them very expensive given the cost of land. Some communities prohibit additional structures on a property.If the home is on wheels a buyer cannot easily secure traditional financing.But these regulations are evolving. Slowly. A newly updated building code relaxes certain requirements for tiny homes like the ceiling height and staircase specifications according to the National Association of Home Builders."The future for residential housing has to change" says Latimer. "It is an idea whose time has come." Tiny houses on wheels will continue to have useful applications but the increasing demand for mass market tiny homes on a foundation will help to grow an industry and a community-based movement Latimer says."We're not talking about putting spaceships on land next to anyone's house" says Latimer. "It is a home it just a little smaller. The bar can be shifted from a governmental standpoint because this is an option people want.",Business
It's nerve-wracking enough to ask your boss for a raise. But what if you had to take your request to coworkers instead?When it comes to pay raises and new hires at travel insurance comparison website Squaremouth the decision is done by a group vote.The company which has been doing peer-reviewed raises and hiring from its inception in 2003 and posts everyone's salary internally says it's all about transparency."Everyone knows everything" said CEO Chris Harvey. The company also posts sales and customer figures on its website for everyone to see. When employees feel they deserve a raise they can call a meeting with their colleagues to make their case. Employees usually have until the end of the day to make their final decision and must give an explanation of their votes which are not anonymous. An employee needs a majority to get their raise and all votes are equally weighted."There is no stopgap" said Harvey. "We rely on everyone having enough information and being intelligent enough that they will vote for an acceptable raise."Along with the peer-voted raises all employees automatically receive an annual cost of living raise every year that varies based on inflation. In January all employees were given a 2.1% salary raise. Megan Moncrief has been working at Squaremouth since 2013 and has received three raises through peer vote. Her first request was for a 22% raise."I will absolutely never forget it" the marketing and sales director said of her first raise request which was approved.Once the decision has been made the requester receives comments from their colleagues. "You get a document full of people's feedback about your contributions in general and what you bring to the table on a daily basis and that eliminates anyone from saying 'no' for a personal reason" Moncrief said. Since 2010 there have been 41 raise requests and 39 have been approved. Sometimes a smaller than requested raise has been approved. As the company has grown the company has tweaked the process to shrink the voting pool by office so employees are pitching to a more targeted audience. Squaremouth has two offices: Most of the software developers work out of the Fort Wayne Indiana office while the rest of the company including sales and marketing is in St. Petersburg Florida. The technology workers in Indiana vote as a group while the Florida office pitches to each other. The company introduced merit-based raises in 2015 that come directly from managers. These increases are mostly used if an employee gets a promotion or changes positions within the company.  They tend to be smaller than the peer requested raises."The group requests are supposed to be for the bigger jumps" said Moncrief.  In addition to her three peer-voted raises Moncrief also received two merit-based raises in her five years at the company and has more than doubled her salary. Squaremouth employees get a taste for the open culture during the hiring process a decision that is also done by a group. "When you interview you become aware of this process and I really liked the idea of it" said Moncrief. She said raise requests at her previous employer would get jammed up due to bureaucratic roadblocks. "I remember my boss telling me he wanted to pay me more but he got hit with so much red tape. All that is eliminated here."The company claims its "nothing to hide" philosophy creates trust among employees and management. It's common for Squaremouth to get around 300-400 applications for each open position according to Harvey but the number has slowed a little recently.The company also offers perks like unlimited paid time off (with a 10-day minimum) a $200 bonus on your birthday and free beer on tap in the office. But not every worker is cut out for such an open community. "If you come from an environment where you had to jump over someone who is failing in order to get ahead rather than help you are going to have a hard time at Squaremouth" said Harvey.,Business
Many of us spend more time with our coworkers than we do with our family members. But that doesn't mean we like them. Sometimes personalities clash work approaches differ and management tactics don't jibe. And even if you love your job not getting along with your colleagues can make you dread going to work. "Your success really largely depends on your ability to have a productive relationship with your colleagues" said Lynn Taylor a workplace expert and author of "Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant."You don't have to be best friends with everyone at work but it's in your best interest to at least be friendly with your colleagues. Meet on neutral territory Identify the root of the issue you have with a coworker and ask him or her out to lunch to discuss how to make the situation better.Start the conversation by focusing on any shortcomings you might have advised Taylor. Get the conversation going with questions like: How do you find working with me? What can I do to help our working relationship? "That is the least threatening way to bring it up" she said. When sharing what bothers you about a colleague starting and ending the conversation with a compliment and keeping the constructive criticism in between can help lessen the blow. "The middle part is the tough part" Taylor said. "You don't need to make any excuses or apologize. Just be direct friendly and upbeat." Use phrases like: "In order to do my best work I need you to..." or "It upsets me when you do ..."Set boundaries You can't control someone else's behavior but you can control your response and how you deal with it.If your dislike stems from micro-management or an overly-talkative colleague create some space without being offensive.For instance if you have a micro-manager that needs frequent status updates that you find distracting and interferes with your work flow set up a time to sit down for regular updates or create a document  that the manager or teammates can access suggested Amy Cooper Hakim an industrial-organizational psychology practitioner and workplace expert.Find a safe haven If not getting along with someone is starting to interfere with your productivity ask to work a different schedule or work remotely."Even telecommuting one day a week and not having to be physically in the same environment can help you get through the day" said Hakim.And while you're at the office limit your direct interaction with the person recommended Paul White a psychologist and co-author of "Rising Above a Toxic Workplace: Taking Care of Yourself in an Unhealthy Environment.""Minimize ongoing contacts and interaction. Having another person present also helps diffuse the energy somewhat."Remember: You don't have to get alongYou are an introvert and your colleague is more of an extrovert. Or he needs to talk everything out when you like to fly solo. It's going to happen so acknowledge the differences and move on."There will be all kinds of personalities in the workplace" said Taylor. "You can kind of acknowledge people for who they are and appreciate people for their differences." Finding common ground can make it easier to tolerate "Try to connect with them either something in your backgrounds interests or just try to understand them better" said White.You need to be friendly with your coworkers but not necessarily friends Hakim said. But you still need to have a working relationship and that requires you to interact and work together. "Stick with basic small talk" she said. "Topics like the weather and sports. Stay away from politics.",Business
The British sports car company McLaren has revealed a new 1035 horsepower three-seat hybrid supercar with a price tag of $2.25 million or £1.75 million.Only 106 of these cars will be made and all of them have already been sold. About a third of them are expected to go to buyers in the United States despite the fact that technically the Speedtail isn't legal to drive on public streets here. But there is a way around that.The Speedtail has three seats arranged in a triangle. The driver sits front and center with a passenger behind each shoulder. The same seating arrangement was used in McLaren's most famous supercar called the F1 in the 1990s.That center driving position violates US safety rules a McLaren spokesman said. So do the pop-out video cameras that replace the car's side mirrors. Americans who have bought the car can apply for a special "show or display" exception that's often given to "technologically significant" cars that don't meet all the rules here. That same sort of exemption was given to buyers of the original  F1 when it was new.Speed and luxuryMcLaren calls the Speedtail a "hyper-GT car." GT stands for Grand Touring an indication the car is designed for luxury and comfort as much as for outright speed. The interior is covered in soft and expensive but lightweight Scandinavian leathers. The driver's seat has a special "directional" finish that makes it easy to slide into but also helps hold the driver in place during hard turns.Like other McLaren models the Speedtail is made largely out of carbon fiber an expensive but strong and light material. Some visible parts of the car are made from a special carbon fiber with a very thin layer of titanium fused to it. This gives the material a shimmering appearance that can have a variety of colors. In other places extremely thin layers of carbon fiber are laid over one another then shaved away in spots to create a stratified look that resembles rippling water. The McLaren and Speedtail badges on the car are made from 18-carat white gold. Most of the car's controls other than those directly related to driving are operated through a bank of touch screens. There a some buttons switches and knobs such as those for starting the car and putting it in drive or reverse. These are mounted above the driver's head.Moving through the airThe Speedtail's body is nearly 17 feet long almost as long as a Mercedes-Benz S-class full-sized sedan. That copious length is sculpted to optimize the car's aerodynamics. Fittingly the Speedtail is wing-shaped allowing it to slip easily though the air while causing as little speed-robbing turbulence as possible. The small video cameras that are used in place of side mirrors -- video images are displayed on two screens inside the car -- largely eliminate the aerodynamic drag mirrors can cause.The front wheels are covered in aerodynamic shields that stay still as the wheels spin. These prevent the wheels from disrupting air flow over the car. A pair of flaps seamlessly connected to the back of the car move up and down automatically providing the right amount of downward force to the rear wheels.A special "Velocity Mode" allows the car to reach its 250 mile per hour top speed. In this mode the car drops 1.4 inches or 35 millimeters closer to the road and the side cameras retract into the car's body. McLaren isn't providing technical details of the Speedtail's hybrid power system but the gasoline engine is expected to be similar to the turbocharged V8s used in other McLaren cars. The first Speedtails will be delivered to customers in 2020 McLaren said.,Business
 (CNN)Amy Bohutinsky found her home the way millions of Americans do: on Zillow.But she's not your average Zillow user. She's the company's chief operating officer. That gave her search added weight that ultimately benefits users. "When it's our own finances at stake with the purchase of a home you feel it a lot more" Bohutinsky says. "That's where some of our best ideas come from."She says Zillow employees often return from house hunting and say "'This worked for me this didn't.' 'This missing piece of data really bummed me out and here's how I think we should fix it.' We always try to keep a dialogue going."Finding a home is not just about picking a house it is so much more: the neighborhood the schools the relative value of the house to others in the community the property's potential.Providing house hunting details traditionally discovered by word-of-mouth (like school information community vibe neighborhood amenities access to transit and commuting times) to users online has been a driving force for Bohutinsky during her 13 years at Zillow. Much of that information is now available on Zillow and Trulia the real estate site Zillow bought in 2014. Bohutinsky will leave her position as COO at the end of this year but will remain on the company's board of directors.Here are some lessons she learned while searching for a home near Seattle before buying a waterfront fixer-upper in 2012.Make a wish listBohutinsky and her husband Francesco Crocenzi an architect-turned-private chef had two kids under the age of five at the time they started looking. They not only wanted great schools but a place their kids could be kids.She recalls growing up in the Midwest in a neighborhood where she could ride her bike freely and play in the woods."That kind of experience is more and more rare for families these days especially around big urban centers" she said. "But we wanted to find something where our kids could have that kind of freedom in their childhood. We were looking for family neighborhoods either inside or slightly outside the city."And as long as they were making a list she said they loved the idea of being near water. "In Seattle waterfront properties don't come on the market very much." Zero in on a neighborhoodBohutinsky learned about their current neighborhood from colleagues who grew up there. "They talked about what a family-oriented neighborhood this is how there's a beach club down the street and how wonderful it is for kids. But that was something I learned offline" she said of the neighborhood just north of Seattle on Lake Washington. "I thought there's such an opportunity for people to learn this online." After her experience she was determined to ensure buyers could get answers to questions like: What is the commute like to downtown? What are the schools like? What are some of the shining spots for people to gather? What does the community do?"That's certainly something that we're trying to serve more of" she said. "That it's not just about the house it's about the neighborhood and the community."Look for bargains no one else wantsWhen Bohutinsky first saw her home on Zillow the listing said the house had been on the market for nine months."And whenever you see that on a listing you immediately think 'Okay there's something wrong with this house.'" she said. "But we were intrigued. We liked the neighborhood and the area we loved that it was on the water. So we came to take a look at it."She didn't have high expectations.It felt like a 1950's house that hadn't been remodeled she recalled. It didn't have good flow she said and the ugly carpet popcorn ceilings and linoleum floors were not helping.Even though the house ticked a lot of boxes for her she realized why the house was still on the market: It was a massive project. "I don't think many people wanted to take it on" she said.Look in person not just at the photosHours of house hunting can be spent swiping through photos and even videos or virtual tours but they aren't a substitute for the real thing.Even after seeing the house for the first time Bohutinsky still wasn't impressed. When they looked out to the water on that gray stormy day she saw big waves and the rain was coming down."It didn't do it for me." But her husband saw something else: opportunity.Have visionThinking about how they wanted to use the space — as a gathering place a family home a community they could grow with — Bohutinsky and her husband began to see that this house could be a home.It took a couple visits before she was convinced she said but eventually she could squint her eyes and see the potential."We imagined kids running in and out grabbing food jumping in the lake and it being a place we could entertain" she said. "It required taking down walls and it required touching every single surface in the house."Now that several years have passed since finishing the renovations they are thinking of starting up again. The kids now 8 and 10 have new needs. So Bohutinsky and her husband are considering adding a third level den for the kids. "This allows us as a family to stay in this neighborhood on this plot of land on the lake where we want to be but evolve the house as our family grows and evolves.",Business
Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He has been a frequent visitor to Saudi Arabia since 2005. (CNN)Now that CIA officials have concluded that the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -- an allegation the regime denies -- the crisis in US-Saudi relations has ratcheted up another level. According to sources cited by CNN and other news organizations there is sufficient evidence to attribute the orders for the death to bin Salman also known as MBS.  MBS has also variously presided over a disastrous war in Yemen; the blockade of Saudi Arabia's neighbor Qatar; the de facto temporary kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister; and the incarceration in a luxury hotel in the Saudi capital Riyadh of some two hundred businessmen and princes who had to hand over tens of billions to secure their freedom in what the government described as settlements in an anti-corruption drive. Astonishingly given the importance of Saudi Arabia there hasn't ever been a Trump-appointed ambassador in the country. The US-Saudi relationship has therefore been largely an informal one managed by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner 37 and MBS 33.  On Tuesday the Trump administration nominated retired four-star general John Abizaid to be ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The post requires confirmation by the US Senate.  What has been sorely lacking is someone of the stature of Abizaid in the Saudi capital to be in regular contact with MBS and to try and provide him some adult supervision. It's hard to think of someone more qualified than Abizaid for the role. Abizaid aged 67 speaks fluent Arabic and once ran Central Command (CENTCOM) which is responsible for US military actions in the Middle East. This gives him great expertise and experience in the region as well as the gravitas to speak for President Trump.  Having largely acquiesced in MBS's foolhardy ventures the Trump administration is beginning to push back a bit. For instance earlier this month the US ended the American refueling of Saudi warplanes that are bombing Yemen back into the Middle Ages. The administration has also sanctioned 17 Saudis allegedly involved in Khashoggi's murder.Every day seems to bring some new story of chaos at the White House not least the defenestration on Wednesday of Deputy National Security Advisor Mira Ricardel because she had angered Melania Trump. That said the Trump foreign policy team is becoming more professionalized than it was under the hapless Rex Tillerson who is widely regarded as one of the least successful secretaries of state in American history.  Tillerson had a dismal record of getting qualified diplomats confirmed. By contrast his successor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has tapped some real stars for significant foreign policy roles. For Afghanistan an experienced representativeIn addition to Abizaid another shrewd appointment by the Trump administration was tapping veteran diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad two months ago to be Special Representative to Afghanistan. Khalilzad is an Afghan American who served as US ambassador to Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. Khalilzad and the then-Afghan president Hamid Karzai worked closely together at a time when the country was relatively stable. President George W. Bush later appointed him to be ambassador to Iraq and to the United Nations. He is already leading American discussions with the Taliban to try to produce some kind of peace settlement. That process will surely take time but it is necessary to bring an end to the conflict in Afghanistan. Khalilzad may also have the knowledge and experience to bring together the fractious Afghan political establishment to try to ensure a somewhat free and fair presidential election next year. The previous two presidential elections were both fiascos marred by widespread fraud. Afghanistan simply cannot afford to have another deeply flawed presidential election and Khalilzad should use Trump's well-known unpredictability and distaste for the Afghanistan War as leverage to tell Afghan leaders that a presidential election characterized by rampant fraud could result in Trump pulling the plug on American support.Other capable appointeesAnother key appointment by the Trump administration is James F. Jeffrey as Special Representative for Syria Engagement. Jeffrey is an enormously experienced foreign policy official a Turkish-speaking diplomat who has served as US Ambassador to both of Syria's key neighbors Iraq and Turkey and was also Deputy National Security Advisor in George W. Bush's second term. Jeffrey was one the dozens of signatories of the 'Never Trump' letters by leading Republican national security officials during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In the past signing such a letter would have torpedoed your chance of serving in a significant role in the administration but in Jeffrey's case his subject matter expertise has apparently trumped the letter. Brian Hook who ran policy planning at the State Department for Tillerson and was widely regarded as one of the few competent officials appointed by Tillerson was named special envoy for Iran in August.The same month Stephen Biegun who has had much experience in national security roles on Capitol Hill and at the White House was appointed special representative for North Korea. To be sure Trump himself is so mercurial that even with the appointments of some real heavy hitters to deal with the most challenging foreign policy issues of our time he can dramatically change his mind on matters relating to any range of countries from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia.,Opinion

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)You could write an encyclopedia about the ways in which Barack Obama is different from his successor Donald Trump. On Saturday Michelle Obama provided a more concise explanation for what distinguishes the two presidents from one another: Obama put country first; Trump puts himself first. The former First Lady while speaking at an event to promote her new book "Becoming" explained the genesis behind the line she famously delivered at the 2016 Democratic National Convention: "When they go low we go high." As Mrs. Obama explained "That motto is his motto" referring to her husband. She continued "I say that because that's how Barack operates" adding "I mean there's so many times when I just want him -- like I know all of you -- to just curse them out." So why didn't her husband go full Trump as president and personally demean and ridicule his opponents on social media and at rallies?  As Mrs. Obama explained the reason why a person would go "low" is simple: "Oftentimes going low means you're acting from a place of ego. You're really just satisfying your immediate need to lash out." Then she shared two key lines that summed up her husband's guiding philosophy on why he avoided going "low" in response to his critics: "The president isn't the president for his own ego. The president is the president for the entire country."That my friends crystalizes one of the primary differences between the 44th and 45th Presidents in a simple yet effective way. While Obama strived to put his ego second and be the president for all Americans first Trump is the opposite. Trump is all about Trump. He's the king of personal victimhood and lashes out whenever his ego demands be it attacking the media as "fake news" or going after late-night comedians for being "unfair" to him. Recently we saw Trump battle several reporters at a press conference for asking questions he didn't appreciate -- including CNN's Jim Acosta who pressed Trump on the migrant caravan. Trump angrily responded to Acosta's questions "That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. That's enough" telling the reporter to "put down the mic." Trump later lashed again at Acosta saying "You are a rude terrible person."Trump even had Acosta's press credentials taken away later that day. Thankfully a (Trump-appointed) federal judge on Friday granted a temporary injunction to reinstate Acosta's press access.In contrast look what happened in 2012 when a reporter for the right-wing Daily Caller heckled President Obama during a speech in the White House's Rose Garden by yelling out "Why'd you favor foreigners over Americans?" Did Obama angrily berate the reporter or revoke his press credentials? No instead Obama responded calmly "Excuse me sir but it's not time for questions." And then when the President concluded his remarks he politely responded to the reporter "In answer to your question sir -- and the next time I'd prefer you'd let me finish my statement before you ask that question -- is this is the right thing to do for the American people."But if you pay attention to Mrs. Obama's words the contrasting responses make sense. Trump has never tried to be anything more than the president of his base. And he seems happy to be just that. He knows his base loves the way he lashes out at the media Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) and anyone who dares to not give him the tribute he believes he's entitled. It's the same reason Trump continually serves his base the same red meat he served on the campaign trail from wanting to build a wall to ginning up fears of brown immigrants. Trump as president never pivoted to the center to reach out to more Americans -- because it's never been about reaching all Americans. It's always been about maintaining his grip on power and surrounding himself with people who praise him accordingly.Indeed even after Trump's GOP got trounced in the midterm elections we didn't see Trump say "I've heard the message of the American people and will try to find more common ground with the other party" as Obama did after loses in the 2010 midterms or George W. Bush did after losing fewer House seats in 2006 than the GOP did this year. Instead Trump declared it was an "incredible" night for the Republicans slammed the media as "hostile" and even mocked Republicans who lost for refusing to "embrace" him. Given that Trump seems unable to evolve we can expect to see even more of his philosophy of "When they go low we go lower." The only question is how much lower will Trump go before he's out of office. ,Opinion

(CNN)Every week I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States. Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing or PDB which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.Here's this week's briefing:Khashoggi: Giving foreign leaders license to kill Your response to the news that the CIA concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) ordered Jamal Khashoggi's assassination makes it appear that you think your ignorance is bliss. And your statement on Sunday that you don't want to hear the tape of Khashoggi's murder only reinforces that idea. The longer you can claim ignorance about what really happened the longer you can delay making tough decisions on whether to hold the real perpetrators of the murder accountable.Your statements that it's too early for a final report may be assessed as misinformation. In the first instance it's been nearly two months since Khashoggi's murder and intelligence agencies across Turkey and the United States have had a good deal of time to assess the facts and evidence before them. And second even if a final report isn't ready an assessment with moderate or high confidence could provide the intelligence you need to make more decisions on a policy response. In fact it already has -- you decided to sanction 17 Saudis even without a "final" report. Your continued public focus on Saudi Arabia's contribution to the US economy and the fact that they "give us a lot of jobs" signals that you care more about economics than human rights and may give MBS a free pass for any role he may have played in the killing. This could greenlight similar operations down the road because high-ranking officials -- especially those who do significant business with the United States -- won't think you'll actually punish them. You will be giving foreign leaders license to kill.We also assess that the decision to sanction 17 individuals linked to the murder last week was viewed by many as a decision not to sanction MBS. Focusing on some of his henchmen the sanctions were likely considered a get-out-of-jail-free card for MBS. However we assess that because of the way that MBS governs his minions would not logically undertake such a high-stakes assassination without him at least condoning the operation. Israel: Less peace in the Middle EastIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition is likely crumbling. Netanyahu's political jockeying and the potential for snap elections make a peace deal even less likely in the near term. Should he survive this current crisis -- and make it through the end of his fourth term -- he'll probably try to look tougher on the Palestinians in order to safeguard his political future.Netanyahu is facing calls to hold early elections -- including from his finance and interior ministers.  He needs 61 seats in Parliament to keep his coalition's majority and after Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman resigned on Wednesday withdrawing his party from Netanyahu's governing coalition he is close to losing the majority he needs to stay in power.Lieberman resigned over opposition to the ceasefire Netanyahu signed with Hamas calling it "surrendering to terror." He's openly called for a stronger military response to Hamas even if it sparks wider conflict. Several others -- including the ministers of environmental protection and justice -- also opposed the ceasefire.Education Minister Naftali Bennett from the right-wing Jewish Home Party (the third largest party in Netanyahu's governing coalition) is demanding an appointment as the new Minister of Defense. If his wish is not granted he could resign and topple the governing coalition because it won't have enough seats in Parliament to qualify as the majority coalition. While Israeli security forces prepare for violent protests along Gaza's border with Israel and possibly more rockets launched into Israel from Gaza we should expect Netanyahu to play up the security risks of enhanced political uncertainty.  He's already warning that toppling his government could lead to the formation of a leftist coalition citing a similar shift in government in 1992 which led to the Oslo Peace Accords the following year. Netanyahu referred to the agreement -- which was intended to broker Middle East peace -- as the "Oslo disaster" and warned on Sunday that in a "period of security sensitivity it's wrong to go to elections." While Israeli media reported earlier this month that your son-in-law Jared Kushner is planning to publicly debut in the next two months his plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians our analysis indicates that the political turmoil in Israel makes the prospects for Kushner's plan look even dimmer in the near term. Netanyahu will want to look tough on the Palestinians which we judge means that he will publicly and privately denounce any prospects for negotiating while he focuses on protecting his own political future.Pence post-op: Complications aboundWith less than two weeks until you see Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Argentina Vice President Mike Pence's recent remarks on trade negotiations between the US and China -- and public unwillingness to espouse any flexibility -- will likely complicate trade negotiations.  They were probably seen as a continuation of your preferred tactic of taking on publicly strong positions as part of the US negotiating strategy. Pence's remarks indicated that you are demanding massive changes to China's political economic and military activities. His openly confrontational statements -- including his threatening China with a Cold War scenario -- will likely complicate Xi's own approach to your meeting. While the Chinese know that you like to threaten your negotiating partners with black-and-white scenarios Xi will not want to be seen as responding to US threats. We assess that if you really want to make a deal with Xi -- even if it is just to declare a tariff ceasefire -- keeping it quiet on the Western front and minimizing public threats in the run-up to the G-20 would be most helpful. Continued threats like those issued by the Vice President will create further negotiating complications.,Opinion

(CNN)Although Roger Ailes the former CEO of Fox News died in May 2017 he continues to shape our political world through his TV network. And in the months since President Donald Trump has consummated the marriage between the network and the Republican Party.Fox News which Trump and his surrogates appear on regularly has been largely supportive of the President's agenda. This is not a surprise since what we consider to be Trumpian politics is in the DNA of the network. A new documentary "Divide and Conquer" (opening December 7) makes this clear through a disturbing look into Ailes the entrepreneur who built Fox News. The director Alexis Bloom told me she wanted to make this film because we "live in Roger's world" and need to know more about the "scaffolding of America" from which Trump came.  When Rupert Murdoch hired Ailes to head his network in 1996 the Republican political operative dreamed of creating a partisan news-entertainment network that sold conservatism in an angry and eye-popping way. The station would appeal to Americans who lived in "fly-over country" and felt their voices were being ignored by traditional media outlets. When the channel's viewership boomed as a result of its coverage of President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky Ailes doubled down on this kind of pointed storytelling. The network also tried to package itself as legitimate journalism bringing on serious reporters like Shep Smith and Alisyn Camerota. But the real stars were always its opinionated personalities such as Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. Journalism as Camerota (now a CNN anchor) said in a panel that followed the New York City screening of the film was not Ailes' central concern. He was a "television wizard" she said who was great at "sloganeering" and "messaging." As Camerota told me in an email "in my experience in a hundred conversations we had about work he never discussed journalism -- never talked about the rules or the practice of it which led to significant on-air mistakes. I often saw Roger break the rules of journalism."Ailes promoted certain approaches to conservative politics that deeply impacted Trump an avid Fox News viewer whether he is conscious of them or not. The most obvious is that Ailes believed politicians had to shape their actions based on how they would play on television. As the film shows after Ailes first met Republican candidate Richard Nixon in 1968 during his appearance on the "Mike Douglas Show" (where Ailes was a producer) he explained to him that he would never win "without the skillful use of television."  As a Republican campaign consultant in the 1980s for numerous candidates Ailes continued to impart this lesson on the GOP. He helped Mitch McConnell win a Senate seat in Kentucky for instance by humanizing his cold demeanor through campaign ads depicting him fishing (McConnell had no idea how to fish). Meanwhile Trump has a presidency that is tailor-made for television. As the film reminds us Trump's regular appearances on Fox & Friends were the reason Republican primary voters could accept his candidacy in 2016. He has banked everything on tweets rallies and provocations aimed at garnering attention on the network feed."Divide and Conquer" also shows that Ailes' chronic struggle with hemophilia led him to understand the power of fear in the public imagination. He was terrified of hurting himself and bleeding to death. He lived his entire life scared seeing enemies all around and he was prepared to strike hard against any potential threat. According to one high school friend interviewed in the film "Roger's daily life was a fear of annihilation."  Ailes also loved to tell people a story about his father asking him to jump from the top of a bunk bed and then not catching him -- the lesson being never trust anyone. The story may not be true but Ailes telling it perfectly captured the way that he saw the world. Ailes understood that everyone had some fear of their own -- and he made that part of the way that Fox News told America what was happening in the world. The network garnered high ratings by stoking those anxieties and making certain the public kept tuning in because they were so terrified about what would come next. Trump has similarly trafficked in fear -- most recently playing up the threat posed by a caravan of "invaders" who in reality are largely poor Latin American migrants seeking better lives in the US.Ailes was willing to do whatever was necessary to destroy his opponents and to maintain power. This too is quintessential Trump. His total war outlook was evident in the sleepy town of Cold Spring New York where Ailes and his wife lived. The town was trying to stop him from removing trees that blocked the scenic views from his mansion. Ailes went to war. He purchased the local newspaper the Putnam County News so that he could use it as a media bullhorn against local politicians. Ailes appeared at town hall meetings to rail against local officials and he threw his support behind campaigns to defeat officials who were against him. This is the attitude that Trump brings to his presidency every day. He uses his bullhorn to tear down every opponent."Divide and Conquer" also makes it clear that Ailes' television baby was one that didn't take the feminist revolution of the 1970s very seriously. According to people interviewed for the film the network treated female talent as sexualized objects. Ailes allegedly asked for sex in exchange for jobs while the network required female correspondents to dress in provocative clothes and position themselves in certain ways to highlight their legs (a tactic he used in America's Talking a failed cable network he launched before starting Fox). Ailes denied the charges against him.More recently Trump has repeatedly made clear his disregard for the #MeToo movement a modern manifestation of the feminist revolution. Too often Fox News is considered to be just one more channel in the universe of cable television. But the network has actually been a major force in American politics and it has helped to reshape the modern Republican Party. The station has also insulated Trump from some of the fallout he otherwise would have experienced due to his radical style of governance and polarizing political views.Ailes had a dream in 1968 when he first met Nixon -- and with the Trump presidency that dream has come true. Trump has made certain that there is no daylight between the rhetoric and message of Fox News and the mainstream Republican Party. The question for the GOP is whether the party is willing to continue paying the price? Former Fox personality Glenn Beck warns in the film "It is easy to make somebody into a monster. It's hard to see that you're on that path too." The midterms exposed the limits of how much Fox News appeals to voters outside the narrowing Republican base. Many Americans don't subscribe to Ailes' vision of the world. Democrats now have the potential to render the world that Ailes created politically irrelevant.,Opinion
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)They are the images we can't unsee -- the torches on a college campus and the moment of a car's impact in Charlottesville the crime scene tape and the vehicles of first responders in Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks the swastikas painted on community centers and the screenshots after the fact of dark threats lodged or warning signs missed on social media.But what happens when the image of hate is something else? It may not look so different from what we see in a World War II documentary or an educational curriculum about the Holocaust wrote Jill Filipovic but there it was in a photograph gone viral this week of Wisconsin high school students giving an apparent Nazi salute before their prom: "a terrifying sight" contended Filipovic because "right-wing terrorism including white supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorism is the biggest domestic terror threat Americans now face."If a picture speaks a thousand words then the numbers don't lie. The FBI released updated data this week showing the biggest three-year increase in reported hate crimes in nearly 20 years with alarming surges in anti-Arab and anti-Jewish incidents. That's scary enough. What's even worse argued Maya Berry and Kai Wiggins is that somehow the FBI's numbers don't include some of the "most horrific acts of bias-motivated violence" last year -- including the killings of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville and Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Olathe Kansas.Prejudice need not announce itself in the form of a hate crime either as Koritha Mitchell observed of Cindy Hyde-Smith's "joke" about public hanging when its violent legacy is built into the foundation of our politics: "Only a person whose ancestors or family members bore no risk of being lynched themselves would dismiss as 'ridiculous' objections to making hanging into a public political joke in Mississippi." Rachel James-Terry writing for the Jackson Clarion-Ledger noted that any surprise at Hyde-Smith's lack of contrition is misplaced: she's talking to her base and hasn't hurt anyone who matters to her. Shawn Turner demonstrated that the GOP's issues with race and racism are bigger than any region -- they continue to be a national and as Errol Louis pointed out a presidential problem.Joseph Sakran a trauma surgeon and gunshot survivor cautioned America against letting anyone -- especially the NRA -- get in the way of fighting violence. "Death awaits us at movies and nightclubs at our elementary schools and colleges in our synagogues and in our mosques and churches" wrote Suzanne Roberts in a "love letter" to her hometown of Thousand Oaks. "Don't succumb" to this "terminal diagnosis."There's a reason they call it 'techlash'We all should have known better. That seemed to be the consensus after Amazon announced its HQ2 would be split between the New York City borough of Queens and Northern Virginia. "So much for the Rust Belt uplift story" wrote Mark Muro and Clara Hendrickson for CNN Business Perspectives.Facebook embodied two of Oxford Dictionaries' top words of 2018 this week "techlash" and "toxic." So concluded Charles Arthur who cited a New York Times investigative piece revealing Facebook's shady dealings with a PR firm to declare it's time to admit we're addicted and we might be reaching the same tipping point with social networks that we met on public smoking.The women who won't take no for an answer aren't taking it easyNew US Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia told The Daily that the women who followed each other's exploits on the campaign trail are now meeting up and making friends. But a number of trailblazers who have changed the face of Congress are also still fighting the same old sexist tropes like "I'm fine with women in power just not this one specific woman currently in power" (as Alexandra Petri put it Meanwhile for those who aspire to make politics about more than sexism and snark voters may have their backs. Karine Jean-Pierre wrote that when voters are given the option to express themselves directly more often than not they make choices that affirm love and compassion -- like re-enfranchising 1.4 million ex-felons in Florida and expanding Medicaid.The first lady also refused to take no for an answer this week. As Michael D'Antonio pointed out Melania Trump beat her husband the leader of the free world at his own game publicly forcing the ouster of a deputy national security adviser -- a dangerous move according to Juliette Kayyem. In the first round of CNN's legal battle to restore the White House credentials of correspondent Jim Acosta a judge sided with the network. Elie Honig called it a victory for the free press.In California the apocalypse is getting worseWith a staggering number of missing and a rising death toll the fires in California as Bay Area poet Tess Taylor described it look increasingly like the end of the world: "I do want to say to anyone listening: This year's apocalypse is worse than last year's apocalypse. And what I recognized in myself this year -- even as this past week of bad air has passed -- has been a strange terrible low-level resignation rattling around in me like the low burning in my lungs."To the south Robert Greene lamented in the Los Angeles Times that while he grew up watching the hills burn the fires in L.A. and elsewhere feel different now more cruel -- "Fire no longer seems regenerative" he said. The search continues for victims and for better fire prevention strategies; research ecologist Chad Hanson warned that the Trump administration's call for more logging "creates a dangerous and false sense of security."The kids are (fighting to make sure others) are all rightBut where are the young people? It's a question that dominated the midterm elections and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has an answerThey're fighting for gender equality as well even with new Title IX rules from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that Amanda Marcotte said for Salon "appear to be focused mostly on throwing up obstacles to reporting and making victims wonder if it's worth their while to ask for help." In National Review David French disagreedAnd they're fighting from beyond the grave. Kate O'Neill offered a wrenching remembrance of her sister Madelyn and how her death has further galvanized the fight against opioid addiction: "We call it the Opioid Epidemic but that useless phrase doesn't describe what is happening to actual human beings in communities across our country. It should be called the My Beautiful Little Sister Lost Custody of Her Son Stole From and Conned People Was Raped and Burned With Cigarettes Tried to Commit Suicide Had Sex for Drugs and Money Went to Jail Was Homeless and Ultimately Lost Everything Including Her Own Life Epidemic."What Michelle Obama 'Saturday Night Live' and American literary culture have in commonMichelle Obama's memoir "Becoming" went on sale Tuesday and amid all the talk of why she stopped trying to smile at the inauguration Kate Brower and Laura Beers zeroed in on two ways the former first lady's story could make a difference in the real lives of others: sharing her marital struggles with the former President and her journey with in vitro fertilization. As Brower wrote "(Leadership is) recognizing that being a role model means engaging and talking about one's imperfections not pretending they don't exist."That's a message "Saturday Night Live" took to heart by inviting Dan Crenshaw to appear with Pete Davidson who had mocked him the week before. Crenshaw told the audience "We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other." Dean Obeidallah warned: "The only thing stopping us from doing more of that is ourselves."We may not be there yet when it comes to politics but if what we read is any indication we're making progress at being more inclusive. At the National Book Awards held this week in New York writers of color took all five of the top literary prizes; as noted by Constance Grady for Vox "Throughout the evening speakers pointed to books as a weapon against bigotry and hate."Stan Lee lives on in youMarvel superhero creator Stan Lee died this week at the age of 95. LZ Granderson turned his grief to homage: "No we don't have super strength and we can't fly but we fight society's ills armed with the principles woven into the words of some of our favorites characters. This is how Stan Lee lives on. Not with T-shirts or blockbuster movies but by our willingness to use whatever power we have for good and not evil."

Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music movies and culture for The New York Times Newsday Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)When we watch movies we're tempted to take what they say in one ear and out the other because we're there to look more than listen.  Screenwriters know this and as with anybody compelled to hold up their end of a conversation they seek ways to attract attention. Their names alone aren't going to do it so they find attention and at times immortality through a line or two that sticks in an audience's collective memory bank. Consider for instance: "Gentlemen you can't fight in here. This is the War Room!" from "Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964). The line is credited to Terry Southern who won literary notoriety for such satiric novels as "The Magic Christian" and "Candy" but whose "War Room" joke I bet is remembered by many more people.William Goldman who died Friday in New York at age 87 also started out as a novelist publishing five novels before he turned 33. But though he went on to publish other books of fiction and nonfiction Goldman will be remembered more for his Oscar-winning screenplays for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and "All the President's Men" (1976). Goldman was a virtuoso of pithy dialogue that flowed with sharp tangy momentum. At its most limber and colorful the repartee in a Goldman script allowed plenty of room for memorable lines to leap happily into spectators' ears and stay there.  When in "Butch Cassidy" Sundance (Robert Redford) confesses that he can't leap into a river from a high cavern because he can't swim Butch (Paul Newman) laughs and says "Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill ya!" (Of course they jump.)  And whatever else you want to say about "Butch/Sundance" (that year's highest-grossing film despite mixed reviews) you have to believe that a writer has to have a pretty good sense of pacing and hearing to leave audiences repeating long afterward the fugitive heroes' bemused query "Who are those guys?" Maybe you had to be there to appreciate the full impact of "Butch/Sundance." But Goldman definitely had enough of a touch to resonate through at least two decades of prolific scripting -- whether they involved adapting his own novels ("Marathon Man" "Magic" "Heat") other people's novels ("Harper" "The Stepford Wives" "Misery" "Absolute Power") original stories either made up ("The Great Waldo Pepper") or real life ("All the President's Men" "Chaplin").  These and many others including several he wasn't even credited for have their fans. But since I have the floor I will declare that "The Princess Bride" Goldman's 1987 adaptation of his 1973 fantasy-quest novel represents his single finest achievement. I don't think I'm alone in falling for "Princess Bride's" combination of winking slapstick high adventure enchanting romance and whimsical invention.  And it doesn't just have memorable lines. Even the way one says the single word "Inconceivable!" (as blurted by Wallace Shawn in the film) can expose a "Princess Bride" devotee. If you look for it there's a video of contemporary Hollywood A-listers from Nicole Kidman Steve Carell Emma Stone to Jake Gyllenhaal Jessica Chastain and Emma Thompson quoting great hunks of dialogue from "Princess Bride." (Says Kidman wistfully: "I just want a man to say 'As you wish' " as Cary Elwes' hero says those words in the film.)  Goldman made such eternal magic look easy. And he insisted it was easy (sort of) saying screenwriting was more of a craft compared with the artistry involved in writing novels or composing poetry. What wasn't easy however was being able to make his professional way through the often-impenetrable thickets of the movie industry. The process of dealing with wave upon wave of producers directors agents stars and other Hollywood field workers led Goldman to some rueful hard-won and caustic conclusions about the film business one of which he famously summed up in "Adventures in the Screen Trade" (1983) one of a handful of wise juicy insider accounts of show business.  "Nobody knows anything" he wrote. "Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what's going to work. Every time out it's a guess and if you're lucky an educated one." To repeat: "Nobody knows anything." As noted earlier the man could come up with a snappy line that lasts a long time.  ,Opinion

(CNN)Friday's ruling by US District Court Judge Timothy Kelly -- a 2017 appointee of President Donald Trump -- requiring the White House to return CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's "hard pass" struck an important victory for the free press.If it wasn't clear to the White House before it should be now: the administration picked an absurd fight spurred by a presidential temper tantrum dug into an untenable position and is now very far out on a very thin branch in the courts.By basing his ruling on procedural due process rather than substantive First Amendment grounds Judge Kelly stopped just short of delivering a full vindication of the constitutional right of free press but he went far enough to make clear where the case is headed.As a basic principle anytime the government takes away a person's rights or property it must afford that person some level of process (hence "due process"); the extent of the required process depends on the importance of the rights or property at issue. Judge Kelly ruled that the White House took away Acosta's hard pass with essentially no process. Indeed the Department of Justice lawyer who argued the case for the administration conceded at oral argument that "there doesn't need to be a reason" for revoking press credentials because "the President has broad discretion." In other words the President can do whatever he wants for any reason he wants and nobody can do anything about it. In his ruling Friday Judge Kelly firmly disagreed.     There are two important limitations on Judge Kelly's ruling.First he granted CNN's request for a temporary restraining order on Fifth Amendment grounds. The return of Acosta's hard pass is only temporary pending further proceedings. The case will continue -- unless the White House pulls out now which they would be wise to do -- and eventually Judge Kelly will rule on whether the order requiring the return of the hard pass should become permanent.Judge Kelly has already made it clear which way he leans on this issue; by issuing temporary relief he legally had to make a finding that CNN and Acosta are likely to prevail on the case overall. Indeed it is rare -- not unheard of but rare -- for a judge to reverse course and deny permanent relief.Second Judge Kelly did not technically reach the core First Amendment issue. This was not unexpected. Typically if a judge can decide a case on a procedural issue then the judge will not (and does not need to) address the underlying substantive claim. However this week's court proceedings make clear that the administration isn't going to like where the substantive First Amendment issue comes out either. Making the First Amendment argument CNN -- backed by a broad coalition of media organizations -- argued that the White House cannot deny access to a media outlet based on viewpoint or content. At oral argument Judge Kelly asked whether the White House could unilaterally decide "we don't like your reporting so we're pulling your hard pass." The administration lawyer responded "as a matter of law... yes." You don't need to be a judge or a lawyer to understand how absurd that argument is. It will not fare any better under the First Amendment than it does as a matter of common sense. The White House took a foolish position in the first place by revoking Acosta's access and offering pretextual reasons -- including the laughable notion that Acosta inappropriately "plac[ed] his hands on" a White House intern when she tried to grab a microphone out of his hand despite contrary video evidence for all to see.While that argument has since been abandoned the administration then buried itself deeper digging in in court even as media organizations and First Amendment experts rallied to CNN's cause.  This lawsuit never should have been necessary in the first place and now the consequences of the White House's obstinacy have landed. But there's a silver lining: Friday's ruling struck a major blow in favor of due process and the free press. And if the White House presses the case further in the courts then expect Judge Kelly to deliver a knockout.,Opinion
David Axelrod CNN senior political commentator is host of the podcast "The Axe Files" now a regularly featured show on CNN. He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.com. (CNN)A few years back when Nancy Pelosi was on my "The Axe Files" podcast I asked her what she had learned about politics as the daughter of Baltimore mayor and Democratic ward leader Thomas D'Alesandro. The first and only woman to serve as speaker of the House needed no time to consider her answer."Mostly I learned how to count" she said. "And that is really what it serves me in a good stead whether it's about my own election or my election to leadership or my passing legislation. You really have to know how to count and what is 'yes' and what is 'that would be nice.'"In the wake of the massive Democratic win in the midterm elections Pelosi is counting again trying to determine if she can muster the votes to make history as the only woman to recapture the gavel. It is by no means certain they will add up. After 15 years as the House Democratic leader Pelosi bears the accumulated scars of relentless attacks from opposition ad makers and media outlets. They have turned the Californian into a cartoon character a symbol of partisanship liberal excess and Washington politics. In exit polls from the midterm elections Pelosi's favorability rating stood at just 31% 14 points lower than an embattled President Trump. So toxic was Pelosi in some districts that more than a few new members of the House ran pledging to oppose her return to the speakership even as Democratic House members benefited from the prodigious sums of money she raised to ensure their victories. Pelosi also is the target of restive younger members who are demanding a new generation of leadership in the House where the top three Democrats all are nearing their 80s.I understand the yearning for generational change and a fresh face to lead the House. I hear the concerns that Pelosi might become a foil in Trump's reality show an unhelpful symbol and tarnished spokesperson.But in my two years as senior adviser to President Obama I saw Pelosi in a different light. Not only could she count but she could be counted on to deliver on very tough votes. Pelosi was an invaluable ally and blunt counselor to the President promising only what she could deliver and delivering everything that she promised. She read her members brilliantly and rallied a fractious caucus through many critical battles. There would have been no Affordable Care Act without Pelosi whose strategic and tactical mastery revived a health-reform law many thought was dead. She helped deliver crucial votes for unpopular but necessary measures to save the economy from collapse and set it on the path to recovery. She shepherded important social and economic reforms through the Congress.Cast by her foes as a far left San Francisco liberal she is in fact a canny and measured legislative leader who has deftly balanced the needs of her members with larger legislative and political goals.Members who ran on a pledge to dump Pelosi face a difficult choice and if all of them hold their ground and join forces with those Democrats already in the House who have called for a new leader Pelosi will be denied.To have a chance Pelosi will have to make concessions: perhaps term limits for committee chairs or other steps to allow younger talented members to advance in the House; a new leadership team that includes members who are not yet Medicare-eligible to whom she would delegate most of her TV chores; and an explicit promise of transition.But given this challenging moment in history Democrats should think twice about throwing over her experience -- and Trump should hope they choose someone else. There is no obvious better choice to navigate the next two years with wily Mitch McConnell in control of the Senate and an erratic tempestuous president in the White House.In 1940 Britain turned to Winston Churchill a flawed aging but steely leader to lead it through its existential crisis. When victory was won British voters dispatched him.Nancy Pelosi is surely not the leader of the future. But the savvy septuagenarian is the battle-tested leader best suited for today.,Opinion
Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)From the moment she took over as Prime Minister more than two years ago Theresa May must have known this day would come. May has presented her party with a plan for Brexit agreed on by both the UK and Brussels -- and one by one her ministers and members of Parliament are rejecting it. The future of both the Prime Minister and the country depends on what happens in the next 24 hours.British politics is now no longer only divided between people who want to remain in the EU and those who want to leave. There is now a battle between those who want the draft deal to go ahead in the national interest led by the Prime Minister and those who want Britain to leave the EU at any cost. Whoever wins that battle will decide the outcome of Brexit.On Wednesday evening May had seemed confident enough to walk out of the door of 10 Downing Street to declare that her Cabinet had collectively accepted the draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit negotiated over thousands of painstaking hours between UK and Brussels officials. By 10:30 the next morning two Cabinet ministers and three junior members of her government had resigned and many more were expected to go.Their resignation letters were highly critical of the PM's deal. Esther McVey who quit as Work and Pensions Secretary said the agreement "does not honor the result of the referendum" and warned "we have gone from no deal is better than a bad deal to any deal is better than no deal." May's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab who had been personally involved in the final negotiations of the draft settlement resigned with a warning that the arrangement for an indefinite backstop to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland posed a "very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom." All but one of the resigning ministers were Brexiteers. They are dismayed that the draft agreement surrenders too much control to the EU including the prospect of staying in a customs union indefinitely. To them the prize of Brexit is too great to be compromised away by the reality of negotiation with one of the world's largest trading blocs. They would rather have Brexit at any cost -- even a no-deal Brexit with the high tariffs and potential stockpiling of food and medicine that that might entail -- than this negotiated settlement.On the other side the Prime Minister leads a group of ministers and MPs whose number is increasingly unclear given the scale of resignations who want to deliver Brexit in the national interest. The UK was not in a strong enough position to "have its cake and eat it" as one official notoriously said but could only end up with a deal after compromising with Brussels. May delivered a defiant statement to the Commons on Thursday morning insisting that this was a "Brexit in the national interest." After nearly two years of presenting her party and Parliament with an ultimatum "no deal is better than a bad deal" she has a new three-way formulation: "We can choose to leave with no deal we can risk no Brexit at all or we can choose to unite and support the best deal that can be negotiated." This third option -- of no Brexit at all and therefore remaining in the EU -- is significant. It will force Brexiteer MPs to choose to resign or stay loyal and as a byproduct give hope to those campaigning to remain in the EU by having another referendum or People's Vote.Summing up the heart of the dilemma facing the UK government the Prime Minister told the Commons: "There is no deal which delivers the Brexit the British people voted for which does not involve this insurance policy. Not Canada plus plus plus not Norway for now not our own white paper. The EU will not negotiate our future partnership without it." Brutally she has tried to get a good deal from the EU but Brussels negotiators will not move on the insurance policy.It now remains to be seen whether May can hold together a government of ministers who agree with her and those who want Brexit at any cost. She has already survived the resignations of high-profile Cabinet ministers earlier this year -- including Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. What matters now are the numbers of ministers resigning -- because each one counts as another possible vote against her deal when the House of Commons decides the matter next month. What may be more urgent is whether Conservative MPs are ready to get rid of her more quickly than that -- through a vote of no confidence in her leadership. Her opponents need 48 letters from Tory MPs to trigger that confidence vote. This could come as early as today: Jacob Rees-Mogg the backbench Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer effectively called for that confidence motion by asking whether he should submit his own letter. The battle may be won by those who want Brexit at any cost and the Prime Minister may just have hours left in Downing Street.,Opinion
London (CNN)We have a deal! Well sort of. A mere 873 days since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union the text of the "withdrawal agreement" has been agreed on between the two sides' negotiating teams and Theresa May's Cabinet has against the odds given her their support. Unfortunately for May the celebrations will be short lived. She still faces a number of hurdles both in Brussels and back home before she can call Brexit a success.First back to BrusselsWith the UK Cabinet now in line an emergency summit of the EU council -- the 28 member states that make up the European Union -- will be called for November. Or at least May hopes it will.At this summit the member states will agree to the  withdrawal text allowing it to move to legislative chambers of both the EU and the UK.Owing to the fact the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has at every stage worked closely with the EU27 -- the 28 member states minus the UK --  it's assumed that this will be little more than a rubber-stamp exercise.Next to the House of CommonsThis will be the trickiest part of the process and the PM could be forgiven for banging her head against a wall. It has long been acknowledged that the political reality in London is the biggest problem May faces. And it will all come to a head when Members of Parliament get to show the PM exactly what they think of her deal.Last year Parliament won the right to have a vote on the draft agreement -- something the government was keen to avoid.This is known in the UK as the "meaningful vote" and it allows MPs the chance to give their verdict on the contents of the withdrawal text and the associated political agreement on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.Since May lost her majority in Parliament after an ill-advised a snap election in 2017 the arithmetic has looked challenging for her.The priority for the opposition Labour Party is to bring down May's government and force an election so it is virtually guaranteed to vote against the deal. But May also knows that a significant chunk of her own MPs detest the agreement she has struck with the EU and are ready to vote it down.Then there's the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party or DUP whose 10 MPs prop up her government. The DUP has been adamant from day one that any deal that undermines Northern Ireland's place as part of the United Kingdom would lead to them voting against the PM.If May loses this vote then all bets are off. The government has long maintained that it's her deal or no deal but in reality it could still make an appeal to Brussels and try to get some further concessions.In theory the government -- at this point led by May or someone else -- could bring a revised deal back to the Commons and have another go at getting it through. Failure to do so would most likely result in the government falling a general election and myriad potential outcomes including a second referendum.But if she wins this vote...Even more drama in the CommonsAssuming the meaningful vote passes -- a huge assumption at this point -- it then needs to be translated into UK law. This is where the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill comes in. That will formally make legal the terms under which the UK will leave the European Union and enter the implementation period. Normally lawmakers can amend legislation such as this and frustrate the government. But as Brexit is an agreement between the UK government and the EU which doesn't have a vote in the House of Commons it's hard to see how MPs could influence it (though they could make life very difficult for the UK government). Failure of the vote to pass at this stage would presumably lead to Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal and a major political crisis. But if May manages to get the withdrawal bill through...Still more drama in the CommonsNext the seldom talked-about Constitutional Reform and Governance Act of 2010 which requires the government to lay before Parliament any changes to international treaties with an explanatory memorandum. At this stage one would assume that having cleared Parliament this would be a done deal. But Brexit has always been an ugly street fight. Those still opposed to the deal going through could be expected to pick up whatever rocks they can find and hurl them at the government.Back to BrusselsIf the deal has made it this far the final process of ratifying the agreement moves to the European Parliament. Seeing as by now the agreement will have already been agreed at Council level and in the UK's Parliament it is hard to see a reason for the EU Parliament to mess it up -- especially as most in Brussels want Brexit out of the way so they can concentrate on the European elections taking place next year. But Brexit as you might have gathered by now can be weird. However assuming it passes this final phase...Bong! 29 March 2019 -- Brexit dayDespite the wishes of many hardline Brexiteers Big Ben will not chime in the UK's new era of independence. But should that day be marked by the draft agreement the Cabinet is thought to be shown on Wednesday this week those Brexiteers will likely consider themselves to have lost the battle and have little to celebrate.,Opinion
Holly Thomas is a freelance journalist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)Ever since Steve Bannon was fired as US President Donald Trump's chief strategist last year he has clutched at every publicity straw he can grasp. Undeterred by the loss of his second job as executive chairman at Breitbart in January he has pushed his campaign for worldwide national populism and declared his support for far-right leaders all over Europe even backpedaling on his former rejection of hated "establishment" platforms to further his cause. Many have protested with figures such as Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon refusing to appear alongside him at the risk of "normalizing far-right racist views."His invitation to speak at Oxford University's prestigious uniion on Friday therefore represents quite a coup.After the news was released and an understandable outrage ensued current Union President Stephen Hovarth told the Oxford Student: "It is only through listening to the opinions of others that we can fully understand those opinions. Whether we are inclined to agree or disagree with them there is a profound intellectual value in critically thinking through why it is that we agree or disagree instead of just rejecting them out of hand."How profound is the intellectual value of "critically thinking through" Steve Bannon? Possibly very. He masterminded Trump's ascendance to the White House and in so doing correctly identified a hunger felt by swathes of the American population that was neglected at a bitter cost by the left. Under Bannon's stewardship Breitbart pedaled myths about black crime homophobia transphobia misogyny and islamophobia. His advocacy of national populism echoes -- and very deliberately expatiates -- far-right movements across Europe. He certainly merits urgent critical appraisal by anyone who is not a fan of ethno-nationalism or white supremacy."I think it's fine" one former Oxford Union president told me when I asked them what they thought of Bannon's invitation. "Everyone will have a lot of fun the members the people protesting outside... it will be a fun day out."It all comes down to -- on a high philosophical level -- freedom and the ability to understand. There is a lot of database evidence that many people's ability is not that good... but ultimately I believe in freedom."Freedom though is a currency whose value tends to diminish in proportion to the amount one has of it. It is easy when one has only ever known an abundance of freedom to take it for granted. When the news of Bannon's invite broke the Oxford Labour Muslim network posted a statement saying: "This cheap and dangerous publicity stunt can only be carried out by those who will never face the consequences of white supremacy and hate speech in their day to day lives."Those consequences can be devastating. The normalization of far-right rhetoric the like of which Bannon consciously nurtured both at Breitbart and in the White House has put wind into the sails of neo-Nazis. It has made light of atrocities like the Charlottesville violence in August last year and stoked suspicions that immigrants are dangerous criminals. It has legitimized the kind of hatred which puts anyone who does not fit some twisted "all-American" ideal -- ironic given Bannon's purported hatred of the establishment -- in real danger.One could pick from any number of Bannon's one-liners whack a question mark at the end and interrogate it over the course of a few thousand words. You could essay debates on the reasoning behind statements like "guns are not a problem" "Trump's zero tolerance on the border is a humanitarian policy" "Tommy Robinson has got to be released from prison" or "Let them call you racist xenophobes nativists homophobes misogynists -- wear it as a badge of honour!" citing countless interviews Bannon has already given on these subjects. He has said it all before. So why ask him to repeat himself?"The students will be able to challenge themselves against him" the ex-Union President enthused. "I think they could land a punch. Unless something has changed why not carry on as normal?" That question of course rests partly on the assumption that "normal" hitherto has been fine. That it is OK for dubious and even dangerous characters to be allowed into the bosom of one of the most renowned universities in the world for students to play with them. It has been acknowledged by past members that for some -- relevant late examples being Boris Johnson and Michael Gove -- the debate itself is just a "side-show;" a means to a wholly selfish end. This must also follow for the guests which renders the motivations of the individual and the capacity of the platform at Oxford to facilitate them crucial.Bannon's rhetorical calling cards include: Jackson Pollock-smatterings of military terms aggressive calls to action swerving questions that don't serve his purpose advocating for far-right leaders in America Italy France Switzerland and Hungary appeals to emotions above facts and interrupting people. They do not include considered answers or engagement with any kind of meaningful argument. In real life when you hand Steve Bannon a mic he runs with it.I asked the former Oxford Union President whether there was anyone whose invitation they would deem a "move too far" for the Union. After a pause they replied: "Off the top of my head I think anyone who would use it to break the law -- slander hate speech etc. And anyone whose physical presence would endanger the students."I would also say that if someone very very controversial is invited it should be the case that they have to submit to lots of questions and challenges from the audience. If not that obviates the point."To my mind that point is superseded by another. If flexing the intellectual muscles of a group of students comes at the cost of amplifying a man whose political program thus far has endangered the lives of thousands -- even millions -- of people across the world and who is not done yet it is not worth it.,Opinion
Rahila Gupta is a freelance journalist and writer. Her books include "Enslaved: The New British Slavery." Follow her on Twitter: @RahilaG. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely hers. (CNN)Has Asia Bibi left Pakistan or not? The rumor mill is working overtime because peace in Pakistan depends on the whereabouts of the Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after nine years in prison.News of her acquittal on October 31 was met with the shutdown of major roads in cities such as Lahore Karachi and Islamabad where cars were burnt and smashed by mobs organized by the Tehreek e Labbaik party (TLP) an extremist religious party.Even the news of her release from prison was greeted by a baying mob of thousands of men who waved banners demanding that she be hanged -- a terrifying and visceral picture of the patriarchy in action.Despite being declared innocent by the courts it is Asia who is on the run like a criminal and needs to leave the country before the mobs track her down.Even her lawyer Saiful Malook had to uproot his life and family and seek asylum in the Netherlands. Other less well-known members of her legal team like Muhammad Aman Ullah who has stayed behind in Pakistan is fearful for his life.How did this happen in a so-called democracy like Pakistan? Ever since the military dictator Zia ul Haq began the Islamisation process of Pakistan in the 1980s religious leaders have acquired unprecedented power. Saiful Malook who I interviewed in late 2017 while he was preparing Asia's case lays the blame firmly on Zia ul Haq."He made them ministers gave them cars built them bungalows got them involved in government. Before that the religious leaders were quite weak now they are stakeholders in government and in corruption."It was Zia ul Haq who revived the dormant British law on blasphemy by increasing the maximum penalty from 10 years to death. Yet the irony is that to date no one has been executed by the state on the charge of blasphemy but many have been killed by the mob -- one estimate is 75.It is also this mob rule that prevents the quick dispatch of blasphemy cases in the lower courts even when the evidence provided is as flimsy as a flight of fantasy.The political strategy of the extremists has been to pack out the courts at every blasphemy hearing so that judges are reduced to nervous wrecks and refuse to take on cases pleading ill health.If they do hear the cases they simply do not acquit defendants. Lower-court judges are typically less educated and more sympathetic to the religious lobby.Saiful Malook recounts the story of the judge who sentenced Asia Bibi to death who has preserved the pen which he used to sign off her judgment as a source of pride. The higher up you go in the Pakistani legal system the more likely you are to get justice because judges further up the hierarchy are paid well and have security provided by the state.Of course even this security can turn out to be illusory as Salman Taseer Governor of Punjab was to discover when he was killed by his own guard in 2011 for visiting Asia in prison and calling for her to be released.The few lawyers who take on these life-threatening cases command huge fees. Many of the blasphemy victims like Asia are just too poor to go all the way up to the Supreme Court and languish for years in prison.But Asia caught the public imagination and donations poured into her campaign from all over the world. Rights organizations like Amnesty International also stepped in to help fund some of the legal fees.Although the leadership of subsequent governments after Zia has been drawn from the liberal elites whose personal lives have eschewed religion to a greater or lesser degree all of them except General Pervez Musharraf have relied on religious parties for their power. It was a strategy of appeasement and vote garnering. Benazir Bhutto was the great feminist hope when she succeeded Zia but failed to overturn his Hudood ordinances which for example required women to produce four witnesses to prove rape to avoid charges of adultery. Nawaz Sharif condemned religious violence against minorities but did very little to reverse the sharification of Pakistan.  Musharraf cultivated an image of Enlightened moderation introduced some women-friendly laws and pushed back against religious forces.However Afiya Zia a Pakistani activist and academic in her new book "Faith and Feminism in Pakistan" says his policies were "more symbolic than transformative" while the backlash of radical conservatism against women went unchecked.Imran Khan elected to power recently and yet to shake off his image as playboy of the Western world plays a similarly duplicitous game.He has valorized the Pakistani Taliban for standing against US imperialism has aligned with religious-right parties like Jamaat-e-Islami at provincial level has expressed his support for blasphemy laws publicly supports the acquittal of Asia Bibi and then behind the scenes does a deal with TLP accepting its demand for a review petition of the Supreme Court judgment and to keep Asia Bibi in the country.  The US Commission on International Religious Freedom produces an annual report surveying the state of religious freedoms across the world. Pakistan has appeared regularly as a "Country of Particular Concern" and is the only country to be put on a special watch list in its 2018 annual report.  The religious right has so far not managed to win power at the ballot box but its ability to rouse a rabble and paralyze the country has given it a disproportionate and vicious grip on what's left of democracy in Pakistan. Trump take note: if you court religious extremists you are in danger of letting mobs weaken democracy.,Opinion
Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN)The debate over Brexit among UK politicians has become so toxic that the Prime Minister and leader of the opposition have more in common with each other than they have with their own parties.With just weeks to go before a Brexit deal needs to be signed Theresa May's plans for leaving the European Union have hit a brick wall. Some believe that she has as little as 48 hours to reach an agreement with Brussels or risk having to spend millions in preparation for a no-deal. In 137 days the UK will leave the EU whether or not an agreement between the two has been reached. And given the deep divisions between politicians of all stripes in London and the fast-approaching deadline a no-deal Brexit has never looked so likely a prospect. An emergency meeting of May's Cabinet scheduled for Tuesday to approve the latest version of the deal has been postponed.Barely a day goes by without a Conservative MP proposing a different version of what Brexit should look like and whether the final deal should be put to the British people in a second referendum.Jeremy Corbyn the leader of the opposition gave an interview to a German magazine over the weekend declaring that Brexit cannot be stopped. This goes against his own Labour Party's official line.The problem with Brexit as the Prime Minister is finding to her cost is that it has been impossible to find a blueprint for EU withdrawal that makes all factions in all parties happy -- or more seriously is not furiously opposed by at least one of those factions.In any vote she puts to Parliament she needs 320 MPs from all parties to back her. There are 150 Conservative MPs who are ministers and government aides and are therefore obliged to either vote with her or resign. This means she is far short of a guaranteed Commons victory. Given the state of revolt in her party at the moment she has a lot of work to do.For Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson who resigned as foreign secretary in July May's compromise Brexit plan -- known as Chequers -- gives Brussels too much control over the UK even after Brexit. In his latest article on the subject Johnson said Britain would be forced to "remain in captivity" by Europe because a safety mechanism or backstop would tie the country into a customs union with the EU indefinitely. There are at least 50 Conservative MPs who feel the same way -- enough to cause trouble for the PM but crucially not enough to win an overall majority for a hard Brexit when the final deal is put to a vote in the House of Commons.Johnson's younger brother Jo has put himself at the head of the other side of the debate inside the same party. Jo Johnson resigned as transport minister on Friday declaring the Prime Minister's "failure of statecraft" was the worst since the Suez crisis one of the most calamitous moments for the British government in the last century. He said May's Brexit plans were a choice between "vassalage or chaos" and the risk of a damaging no-deal was so high that there should be a People's Vote -- a referendum on the final deal. These Conservative MPs in the remain/soft Brexit camp are a smaller group than their Brexiteer colleagues but given May has no overall majority in the Commons every MP's vote counts.Even putting aside the rebellious factions in the Conservative Party the issue of Northern Ireland is proving to be the sticking point in Brexit negotiations between the British government and Brussels. There is still no agreement on whether the Irish backstop -- the mechanism that would ensure Northern Ireland remains inside the EU customs union after Brexit to avoid a hard border with Ireland -- should apply to Northern Ireland only or the whole of the UK and whether there is a further safety clause -- a backstop to the backstop -- to allow the UK to end this commitment.The Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party whose MPs have 10 votes in the Commons and are the only reason May has a theoretical majority in Parliament are vociferously opposed to any backstop that leaves the province cut off from the rest of the UK.And then there is Corbyn's Labour Party the official opposition in the Commons which has as much Brexit disunity in its own ranks as the Conservatives. The Labour Brexit policy agreed at their party conference in September is for all options to remain on the table including a second referendum. Yet last week Corbyn gave an interview to Der Spiegel declaring that Brexit could not be stopped. On Monday Sir Keir Starmer the shadow Brexit secretary insisted that Brexit could in fact be halted if the deal on the table did not meet Labour's demands. There are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who would vote with their Conservative counterparts but the rest of Labour's 257 MPs are unpredictable ranging from those who are loyal to Corbyn to those who are loyal to the EU and will block Brexit at any cost. Some MPs want to revoke Article 50 the triggering mechanism which set the path to Britain leaving the EU on March 29 2019 because Brexit is in such a mess. Neither main party is officially advocating this as a policy but the lack of agreement on all sides leaves a stalemate which effectively means an orderly Brexit cannot go ahead. In the Commons there is no majority for a hard Brexit soft Brexit a People's Vote or remain. It is a parliamentary impasse verging on a constitutional crisis. Brexit can never be solved because too many people disagree with all possible outcomes. And so in the absence of any deal and without a revoking of Article 50 Britain crashes out of the EU on a no-deal basis -- a scenario that has alarmed national and international businesses and inside Britain's machinery of government and public services due to the prospect of swingeing tariffs on goods at the border miles of queued lorries and stockpiling of food and medicines by panicking householders.,Opinion
Darren Byler is a lecturer in sociocultural anthropology at the University of Washington in the US. His research focuses on Uyghur dispossession and culture. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)Over the past two years news of the mass detention of Muslim-majority Uyghurs has slowly filtered out of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Western China. These reports have coalesced into the outlines of a nightmarish system of massive prison camps and AI-enabled surveillance systems. Uyghurs a group of nearly 11 million people who are native to Central Asia have come to refer to themselves as a "people destroyed." Chinese authorities have described their project to re-engineer Uyghur society as a response to religious "extremism" and the threat of terrorism. In the absence of a free press stories of violent attacks by Uyghurs have been amplified far beyond all evidence of resistance to state control. Up to one million Uyghurs are estimated to be imprisoned inside the camps according to the scholar Adrian Zenz and Human Rights Watch. Beijing denies the camps are detention centers and instead claims they are "vocational training centers" which students are happy to attend.Amid the growing outrage over the camps around the world more than one million government workers mostly members of China's ethnic Han majority have been quietly sent to Uyghur homes to monitor and assess Uyghur resistance to this process. These "relatives" as they have been trained to call themselves are part of an effort to fully assimilate the Uyghur population by undermining things as basic as religion and language family structure and food culture. Reports of the home stay system published in state media said the visits would "enhance ethnic unity" with pictures posted of Communist Party members posing smiling with Uyghur families.When I visited the region in April 2018 I met a number of these Han civil servants. I asked them to tell me about their work and what they thought about it.Through my research I found that these "relatives" have been given two major tasks when they arrive in Uyghur homes. Their first priority is fact finding. They are tasked with uncovering religious and ethnic nationalist attitudes. They also attempt to understand the loyalties Uyghurs have to family members that have been detained. The manual that is used by "relatives" in Kashgar prefecture advocates asking Uyghur children questions regarding sensitive issues since "they will tell the truth." The information they gleaned through this process is then entered into digital security systems where higher-level authorities determine who should be sent to the camp system. The second priority for the "relatives" is what they refer to as "showing warmth" or care to Uyghurs. In echoes of American military attempts to "win the hearts and minds" of Afghans and Iraqis in the first decade of a related "War on Terror" this approach centers on showing sympathy regarding Uyghur living circumstances and asking questions regarding things that would improve their lives. Of course this form of care does not include extending sympathy for missing and detained family members. The manual they used in Kashgar Prefecture warned against this. It told them to be careful not to be "brainwashed" into sympathizing with Uyghur families.I found that it was difficult for the majority of the civil servants I spoke with to place themselves in the position of the Uyghurs whose lives and society they were destroying. They saw the type of violent paternalism they were engaged in as necessary to find a solution to what they called the "Xinjiang problem." Many of them believed that dominating all aspects of Uyghur life was the only way to move forward with the project of the Chinese nation.George Orwell has argued that when people come to believe in the necessity of their dominance they often become obsessed with disrespect on the part of others. Their domination needs to be loved. In such a state Orwell notes "actions are held to be good or bad not on their own merits but according to who does them." Under such conditions outrages such as imprisonment without trial the removal of children and the occupation of minority homes are viewed as normal and necessary.  Many of the Han civilians who were involved in the broad Uyghur reeducation effort particularly the most recent arrivals in Xinjiang told me that they saw themselves as building a kind of secular Han nationalism. And this impulse combined with the totalitarian control of the Chinese leadership made the question of the ethics of the camp system an even harder question to ask. For them it was easier to say that in the end this painful yet banal process would be a long-term benefit to Xinjiang's Uyghurs and Kazakhs -- another Muslim ethnic minority in the region. After all through this process Xinjiang would become secular and safe for Han people.Many "relatives" believed they had sacrificed their time and energy in reeducating Muslims and in return they believed they deserve to be embraced by their Uyghur and Kazakh "little brothers and sisters." They were not able to think about the effects of what they are doing from the perspective of their Muslim neighbors. As Hannah Arendt observed decades ago about systems of mass oppression elsewhere the banality of Uyghur unfreedom was simply a product of those in power "doing their jobs." Until Han "relatives" can confront what they have been forced to enact resistance to the state-directed human engineering project in Xinjiang will remain unthinkable.,Opinion

(CNN)"One death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic".The cruel aphorism attributed to former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has too often proved true.After the surprise and welcome -- though belated -- call by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a ceasefire in Yemen maybe the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi thugs has created a new mantra: one death can be the spark that forestalls the suffering of millions.It is increasingly clear that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible crime rather than an unfortunate tragedy. The feeble excuses from Saudi spokesmen the changing and contradictory "lines to take" all speak to an old truth: the danger that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. No one seems to think that King Salman ordered the killing so his son Mohammed bin Salman needs to explain his role.The focus of the international community on this murder and its demands for accountability cannot however be limited to this one case. The callous disregard for one life should be an alarm bell about decisions by the same government that are affecting the lives of millions. This is where the ceasefire call by Secretary Pompeo could be so significant.I recently visited Yemen. It is immediately clear that the world's worst humanitarian crisis is in fact a political crisis. The humanitarian suffering is not a natural tragedy but a man-made catastrophe. After nearly four years of war precipitated by the coup by the Houthis and thousands of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition in retaliation Yemen has been brought to its knees.An estimated 56000 people have been killed or wounded in the fighting and 22 million people need humanitarian aid. The current Saudi war plan is making things worse. The bombing campaign from the air causes carnage but cannot shift the Houthi fighters dug in amongst the local population. No one is winning except Al Qaeda and ISIS who gain foothold wherever there is chaos.So Saudi Arabia's allies in the war effort led by its closest partners the US and UK need to deploy their political and military leverage to end the current war strategy. Already the Saudi-led coalition has intensified its push for Hodeidah in the days since Pompeo's statement in an attempt to change military facts on the ground. Secretary Pompeo's ceasefire call needs to be codified immediately in a new UN Security Council resolution. This would stop the increasing violence would allow humanitarian relief to flow vital services to be delivered and the political process essential to a sustainable peace to be driven forward. Britain is the "pen holder" on this file at the Security Council and has no excuse for inertia. Military support from the UK and US for the war strategy should stop forthwith to keep this from being a rhetorical exercise. Germany has set an example by cutting off sales but doesn't have the same influence.  This move needs to be backed up by other measures. All of Yemen's critical sea ports must be allowed to function at full capacity and Sana'a airport must be opened to critical humanitarian and commercial traffic. Salaries must urgently be paid to the 1.2 million civil servants across the country including the doctors and nurses to provide life-saving assistance to the millions in need.There needs to be practical measures to make peace sustainable. Treatment of the wounded and prisoner swaps are obvious candidates. There is also the tougher question of accountability for war crimes that have been documented by the UN. At the Senate's request the US Administration is reviewing sanctions against those responsible for Khashoggi's death. This is one avenue for the pursuit of justice which should be widened to include violations of international law in Yemen.Pressure on the Saudis and their coalition partners alone is not enough. The Houthis and their backers must also feel the squeeze to come to the table in good faith. As Germany is soon joining the UN Security Council it can use its credibility and links to good effect.The experienced diplomat Martin Griffiths special envoy of the UN Secretary General needs substantive not just rhetorical backing. There is a landing zone for peace talks including assurances about an end to missile strikes from the Houthis backed by Iran into Saudi Arabia. But the continued fighting is at best delaying his essential peace-making. At worst it's making peace impossible.The suffering in Yemen has gone unacknowledged for far too long - and has emboldened those willing to act with impunity. Jamal Khashoggi's legacy should be accountability not just for the suffering of one but of millions.,Opinion
Chad Hanson is a research ecologist with the John Muir Project a national director of the Sierra Club and the co-author of the book "The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires: Nature's Phoenix." The views expressed in this commentary are the author's own. (CNN)With the shocking loss of thousands of homes and dozens of lives in the Camp and Woolsey fires in Northern and Southern California people are looking for answers as they try to understand how a tragedy such as this can be prevented in the future.As people struggled to evacuate President Donald Trump in a tweet blamed the fires on poor forest management and repeated the claims before his visit to California. While Trump did not explicitly call for an expansion of logging in his latest response he has previously touted this strategy as a way to curb fires. Meanwhile the federal government is moving to allow commercial logging in areas such as the Los Padres National Forest outside Santa Barbara claiming it will prevent fires. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has also blamed "environmental terrorist groups" for preventing the government from properly managing forests. It is deeply troubling that Trump and his administration would support logging as a way to curb fires when studies have shown it's ineffective. In the most comprehensive scientific analysis conducted on the issue of forest management and fire intensity -- which looked at more than 1500 fires on tens of millions of acres across the Western United States over three decades -- we found that forests with the fewest environmental protections and the most logging actually tend to burn much more intensely not less. This may seem counterintuitive but logging leaves behind combustible twigs and branches on the forest floor which can make fires spread faster. It also reduces the cooling shade of the forest canopy which creates hotter and drier conditions and the invasive weeds that take over readily burn. Denser forests buffer and reduce the winds that drive wildland fires but this effect is largely eliminated by logging. The fact is that Northern California's Butte County which has been ravaged by the Camp Fire had been heavily logged in previous years. In the area immediately to the east of Paradise dead trees had been extensively logged and removed on both private and public lands and commercial "thinning" operations had been conducted across large expanses of the nearby Plumas National Forest supposedly to protect nearby towns from wildland fire. But the Camp Fire burned through these heavily logged areas rapidly leaving residents of Paradise and the surrounding towns with far too little time to evacuate. Trump's call for increased logging also creates a dangerous and false sense of security. When politicians and federal land managers claim the latest commercial logging project will protect residential areas from encroaching wildland fires people may not see the need to fireproof their homes. The way forward to protect communities from wildland fire is not through the stump fields that Trump would like to create on our national forests and other forestland. It is through a purposeful and concerted focus on the communities themselves. We must help the residents living near wildlands make their homes fire-safe. This involves basic precautions such as fire-resistant roofing ember-proof exterior vents to prevent the wind from blowing firebrands into attic spaces and rain gutter guards to keep dry leaves and needles from accumulating. Residents should also maintain their "defensible space" or areas within 100 feet of their homes by pruning branches small trees shrubs and grasses at least once every year. This is the only type of "thinning" that will effectively protect homes. In fact when these steps are taken and when homeowners are given the information and assistance they need the great majority of homes survive even large wildland fires. There is more that can be done too. We must create and fund programs to ensure rapid and reliable warning as well as evacuation assistance for people and animals in particularly vulnerable areas. More should also be done to prevent unplanned human ignitions during extreme fire weather with more rangers and law enforcement officers to stop illegal fireworks and campfires. Some power lines should be moved underground while others should be shut down during extreme fire weather.  But none of this is possible if we continue operating with outdated and misinformed fire management policies focused on suppressing backcountry fires and increasing logging. We need a 21st-century approach that simultaneously protects residents while preserving these rich ecosystems. As a society we have a choice to make here. We can listen to voices promoting the politics of fear and opportunism or we can pay attention to the science and prioritize community safety. Lives and homes hang in the balance of that decision. ,Opinion

He is also co-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War the founding partner organization of ICAN and itself the recipient of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN)The 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice last weekend underscored the great folly of President Donald Trump's threat to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia. President Vladimir Putin's response that "there would be nothing left except an arms race" shows our world leaders have failed to learn from history.The Great War also known as "the war to end all wars" engulfed an unwitting world because the leaders of the great powers did not understand the enormity of suffering they were about to unleash when they stumbled needlessly into conflict.Today Trump Putin and other leaders pursue their nuclear policies with a similar disregard for the potentially catastrophic effects. They plot their moves as if they were playing a game of global chess. But nuclear weapons are not chess pieces and nuclear war will certainly not be a board game. War involving today's nuclear arsenals would be a disaster beyond our imagining.And that may be the root of the problem we face: We literally cannot imagine how destructive nuclear weapons are. Our defense policies treat them like ordinary weapons and we seek the security of bigger arsenals to ensure our enemies' fear of the nuclear unknown is greater than ours. For much of human history a bigger stockpile or more advanced weapons granted a greater advantage in combat. But nuclear weapons should be understood as suicide bombs. Even the "successful" use of our own nuclear weapons against an enemy that doesn't fire back could potentially destroy the world as we know it.  Recent studies have shown that even a conflict between smaller nuclear powers such as India and Pakistan could trigger dire consequences. If just a fraction of the world's nuclear weapons (say 100 bombs the size of the one dropped in Hiroshima) were deployed on urban industrial targets the resulting fires would put enough soot into the upper atmosphere to cause climate disruption. This could then lead to a global famine that would place up to 2 billion people at risk of starvation according to one study. There are enough weapons on board a single US Trident submarine to trigger this kind of catastrophe many times over. To put this into context the United States has 14 of these submarines as well as land-based missiles and a fleet of long-range bombers. All told the United States has 6550 warheads -- most of which are 10 to 50 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb -- with about 1350 or 1 in 5 deployed and ready to use. There is no conceivable security benefit from having more of these weapons nor do we need to worry if Russia has more than we do. Astronomer Carl Sagan compared the arms race between the United States and Russia to two men "standing waist deep in gasoline; one with three matches the other with five." We all understood how crazy this was but that is exactly how our current leaders think about nuclear arsenals. Far from protecting us nuclear weapons are in fact the greatest threat to our security. There have been several instances during the Cold War when either Washington or Moscow began the process of launching their nuclear arsenals in the mistaken belief they were under attack by the other side. Each time in former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's words "We lucked out." Current nuclear policy is little more than hope for continued luck. Pulling out of the INF treaty will only increase the odds that our luck runs out sooner rather than later as the United States Russia and perhaps China field new nuclear weapons instead of working to eliminate those they already possess. Last year 122 nations called for a dramatically different approach and voted to adopt a new Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Here in the United States a national grassroots campaign Back from the Brink is calling for the US government to embrace this treaty.Rather than destroying agreements such as the INF we should be working with the other eight nuclear-armed states to negotiate a verifiable enforceable time-bound framework for dismantling the 14500 nuclear weapons that remain in the world. Despite the terrible carnage the world survived World War I and World War II.  We will not survive a world war fought with nuclear weapons.  We need to eliminate them before they eliminate us.,Opinion

(CNN)On election day as the blue wave washed into governor's mansions across the country the governorships of two of the bluest states remained high dry and red. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Larry Hogan of Maryland both won their re-election bids buoyed by high favorable ratings and overwhelming fundraising. Their decisive victories stand in contrast to a midterm election cycle in which Democrats flipped seven governorships seven state legislative chambers and more than 300 state legislative seats. So how did they do it? Large majorities of voters in both states like their governors personally and approve of their job performance according to state polls as well as national polls comparing them to other governors. Large Democratic majorities in their respective legislatures make bipartisanship a necessary part of the job and they both have taken advantage of opportunities to adopt policy from across the aisle. Sparkling poll numbers boosted fundraising and galvanized support.  Baker and Hogan built massive campaign coffers and were heavily supported by the Republican Governors Association.Apart from their first few months in office when many voters were still unable to rate them neither have registered job approval ratings below the 60s in Morning Consult state-by-state polling.These enviable ratings are due in part to support from groups typically elusive to Republicans. Democrats women people of color and college educated voters have all given them consistently good marks according to polls our organizations have each conducted in our respective states. Put simply they built and maintained the support of voters beyond Republicans. And they needed to. Self-identified Republicans comprised only 30% of midterm voters in both states according to VoteCast data an exit poll replacement from the AP NORC and Fox News. When the dust settled support for Baker and Hogan among Republican voters was as close to unanimous as you can get in electoral politics. Speculation Republicans would stay home rather than vote for a "RINO" (Republican in name only) turned out to be just that. But where both men won was with their second base: Moderate Democrats and independents. According to VoteCast Hogan won nearly a third and Baker won 47% of all Democratic voters in their respective states. Both won handily among independent voters. They also outperformed their challengers among key demographics: women and college-educated voters. Baker ran nearly even with his Democratic rival in urban areas and among people of color in Massachusetts a remarkable achievement in this racially charged and geographically polarized political moment. Maryland has considerably more African-American voters than Massachusetts and Hogan earned support from just under 30% of them all while running against an African-American opponent.   President Trump played a role too. VoteCast data showed him to be deeply unpopular with voters in both states and that was a significant factor in determining their vote. Baker and Hogan's Democratic opponents tried in vain to link them to Trump by any possible association no matter how tenuous. It didn't work.  Their mix of strategic avoidance -- breaking with the President early and often while keeping open the possibility of working with the administration on certain issues -- effectively neutralized his very real threat to their re-election bids. Hogan and Baker won the majority of voters who said Trump was the reason for their midterm vote -- and those who indicated he wasn't according to VoteCast data. Trump may have even helped Baker and Hogan by making them look more moderate by comparison. The relentless Trump-driven Washington news cycle sucked much of the oxygen out of the room and pre-election polling showed both challengers struggling to get even their names out to voters. The focus on Trump likely didn't help them with fundraising either as national donors were more focused on retaking the House or the handful of high-profile Senate and gubernatorial races rather than long-shot challengers. Despite their impressive wins at the top of the ballot neither Baker nor Hogan had any discernible coattails. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ben Cardin cruised to re-election. In Maryland Democrats maintained their veto-proof majority in the General Assembly picked up seats on county councils and won key races for county executive and all other statewide offices.    In Massachusetts all other statewide Republicans and congressional candidates lost and Democrats added to their supermajorities in both legislative chambers. It seems that the un-Trump brand Baker and Hogan worked hard to cultivate is independently earned but not transferable.  The big lesson of the victories of Baker and Hogan may be the same one that Democrats used to win the House: Candidate quality matters. Both men are affable and personally likable politicians authentically comfortable bucking their party and working across the aisle.  They represented both a check on power and the ability to get things done. Ironically those qualities are the same that may make both men pariahs in the national GOP where moderation can hinder political ambitions.  But if Republicans -- particularly Republicans frustrated by the direction of politics today -- are getting nervous about another blue wave building in 2020 and want to change course the approach of these two governors could be a welcomed path to higher ground. ,Opinion

No not the movie -- the Strategic Defense Initiative of the Reagan era that relied on a space-based anti-missile defense system. It didn't work well more than three decades ago. And it won't work at all now.Indeed throughout its checkered history the implementation of the SDI as a response to enemy missile buildups has only led to the least effective results -- more missiles less stability ever greater chances of another step toward an unthinkable third world war.Word has begun spreading in Washington that Michael Griffin now 69 and a principal architect of Reagan's "Star Wars" program is back in the Pentagon as "undersecretary of defense for research and engineering"-- effectively the chief technology officer for the Defense Department. Though Griffin acknowledges any workable space defense may still be years in the future he's hoping to revive his dream that has now become Trump's as well.  And the world's nightmare. This project of a space-based anti-missile system also seems to have become linked with Space Force -- a new branch of the military alongside the Army Air Force Navy and Marines that Trump has ordered to be created without any of the congressional action to enable it. The incentive is not dissimilar to the one that so motivated President Ronald Reagan. "We have renewed great power competition" Griffin told The Washington Post. "Well great powers regrettably aim missiles at one another."Regrettably perhaps. But so far the world has largely managed to avoid going from targeting or aiming to actually launching any such weapons of mass destruction. Any number of international agreements have helped to preserve this uneasy peace each more or less observed and negotiated in conference rooms and not at gunpoint. Somehow we must manage to negotiate again if we are to preserve the peace and not return to escalating and ever more sophisticated weapons development.At the time Reagan's SDI was first proposed there were only two major nuclear arsenals in the world -- those of the United States and the Soviet Union. Each side believed it had sufficient destructive power to deter the other side from launching its missiles first. They would most certainly be obliterated by a second strike from a wounded but hardly out of commission enemy. It was a doctrine known as mutually assured destruction or MAD.Then along came SDI -- an anti-missile system that promised to knock out any Soviet capability with impunity. The Kremlin knew it had nothing near the capacity or resources to counter it. So in October 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev came to the summit in Reykjavik Iceland with a unique proposal for Reagan. Each side would destroy its entire nuclear arsenal. But there was one condition. SDI would have to be limited in its pace of development as well -- a gesture Gorbachev observed of good faith. Neither side could have any advantage certainly not one as great as a fully developed SDI.Reagan refused. And thus evaporated the world's last and best hope of ridding itself forever of the nuclear curse. Of course there was a trade-off. Reagan's broad pressure on attempting to spend the Soviet Union out of existence did play an important role in that eventual consequence. Today there is little hope that such a regime change is Trump's goal or is even possible. This is not your grandfather's Kremlin. Nor is it your grandfather's Pyongyang or Tehran for that matter.The Russian military machine has already debuted a so-called hypersonic missile which President Vladimir Putin said last month would be deployed in months. This nuclear-armed "Avangard" system Putin claims can outrun any anti-missile defense system. "We are improving our attack systems in response to the construction of a missile defense system by the United States. Some of them are already in service and some will be supplied in the near future" Putin said posing a direct challenge.For the moment at least such missiles are intermediate-range weapons threatening Europe. By announcing last month that the United States is pulling out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty -- the 1987 pact that grew directly out of the failure to achieve a comprehensive treaty in Reykjavik -- Trump has added yet another layer of instability. While the 21st-century Kremlin has the capacity to produce a weapon unlike the 20th-century Kremlin of Gorbachev or his predecessors Kim Jong Un clearly has the ability to produce an intercontinental weapon unlike any his grandfather or father could have hoped to produce when they ruled from Pyongyang. And despite all Trump's tweeted denials there is clear evidence that North Korea is pressing on in building bases that can launch such missiles.At the same time China not to be outdone by North Korea or Russia says it has tested its own hypersonic weapon  and like Russia is clearly well on its way to developing space-based weapons.Finally there is every suggestion that the mullahs in Iran if and when they are convinced that the American sanctions will not be lifted or effectively circumvented are quite likely to go full tilt toward their own deliverable nuclear force.So unsurprisingly we are revisiting that ultimately destabilizing face-off that the SDI instigated all those years ago -- but this time with a multiplicity of nuclear forces arrayed against the American military with little of unquestionable reliability to defend the homeland. Facing a world of multiple threats no system not even a figment of a fevered imagination can really keep pace. This could lead to a war where no winner would emerge.Trump must find an intelligent diplomatic route forward or we could be headed to World War III having learned none of the 100-year-old lessons of World War I -- the conflict billed as "the war to end all wars" before leading to the Second World War barely 20 years later. The difference this time is that tomorrow's global conflict risks a holocaust of an existential scale on America's own soil.,Opinion

The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Twenty-four hours after Melania Trump went public about her displeasure with the deputy national security adviser the first lady's husband did her bidding and sent Mira Ricardel packing. Melania showed she knows how to play like a Trump and the President is likely none too happy about it.Recapping the Ricardel story requires going back to the first lady's trip to Africa in October. Ricardel clashed with the first lady's staff over travel arrangements as she accompanied Mrs. Trump and apparently behaved in ways that bothered the President's wife so much that she concluded that the White House would be better off without Ricardel. Although Mrs. Trump made her opinion known the President did not act immediately. Despite the "You're fired!" character he played on TV Trump is not someone who enjoys dismissing people face-to-face. If he went to Ricardel's superior John Bolton he likely met resistance. Bolton is as ornery in real life as Trump pretended to be on "The Apprentice." So it was that the matter was left to fester.The idea that Bolton tried to protect Ricardel makes sense when you consider her reputation. Like Bolton Ricardel is regarded as a master of bureaucratic infighting who isn't shy about letting people know how she feels. She and Bolton made for a matched pair.In an administration where intrigue consumes inordinate amounts of time and energy the Ricardel-first lady tussle might have remained a standoff as long as Bolton was around to protect his second-in-command. However Bolton left for Asia on Sunday and Melania Trump apparently saw her opening.With Bolton half a world away the first lady took the unprecedented step of ordering the release of a statement expressing her opinion of Ricardel. "...She no longer deserves the honor of serving in the White House" said Melania Trump's communications director.With this unprecedented declaration President Trump was cornered. (When Nancy Reagan was first lady she quarreled with the White House chief of staff who was forced out but the conflict took place less publicly.)The public nature of the first lady's statement put the President in an extremely awkward position. He couldn't find a way to look strong in the face of his wife's public call for a top aide's dismissal.Consider the choices Trump faced. On the one hand he could defy his wife. Given how she had crossed a bright-line boundary with her statement the President had to believe she would escalate the conflict. And who out of all the people in the world would be more dangerous to Trump than his wife? The answer is obvious. No one.Trump's less-worse option was to get Ricardel out and this is the action he chose. He attempted to save face by saying the deputy adviser would be transferred to an unspecified job but no one should accept this fiction. The President caved. If Trump feels the victim of pressure from his wife it's because he has created in his marriage a perfectly Trumpian dynamic. As a man who believes that life is about winners and losers Trump has long approached every human endeavor as a desperate battle for primacy. If you are not the boss then you are being bossed and for him this condition is unbearably humiliating.Humiliation is the name of Trump's game. When he calls people names declares them to be "low IQ" or observes that a man like John McCain  wasn't a hero because he was taken prisoner in Vietnam he attempts to deprive others of their dignity. He also reveals that his own great fear is to be diminished in the same way.Beating Trump requires finding a way to turn the tables without lowering oneself. This can only be done by someone whose decency is fully established and whose status cannot be ignored.Melania Trump has distinguished herself from her husband by showing concern for the asylum-seeking families he separated at the border and developing an anti-bullying initiative. The goodness in these activities both of which contrast with her husband's cruelty gave her the standing to act against Ricardel.In a week when midterm election losses continued to accumulate and criticism of President Trump's failure to attend an event honoring America's veterans grew Melania Trump's challenge was perfectly timed. She added one more problem to his agenda -- one he could only resolve by allowing himself to be humbled.The lessons in this episode are many. First it's plain Mrs. Trump knows her husband's game and can play it. Second the President can be beaten. Third and most importantly he's his own worst enemy the victim of the concept that everything is about winning and losing and that defeat comes with humiliation. As a man who has always acted with this calculus in mind he cannot trust that anyone will feel genuine concern for his feelings. The man who relishes humiliating others is destined to suffer it himself.  ,Opinion

It is hard work and it takes time: Sweeping change doesn't come from any one election. Leading up to this year's midterm elections that's one reason why so many reporters pundits and other public figures cast doubt on whether young people would turn out to vote. They cited low youth turnout figures from past elections and often various negative stereotypes of millennials asking: Can we really expect change from our young people? Aren't they just too ignorant too apathetic too selfish too lazy to vote? Are they really up to the task of reshaping our democracy? With the results of the midterms now in we have an answer: The skeptics were wrong and our youth are indeed ready to do the work of democracy. Across the country young people turned out in numbers dwarfing the last several midterm elections; for many of them it was their first time voting. Of course the election results varied widely across the board and in some cases their candidate didn't win. But I have full confidence that these youth have made a lasting lifelong commitment to engaging in our democracy. Why am I so confident? Because young people didn't simply turn out at the behest of their elders political parties or other existing institutions run by adults. Rather they took the lead in changing the political landscape building their own organizations amplifying each others' voices turning out their peers to vote and sending our political leaders a powerful message: that hate racism and division are not our future and that a government that looks like and represents the country we live in is. Just look around the country for examples:Since the February 2018 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School the survivors who saw 17 of their peers killed have emerged as the new faces of the gun control movement starting with the March for Our Lives. On Election Day they launched a phone bank to get out the youth vote on behalf of candidates who support sensible widely supported gun control policies. While key races in their home state of Florida didn't go as hoped (and remain unresolved) there was still much to celebrate as the youth vote helped defeat dozens of NRA-backed candidates across the country. In Shorewood Minnesota dozens of students walked out of their high school on Election Day; the school was just one of 500 schools across the country to participate in the national Walkout to Vote movement. In each walkout students held rallies and marched their peers to the polls; whether or not they were old enough to vote they took a strong clear stand telling those in power that they are the future of the country and that their voices must be heard.In North Dakota Native American communities faced a new voter ID law that heightened their barriers to voting. In response teens and college students from the Turtle Rock reservation led a march to their polling place standing up against discriminatory voter suppression with signs and slogans that included "We are the grandchildren of those you couldn't remove." One young woman said: "It made us want to go in there and vote twice as much and make a statement." The power of young people to effect change is not limited to this election or to the United States. I'm proud to have facilitated it and learned from it throughout my own career helping exceptional youth around the world come together in dialogue overcoming immense social political and economic divides.  In Northern Ireland I was one of the organizers of a program that brought Catholic and Protestant youth together for this purpose. I also serve on the advisory board of Seeds of Peace an international organization that does similar work with youth on opposite sides of conflicts between Israel and Palestine India and Pakistan and even among youth from different backgrounds here in the United States. Whether in Lahore Ramallah or my home state of Maine (where the Seeds of Peace Camp is based) the organization is inspiring the next generation of leaders worldwide by cultivating the skills they need: empathy respect active listening and critical thinking. That's because progress can only be made through dialogue and constructive engagement across these lines of division something we sorely need here in America in these polarized times. Each and every time I meet those who participate in these programs or hear about the exceptional young people who made an enormous difference in the midterm elections I find myself newly inspired. Just as American youth are defying conventional wisdom about their political participation these young people elsewhere around the world are wisely defying the pessimism of too many of my generation who see these conflicts as insurmountable. It goes without saying that our young people aren't fully formed leaders. They still have much to learn and the immense challenges they must confront will take many years to resolve as the mixed results of this midterm made clear. But even as we work to inspire and educate our youth we can learn much from the dedication courage and passion they are already demonstrating because the change we need will ultimately not come from those already in power. It will be our youth the leaders of today and tomorrow who are transforming our political conversation for the better. They're off to a strong start.,Opinion

(CNN)It was bound to happen.Somehow some way sooner or later -- we all knew it was coming. Hillary Clinton's name was going to re-emerge as a possible presidential contender for 2020.A recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled "Hillary Will Run Again" by Mark Penn Clinton's former longtime pollster and Andrew Stein former president of the New York City Council sent the media into a bit of a frenzy over the weekend. They argued that the former first lady senator and secretary of state would definitely be back in the 2020 mix -- perhaps not initially -- but certainly by the time the primaries are in full swing. Voters they suggest should not be surprised to see Clinton announcing her candidacy around the time of the Iowa caucuses just as the candidate field is beginning to separate the wheat from the chaff. As the news of the op-ed spread up and down the Acela Corridor many Democratic insiders found themselves silently burying their heads in their hands. Penn's presage struck a chord among rank-and-file DNC staffers who still maintain a hardened belief that 2016 wasn't about a Trump victory but a Clinton loss -- a defeat in a most spectacular fashion brought on by her campaign's hubris.Meanwhile the news that Hillary may run again suddenly put a skip in the step of some Republicans.  Until Saturday many had been hanging their heads low as the reality of the blue wave of the midterm elections which reclaimed the House for the Democrats sunk in."Dear God please yes" tweeted Presidential Counselor Kellyanne Conway upon hearing the news.All of the emotions and excitement may be jumping the gun however. Keep in mind that Mark Penn is not Hillary's spokesman nor is Andy Stein. Their words should not be taken as any sort of announcement on behalf of Clinton.It's also possible that the op-ed could be some sort of trial balloon sanctioned by the Clintons simply to take America's temperature and calculate the odds of one last hurrah before riding off into the sunset. Or it could be a canard -- a carefully placed article meant to throw off Republican strategists forcing them to prepare for a possibility that they had all but written off. The most likely scenario however is that the Wall Street Journal piece was simply the oeuvre of a pair of provocateurs -- two old partisans from the 1990s who are simply seeking to reclaim their space and relevance -- in the current political environment.For the good of the country and the Democratic party we can only hope that Penn and Stein are just grandstanding and that nothing more comes of this talk of Hillary in 2020.CNN's Chris Cillizza gave a perfectly honed accounting of all the reasons why if you are a Democrat or even a Republican or Independent who can't stand Donald Trump the last thing you should be rooting for is a Hillary 2020 presidential campaign. We agree but we think the Hillary question is bigger than just 2020 and the Democrats' shot at dethroning President Trump; we believe that her re-emergence onto the national stage has the very real potential to drive a schism so deep within the Democratic Party that Democrats would not only come up short in 2020 the party might also be irrevocably fractured in two. Clinton's candidacy would divide the it in a way that would make the current distance between the traditional free-trade wing of the GOP and Trump's base of loyalists seem like next door neighbors.In 2018 we saw the progressive Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party and the more centrist factions previously marshaled by Hillary Clinton temporarily band-aid over their differences that were on full display in 2016 for the common good. By agreeing to play nice with one another they were able to take back the House and a handful of governor's mansions  providing the first real check on the Trump White House. But Hillary resurfacing as a presidential candidate would pick off that ugly scab creating a toxic intramural dynamic that would infect the outcome of 2020 and well beyond.We have also seen the demographic divide of the party come into clear view with the recent midterm elections. Women people of color LGBT people and young candidates were elected at historic levels. It's clear that Hillary's election loss and Trump's divisive us-versus-them leadership style helped in part unleash this trend -- which makes it all the more difficult to imagine Democrats turning back to her as their pick for 2020. Moreover how could the party which has been at the forefront of the #MeToo movement over the past year possibly reconcile its role as champion of women with its endorsement of a candidate who many feel whitewashed her husband's womanizing?If there is one takeaway from midterm election night it's that the face of the new Democratic party is increasingly female more diverse and yes younger.We can't predict who will ultimately make a serious run for the Democratic nomination in 2020 nor who is most likely to come out on top. Yet while Democrats should be encouraged by the midterm election results it's clear that they are a long way away from identifying the right strategy and message to successfully oppose Donald Trump; losses in places like Ohio and Missouri suggest that the electoral college math will still be a tough nut to crack.Democrats will need to not only find a better messenger but develop a better message that is deeper than "I am not Trump." If Clinton runs many Americans will only see her candidacy as a personal vendetta or quest for redemption not a move with the best interests of Democrats at heart.So please Hillary don't do it.,Opinion

(CNN)The federal government's 2017 hate crime statistics are out and they show a disturbing trend: Last year as in 2016 and 2015 before hate crimes were on the rise. But what the data fail to show is perhaps even more alarming and further demonstrates the need for an improved response to hate crime.According to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation released this week the number of reported hate crime incidents in 2017 was up 17% over 2016 totals representing the first consecutive three-year annual increase and the largest single-year increase since 2001 when hate crimes targeting Arab-Americans and American Muslims and those perceived to be Arab or Muslim surged in the aftermath of 9/11. We know that in 2017 as in 2016 and 2015 before the increase coincided with burgeoning racism xenophobia and anti-Semitism. The FBI's information shows that crimes motivated by race or ethnicity which rose 18% in 2017 accounted for a majority of all incidents reported with hate crimes specifically targeting African-Americans representing the greatest share while anti-Arab hate crimes increased 100%. As for crimes motivated by religion anti-Jewish incidents surged yet again last year this time over 37% while anti-Muslim incidents which stabilized after two years of dramatic rise remained well above historical averages from before the 2016 election cycle.But despite the reported increase we know that many incidents including some of the most horrific acts of bias-motivated violence committed last year are somehow missing from the official statistics. The murder of Heather Heyer is missing. According to the FBI data the Charlottesville Virginia Police Department reported no hate crimes between July and September of last year. But on August 12 2017 Heyer was killed in Charlottesville when a man plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally. An additional 35 people were injured and the accused driver James Alex Fields Jr. is awaiting trial on federal hate crime charges. He pleaded not guilty. The killings of Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche are missing. According to FBI statistics no hate crime murders were reported in Oregon last year. But on May 26 2017 Best and Namkai-Meche were killed on a train in Portland when a man fatally stabbed them and wounded Micah David-Cole Fletcher after they confronted him for harassing two teenage passengers with anti-Muslim and racist slurs. The accused attacker Jeremy Joseph Christian was indicted on the state hate crime charge of "second degree intimidation" and pleaded not guilty. The murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla is missing. According to FBI statistics no hate crimes were reported last year in Olathe Kansas. But on February 22 2017 Kuchibhotla was killed at a bar in Olathe when a man shot him because of his perceived national origin. His friend Alok Madasani was also targeted but survived the shooting as did a man named Ian Grillot who attempted to intercede. The shooter Adam Purinton was convicted on federal hate crime charges. While all three cases were prosecuted as hate crimes this detail is not relevant to whether they should have been reported in the FBI data. According to federal guidance on hate crime reporting it is the responsibility of law enforcement officials responding to an incident to determine whether there was any indication that it was bias-motivated. After a secondary review and regardless of whether any hate crime charges are brought the relevant agency may then report the incident as a hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reporting or UCR system which the FBI uses to publish its annual report. We should also note that negligence on the part of responding law enforcement officials is not necessarily the cause of these apparent omissions. While the Portland Police Bureau was not immediately available for comment the Olathe Police Department confirmed it had reported six hate crime incidents including the murder of Kuchibhotla which was recorded as an "Anti-Other Ethnicity/National Origin" incident to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Because the Olathe Police Department and agencies from other jurisdictions submit hate crime data using an antiquated reporting format the KBI said it was unable to aggregate these incidents into the data collections submitted to the FBI. As for Charlottesville the department did not return a recent request for comment but had told us in a September statement that the Heyer case and others relating to the white nationalist rally would be reported as hate crimes but it appears they were not finalized in time for inclusion in the official state or federal data.  In some states including Virginia and Oregon state UCR programs publish annual hate crime statistics. Like the FBI statistics Virginia's annual hate crime report contains no data relating to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. However and in seeming contradiction with the federal data state-level statistics from Oregon include two hate crime murder offenses reported in Multnomah County. But without additional information we are unable to determine whether either of these offenses corresponds to the May 26 stabbing. Additional findings from state-level statistics raise questions about the FBI data. In advance of this week's FBI release the Arab American Institute collected UCR hate crime data from 27 states and the District of Columbia. Based on these state-level statistics we predicted a significant nationwide increase reported in 2017 federal statistics. While the overall prediction was correct much like in the case of Oregon we found some notable discrepancies. According to the FBI data just 48 incidents were reported in Maryland in 2017 but state-level statistics indicate a far greater total of 183. Similar disparities occurred in multiple states including Indiana. While FBI statistics contained no data from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department according to state UCR data the department reported 44 incidents in 2017. The federal data as aggregated by the Arab American Institute and also the Anti-Defamation League  reveal that nearly 100 jurisdictions representing at least 100000 people reported zero hate crimes in 2017. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department which has reported as many as 73 incidents annually in recent years and represents over 1.6 million people is one example. Statewide just five incidents were reported in Nevada in 2017.  But the problem of questionable or underreported data is not limited to any one state. Hawaii does not even participate in the national hate crime statistics program and aside from Nevada an additional 11 participating states had fewer than 10 agencies report hate crime incidents in 2017. Many of these states such as Alabama Arkansas Georgia and Mississippi have dark histories of racial and ethnic violence but have not enacted sufficient legislation to address hate crime. If all states offered inclusive protections in their hate crime laws required hate crime reporting and data collection from law enforcement and authorized comprehensive police training on investigating and reporting hate crime incidents maybe then we would have more accurate and representative federal statistics. A renewed commitment from the federal government would also help. In order to improve the data collected under the Hate Crime Statistics Act and published in the FBI's annual report Congress should pass legislation that provides law enforcement with incentives for hate crime reporting and ties federal funding for state or local agencies to the provision of accurate data.Until then we will continue to highlight what the data show and bring what's missing to light. ,Opinion

The views expressed here are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)2018 isn't just shaping up to be a blue wave -- it has also become a ballot measure wave.In ballot measure after ballot measure in the midterm elections voters of all parties showed that when they get to weigh in directly on the issues rather than choosing candidates they often vote for progress: for love not hate; for inclusion not division. For example while gubernatorial and Senate races in Florida are still mid-recount the results of the Amendment 4 campaign in that state were clear on election night. Florida voters voted handily to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated people who have served their time and paid their debts to society effectively re-enfranchising 1.4 million formerly incarcerated Floridians.It's hard to overstate just how critical a win this is for fair elections criminal justice reform and decency. It's harder to overstate how easily the measure won -- with a massive bipartisan margin of victory.Given the unjust racial disparities in our nation's mass incarceration system -- black and brown people are more likely to be arrested prosecuted and given harsher sentences than white people for the same drug crimes even though white people commit them at the same rates -- this is a huge win for racial justice and a huge blow to Florida Republicans' voter suppression strategy. But Florida wasn't the only state where ballot measures helped move voting rights forward in the midterms. Automatic voter registration which disproportionately enfranchises young people and people of color passed easily in both Nevada and Michigan two traditional swing states. In Michigan voters also used the power of the ballot initiative to expand voting rights: They approved same-day voter registration made it easier to request absentee ballots and reinstated straight-ticket voting. These changes passed decisively 67% to 33%. Over on the East Coast voters in Maryland passed a ballot measure to implement same-day voter registration by an equally wide margin. But ballot measures didn't just lead to progressive change in voting rights. Across the country in states red and blue voters used ballot measures to: legalize recreational marijuana in Michigan and medical marijuana in Missouri and Utah raise the minimum wage in Arkansas and Missouri and eliminate the "tampon tax" (the sales tax on pads and tampons) in Nevada.In the ballot measures that may have the most significant immediate impact on the largest number of people in Idaho and Nebraska and Utah voters expanded Medicaid boosting the number of states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and bringing health care to an additional nearly half-million people. Those are people who will get covered in overwhelmingly red states after the voters in those states chose to expand access to health care via a ballot initiative.The overwhelming progressive skew to Tuesday's ballot measure wins might seem counterintuitive. Voters expanding Medicaid -- a plank in the Democratic not Republican party platform -- in three of the biggest conservative strongholds in the country? Voters -- across the country -- supporting voting rights criminal justice reform raising the minimum wage and more by numbers that far outpace support for Democratic candidates?These votes mean many more people mostly working families who otherwise couldn't afford it can access quality health care. They mean more rural hospitals stay open and portend substantial investment in job creation. All this will be a huge help to state budget bottom lines. The 2018 ballot measures and their outcomes show that most voters even those in deep red states prioritize their populations instead of partisanship. Progressives' record in ballot measures on election day wasn't perfect.  Unfortunately anti-abortion ballot measures seeking to deprive women of their freedom passed in Alabama and West Virginia. (Though encouragingly voters in Oregon rejected such a measure.)  But for the most part progressive ballot measures won overwhelmingly this year including in red states. There's an important lesson hidden here: When voters are given a chance to vote directly on the issues they vote for progressive values. 2018 was a blue wave but it was also a ballot measure wave. And there's no reason to think it's about to subside in future elections.,Opinion
Eric B. Schnurer a former civil rights lawyer and associate federal special prosecutor was president of the Drum Major Institute a policy center originally founded by Martin Luther King Jr. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)"When the facts change I change my mind.  What do you do?" the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes was often quoted as asking. This is a question we ought to be asking of Chief Justice John Roberts and Congress in the wake of the 2018 elections -- most notably in Georgia. The Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) gutting enforcement of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act or VRA elevated Keynes' supposed dictum to the level of constitutional mandate. The court ruled that the provisions of the VRA requiring states with histories of voting rights violations to submit themselves to federal preapproval of any changes in voting procedures or electoral rules were deemed unconstitutional because of changes in the underlying facts.  In Roberts' telling interference with African-American voting rights in the South was ancient history successfully swept away by the VRA itself not to mention a New South where torch-lit Klu Klux Klan marches with Confederate battle flags were things of the past. When the facts change Roberts asserted the court must change its mind as to a law's constitutionality. If Roberts and the court's majority mean what they say then they need to change their minds again after last week's developments. Never mind that in the decade preceding the court's Shelby County decision Georgia had continued adopting voting changes that the US Department of Justice found discriminatory roughly once every three months.  Since then Georgia has pursued voting restrictions disproportionately affecting African-Americans and other minorities with renewed vigor: It closed 214 polling places for example. Then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp took the lead on aggressive voting-reduction efforts purging the voting rolls of over 1 million primarily minority voters and instituting an "exact match" requirement that removed voters for any clerical errors or misspellings. When this policy was struck down by the federal courts it was essentially just re-enacted by the Georgia Legislature at Kemp's urging.  (The Brennan Center for Justice for example has found that both reduced numbers of voting machines and increased voter purges disproportionately affect minority voters.) Kemp even expressed "concern" to donors at a private dinner earlier this year that Democrats would defeat him "especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote." No wonder: His African-American opponent Stacey Abrams had launched her career by organizing people to vote. Not surprisingly then Kemp -- still overseeing the voting in his own election -- threw out or held up thousands of absentee ballot applications a majority of which turned out to be from African-Americans until ordered to cease and desist by the federal courts.  That didn't stop a record shortage of voting machines in black precincts on Election Day or -- and this is really the most eye-rolling of all -- what machines there were from running out of battery power in the middle of voting. Even by such means Kemp (as of this writing) was barely able to cling to a narrow majority. The larger point is that none of this occurs in a vacuum. As everyone knows Georgia and other states have a long history of racial oppression -- but just because it's long doesn't mean that it's dead. After the Civil War Congress enacted several constitutional amendments that outlawed slavery (the 13th) established due process and equal protection under the laws for all Americans (the 14th) and prohibited racial discrimination against the right to vote (the 15th).  These amendments in more-or-less identical language expressly grant Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."  Under that authority Congress had reauthorized the VRA's preclearance provision and the formula for determining those states and localities to which it applied as recently as 2006 -- only seven years before Roberts found it terribly outdated. Roberts' approach ignores -- in fact rejects -- the continuing relevance of the Civil War and the history of the Confederate States in construing those Civil War Amendment guarantees.  Whatever the real-world relevance of Confederate history to US today its relevance to the Constitution -- and particularly the Civil War Amendments -- is central:  It was the sole animating reason for the three amendments that dramatically reshaped federal authority over the states. That history matters. Listen for instance to those defending President Donald Trump's position opposing birthright citizenship: They assert that these amendments were concerned entirely with the former Confederate states' treatment of African-Americans not our current conditions (and hence not intended to protect undocumented immigrants).  In short conservatives and self-styled "originalists" ought to be (and usually are) the first to agree that historic rather than current conditions should dictate Congress' scope of action. As such the mechanism to sweep away any constitutional deadwood isn't court fiat -- it's an amendment.  But let's assume that Roberts was correct -- and intends to be consistent -- that the Constitution requires keeping pace with today's realities. The more important issue in the Shelby County decision then is the contention by Roberts and the court's majority that the facts had changed and so too had the VRA's constitutionality. Perhaps the chief justice was correct that by 2013 the VRA's concerns with racial discrimination in voting had been rendered anachronistic by its own success. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg trenchantly observed in her dissent however "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."  It's now also clear to continue Ginsburg's metaphor that putting your umbrella away when it's not raining as Roberts would have it is usually sufficient itself to provoke a cloudburst.  And so it has. Since the Shelby County decision increased restrictions on voting have been enacted in many states where Republicans reign.  But nowhere have attempts to shut down the black vote been as widespread -- and the result as transparent -- as in Georgia.  Only someone willfully blind to all this would fail to see that exactly the same behaviors have rearisen in exactly the same places as before. The Roberts Court majority -- or if it turns out to be so utterly disingenuous then Congress itself -- needs to revisit Shelby County today and reinstate the VRA in the form Congress enacted it.  After all the facts have clearly changed back to well what they always really were.,Opinion

(CNN)Among the most magical urban myths floating around the Trump administration is that Saudi Arabia is America's strategic partner and the relationship is simply too big to fail. Sadly that relationship is already failing.Indeed under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS) Saudi Arabia has willfully pursued policies that have undermined both American interests and values. Worse still the Trump administration envisions a role for Saudi Arabia in its Middle East strategy that can only disappoint. In recent weeks Turkish authorities have accused the Saudi regime of responsibility for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed rogue operatives for the killing and dismissed a number of high-ranking officials.  There's no doubt that Saudi Arabia is important to the United States. Preserving global access to its oil avoiding the chaos that would be unleashed if the kingdom collapsed or became a failed state and cooperation on counter-terrorism are clearly core US interests.  But to concede these interests doesn't mean Saudi Arabia is a reliable security partner of the United States or that Riyadh is America's strategic ally. Saudi Arabia is in fact a repressive police state that has long exported a strain of Islam supportive of Islamic jihadi terrorist activity and that ideologically has been hostile to America the West Jews and Christians. MBS has made an effort to restrain religious extremism. But he's also launched a major crackdown to concentrate absolute power repress civil society and journalists and jail or intimidate his opponents. As for promoting US interests the past year and a half reads like a DIY manual in undermining them.  The detention of the Lebanese Prime Minister in an apparent bid to force his resignation has only strengthened Hezbollah. Bin Salman's disastrous boycott of Qatar made it more difficult for the Gulf Cooperation Council to stand up to Iran and has driven Doha and Tehran closer together and his failed military campaign in Yemen has created instability polarized the region and expanded rather than contracted Iranian influence (and given ISIS more room to maneuver). Saudi Arabia has proven to be too weak and incompetent to be a bulwark against Iran; on the contrary it has been an enabler of Tehran's influence.The Trump administration and especially the President have argued that punishing Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi would jeopardize the much ballyhooed $110 billion arms sales package that was announced last year in Riyadh.  This is baloney.  Of this amount the Washington Post reported there were many suggestions of intent to purchase weapons and "six specific items adding up to $28 billion [of which] ... all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration."The rest comprise a Saudi pipe dream of future purchases not signed contracts most of which are unlikely to reach fruition because of Saudi budgetary pressures. Moreover in the unlikely event that the Saudis put their money where their mouth is Trump's claims that it would produce 500000 to one million jobs in the American defense industry are "fake facts." The real facts are: 1)  the Saudis need US weapons and equipment more than we need to sell them in part because they demonstrate the US security commitment to the kingdom; and 2) it would be very difficult and expensive for the Saudis to make good on their periodic threats to "buy foreign" if they can't get what they want from the United States.Then there's the much trumpeted claim the Saudis are always there when you need them on oil prices. There are many examples of the Saudis bucking US interests when it came to oil supply including its leadership of the 1973 Arab oil boycott its expansion of output to drive down prices in an effort to hurt the US oil fracking industry and its decision this week to reduce supplies to drive prices up. It remains to be seen whether on another occasion the Saudis would move to increase supplies in the wake of a very tight market. If they did so it would be a calculation driven by a Saudi-first not an America-first oil policy.Finally there's the administration's conviction that the Saudis are integral to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. There's no doubt that MBS has warmed up to the Israelis largely because of their common interest in checking Iran and Sunni jihadists.  But direct and under-the-table contacts are a far cry from open meetings or support for a US peace plan that on issues like Jerusalem and borders violates the Arab consensus and could hand Iran and Sunni Muslims a propaganda windfall if the plan is too aligned with the needs of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. King Salman — MBS' father -- has reined in his son on this issue and publicly identified conditions that would be needed to gain Saudi support. In response to the killing of Khashoggi the Trump administration has doubled down on the US-Saudi relationship and would love to find a way to sweep this crime under the rug. Washington need not abandon the relationship but it needs a serious reset.  MBS has become more of a liability than an asset for Washington and we should not be enabling or coddling him. If Saudi Arabia wants to continue its reckless policies abroad and despotic behavior at home it's free to do so but not with American support. And that means imposing harsh costs on the Saudis for the killing of Khashoggi and serious efforts to end the kingdom's destructive and inhumane policies in Yemen.,Opinion
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)What kind of America do you want? It may be the most important question facing voters Tuesday. Penn Jillette has an idea: "All I want out of America now is kindness" wrote the magician and author. "The past few years have filled too many of our friends and neighbors with hate and it breaks my heart... So many of us now agree with the message of hate and play 'ideology' as team sports" he lamented.  "Anyone whose tone is kind will get my complete support." And how about you Ai-Jen Poo? An America that honors families said the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance who is a child of Taiwanese immigrants. With cruel immigration policies "the people who control our government have put a series of moral choices before us. How do we really value family and the well-being of children -- all families and children?"An America that protects "rights protections equality and justice" wrote Alyssa Milano. "Voting is how we prove that our country is so much kinder and bigger and better than that man in the White House."But political scientist Carol Swain warned against sweeping into office "a leftist's counterfeit remake of our nation" especially after "President Trump has quietly checked off the accomplishments he promised to the American people" including a booming economy.Time for a reality check wrote LZ Granderson: "That restlessness in the pit of your stomach isn't there because the sky is falling" since Trump. "It's there because social media has pushed the clouds away the sun is shining and you're made uneasy by the clarity of who we really are and what we've always been."The fear campaignAs the hugely consequential midterm election loomed the word of the week was fear. The nation was horrified in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre.  But as families were burying their dead-- and reckoning with the specter of murderous American anti-Semitism--President Trump Fox News and the far-right fanned conspiracy theories about race and immigration into the overheated election cycle. They invoked their all-purpose Jewish bogeyman the investor and philanthropist George Soros. Naturally wrote Kate Maltby: white supremacists see Jews Hispanics black people and Middle Easterners as the Other threatening their status.  The President needs to do more than condemn the individual actions of racist killers. "He needs to repudiate the conspiracy theories that fuel their bloodlust." Nicole Hemmer wrote that we might have seen Pittsburgh coming. In last year's violence in Charlottesville "the anti-Semitism part of the story quickly disappeared. Most analysis centered on Confederate statues and anti-black racism...a core part of the story." But "lost sight of the specific history behind the Nazi flags that flapped beside them." And then on Thursday the President tweeted an incendiary video about a murderous undocumented immigrant."Racism is a helluva drug" wrote law professor Dorothy Brown. She noted Justice Department stats that show whites had more to fear from one another when it comes to crime. But "facts don't matter now; Trump has a midterm to win." And John Blake marveled at an American leader whose bigotry is losing its ability to shock: "President Donald Trump may be on the verge on doing something that arguably no American leader has ever done. Make racism boring."  Whitey Bulger taken down by a wannabe?The homicidal Boston mobster Whitey Bulger 89 was beaten to death on Tuesday--a day after he was transferred to a federal prison in Bruceton Mills West Virginia. One suspect the Boston Globe first reported is a Massachusetts mafia hitman Fotios Geas known as Freddy. "In 2011 I tried and convicted Geas along with his brother Ty Geas and their mafia boss Arthur 'Artie' Nigro for a string of vicious murders" wrote Elie Honig a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor.  Geas tried to make his name in the mob by showing he was a cold-blooded killer. He did it—and wound up in a prison with Whitey Bulger.  But let's let Honig tell the remarkable story... The "caravan" may just be a minivan All week the President bounced around the country trying to fend off a "blue wave" and whipping up fears over the dwindling group of migrants from Central America most of them children who are in southern Mexico and walking this way—an "invasion" Trump said.   But that's a fallacy wrapped in a fiction argued David Gergen and James Piltch.  We should take a lesson from Mexico. "Since 2010 the flow of undocumented Mexican immigrants has decreased significantly."  That's partly because life in Mexico improved they wrote and we should try to help Central America do the same -- "create better and safer opportunities for the citizens of these countries. We should not cut aid; we should increase it." Alice Driver traveling with the migrants and pausing in Juchitán Mexico lamented how "Trump has tried to erode" faith in America as a "refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty." "A hungry tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet" is not something to fear. But Rich Lowry in the National Review said Trump may be distorting the caravan as a menace for midterm advantage but he "gets the big point right: We have borders and should enforce them."  Fox's Lou Dobbs problem?Hours after a gunman shot dead 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue wrote Jen Psaki Fox re-aired a segment of Lou Dobbs' show in which Chris Farrell from the conservative group Judicial Watch said the "Soros occupied State Department" funded the migrant caravan.  Fox Business later condemned the remarks.  Democracy is suffering from the "partnership between a serial liar now occupying the oval office and a major news network that has evolved from the voice of the conservative movement to a forum for racist and divisive conspiracy rants" she says.   It's already baked in the cake explained New Day host Alisyn Camerota who worked at Fox before coming to CNN.  In a 2016 meeting with candidate Trump he congratulated her on the move but complained that now she was "being mean" to him.  "I tried to explain the role of the free press ... It didn't work" she wrote.     Is Iowa over Congressman Steve King?   The white-culture warrior from Iowa has held office since 2002. Voters should ditch him wrote Jacy Gomez a former staffer for GOP Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley. King recently endorsed Toronto's nationalist candidate for mayor who has said "white genocide" threatens Canada.  King's nativism is "a blemish on an otherwise admirable state...his hate-spew has real world consequences" says Gomez. Health is on the ballotLouisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy a medical doctor complained about Democrats trying to paint the GOP as the enemy of pre-existing-condition coverage.  Not true he says: Democrats are trying to rewrite history. They want to "set the stage for a single-payer health care system" and Medicare for all.    Citing a drop in Americans' life expectancy Georges C. Benjamin executive director of the American Public Health Association counseled voters to ask candidates questions about prevention; the best leaders "address the root of the problem." That means funding public health programs research on gun violence and the health fallout from climate change opioids and more.  "Ask what the long-term effect would be on your community if parents can't earn enough to pay the rent and women can't plan a family on their terms."  Maybe the Democrats are delusional?Conor Friedersdorf a political independent confided in the LA Times that he usually votes "candidate" not "party."  Not this time -- he's voting Democratic. "The reason is simple: President Trump." Voters must decide whether the President "will continue to enjoy the endless support of a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans or confront a Democratic House that checks his power." But Democrats expecting a rout in reaction to Trump may be delusional argued Jason L. Riley in the Wall Street Journal. "Economic growth has accelerated unemployment is low salaries are increasing and consumer confidence is strong."   Two years in "who's afraid of Donald Trump?"It's in the Constitution Earlier this week Trump announced that he would upend the Constitution's 14th amendment and halt birthright citizenship by executive order—sometime.  It's "a desperate midterm election Hail Mary" aimed at anti-immigration voters wrote John Avlon;  ironic to boot "given the conservative movement's obsession with Obama-era executive orders." It won't hold up in court he says.  "I'm a birthright citizen" declared Naaz Modan who rooted in the New Jersey suburbs in the 1980s. "My story and the story of many other first-generation citizens is the American story"—immigrants signing on to "a set of shared ideals—democracy rights liberty opportunity and equality."  She concludes: "It comes as no surprise that a man who called himself a nationalist just one week ago is now undermining these values."Let's pause on that wrote Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony: Trump gets the nationalism vs. globalism issue—"the great political struggle of our age"--exactly right.  Before Hitler gave nationalism a bad name "national independence and self-determination" were seen as "key to a free world... free institutions limited government and personal liberties."

Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter.  We're looking back at the strongest smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. (CNN)Less than 24 hours after authorities arrested a man accused of terrorizing the nation with mail bombs another man shouting anti-Semitic slurs and armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday killing 11 people and injuring six.  The suspect Robert D. Bowers 46 was captured at the synagogue.President Donald Trump called the attack "pure evil" and said "our nation and the world are shocked and stunned by the grief." Then he headed to Illinois for a campaign rally 10 days before the midterm elections. ("I don't want to change our life for somebody that is sick and evil.").The trail of anti-Semitism and other hate speech on the suspect's social-media accounts was a familiar marker of domestic terror wrote Jay Parini. "Racism gathers into its dark embrace haters of every kind. Their victims can be of any minority group -- Jew Muslim Latino black gay." For a country "awash in guns hate erupting into murderous violence is a chronic condition."  And while the President is no anti-Semite his "rhetoric has fueled and empowered racists of every stripe...Americans: wake up please! Remember why we exist at all: we were founded by immigrants fleeing persecution abroad..." Writing in the Washington Post Jennifer Rubin warned of the mainstreaming of right-wing "blood and soil" nationalism in the United States and Europe. The shooter may be responsible for this act of mass murder she wrote but politicians who "celebrate 'nationalism' or declare the United States is a 'Christian nation'... are consciously or unconsciously channeling and amplifying anti-Semitism." Twin terrorsThe slaughter at the Tree of Life Synagogue followed days of anxiety and furious debate over who might have been responsible for sending package bombs to a range of people -- mainly prominent Democrats. On Friday the apparent answer came. Cesar Sayoc a 56-year-old Florida man with a long criminal history was arrested in Plantation Florida and his van plastered with right-wing slogans and pro-Trump stickers was hauled away. President Trump had been complaining on Twitter earlier in the day that "this 'Bomb' stuff" was slowing down Republican momentum in the midterms. He instantly pivoted to condemning "these terrorizing acts" before cameras at the White House praising the speedy work of law enforcement. That was teleprompter Trump talking suggested Paul Waldman in the Washington Post and it didn't last long: "after reading some perfunctory remarks about unity he played the victim saying 'Who gets attacked more than me?'" -- before returning to campaign talking points like his plans to halt the migrant caravan moving through Mexico when it reaches the US border. Wrong threat wrote Julian Zelizer.  "The caravan Americans should be worried about is already here. It is the white van that the alleged attempted mail bomber Cesar Sayoc was driving."  The President errs in focusing on "allegedly dangerous people who are part of the movement of immigrants seeking safety within our borders" when "a real concern for the country should be the potential for violent domestic political extremism to flare among people who live here and who perceive themselves to have an ally in the White House." Indeed despite a brief telepromptered condemnation Wednesday the President had downplayed the steady stream of pipe-bomb packages that had sown terror from New York to southern Florida while some of his supporters pushed the idea that the bombs were a "false flag" sent by liberals to discredit the right. "On his radio show Rush Limbaugh asserted Republicans just don't do this kind of thing" wrote Peter Bergen. "That is simply false ... there is in fact a long history of political violence emanating from the far right."    The suspect's motivation is yet to be spelled out but there was no denying what the targets had in common wrote John Avlon. "They've all been targeted by President Donald Trump and made into bogeymen for the far-right often on Fox News by opinion anchors like Sean Hannity" with astonishing frequency. Since he became President "Trump has attacked CNN 63 times on Twitter ... tweeted attacks on (Hillary) Clinton 109 times ... mentioned (Rep. Maxine Waters) 73 times in speeches press statements and tweets since March of this year" including to call her a "low IQ individual."  Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat urged "reasonable elements within the GOP (to) take a second look at the real-life consequences of the hate speech that has overtaken their party. On this issue breaking with Trump would truly be a civic duty and one that might save American lives and democracy in the future." Hold on wrote David French in the conservative National Review before the arrest of Sayoc: "it's worth repeating that we don't have any evidence at all that Trump's words matter to the bomber. Yet for some regardless of the evidence (that) emerges in the next several days Trump's responsibility will remain an unfalsifiable belief." It will take "moral courage to follow that evidence wherever it takes us -- even to the darkest places in our own political movements."  And former FBI agent Josh Campbell cautioned that "this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It is much larger than partisan politics. This is a serious life-and-death matter of public safety." '"I'm sorry" just doesn't cut it' Megyn KellyIn a panel discussion about Halloween costumes on Tuesday the NBC host Megyn Kelly wondered aloud why blackface would be a bad choice for white people.  "What is racist?" she asked posing one of the most ill-advised rhetorical questions ever. The next day there were reports that she was likely toast at NBC. Kelly apologized.  Too late wrote Roxanne Jones. The former Fox host "fell into the trap ensnaring a lot of undercover bigots in America today. ... They think they can redefine the meaning of racism by arguing that they don't believe in being PC -- which to me means that they want to be free to deny the humanity and equality of others who are not like them." By Friday NBC had dropped Kelly's morning show. But Kelly didn't get a fair shake at NBC wrote Joe Concha in The Hill.  She "never seemed particularly welcome nor given a true chance to succeed." In the end NBC chair Andy Lack "threw Kelly under the bus when things got inconvenient." Course correction? Historian Tim Naftali noted that national polls show that the GOP "now the Trump Party does not represent the desires of a majority of Americans" on the key issues of the day: health care women's rights climate change and immigration. On paper at least November 6 should bring "a major course correction in American politics." But if instead the "outcome of the struggle in the current three-person race among center-left anger Trumpist rage and widespread apathy" is a victorious Trump he warns then "our political system will face its strongest stress test in the modern era." A video that popped up on social media Monday roiled the tight Georgia governor's race. It showed Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams participating in the burning of the state flag at college in 1992. Don't be fooled Jill Filipovic said. The video was "aimed squarely and transparently at riling up a racist base" -- by defending a racist flag. This flag was not "some storied part of Georgia's history" but was adopted in 1956 in response to desegregation. Its Confederate symbol was "a big deliberate and clear middle finger to African-Americans."   Chris Pine shows his all in a Hollywood movie The actor's private parts make a cameo in "Outlaw King" an upcoming Netflix movie about a 14th-century Scottish ruler. To Twitter and the media this is a big deal (or at least no small thing) because as everyone knows women appear frontally nude in movies regularly and men hardly ever. It's a disturbing double standard wrote Holly Thomas but that's not really the point. The outsized furor over "his stripping off ought to be read as a symptom of injustice for all genders in the movie industry" she observed.  Better still "the democratization of nudity on-screen would be hugely advanced by moves toward equality off-screen" -- more women on and off camera and more respect "for all actors who take their clothes off in the line of duty."  Lottery billionaire watch outThe frenzy over the largest-ever Mega Millions jackpot -- $1.537 billion -- ended with the drawing Tuesday of the winning ticket bought in Simpsonville South Carolina. But by week's end no one had claimed the prize. Just as well wrote Kate Maltby: "bear in mind the number of lottery winners who've met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread." There was the guy who won $30 million in Florida in 2006 and was found "buried under a concrete slab" (his girlfriend wanted to manage his winnings herself); and the Powerball winner who blamed his sudden wealth for the drug deaths of his daughter and granddaughter ("I wish that we tore the ticket up").  Says Maltby: "Count your lucky stars and pray that you don't win."  Khashoggi's death awakens a lethargic worldNearly a month ago Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul shook the world out of its "outrage lethargy when it comes to human rights violations" observed author Gayle Lemmon. "What was it about this one horrific tragedy against a blood-soaked collection of so many others that made it stand out?" Lemmon asked. "The world's most vulnerable children face sexual abuse in a refugee camp and barely a reaction is received. Thousands of Yazidis -- among them mothers and children -- remain missing and those who have returned have only tents to call home. But the world has moved on; no one seems to feel they can do much of anything to make a difference for much of anyone."  Sandra Day O'Connor's brave goodbye The first woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced that she is in the early stages of dementia. "After a life of service to justice to women and to those caring for and living with Alzheimer's we owe her our thanks and well wishes for the long goodbye" wrote Jay Newton Small who lost her own father to dementia. O'Connor had stepped down from the court in 2006 to care for her husband who suffering from Alzheimer's forgot her and took up with another woman in his senior community.  "The decision to be public with such a private episode" to raise awareness and confront stigmas about the disease "was very much in line with O'Connor's quiet activism all her life."    ,Opinion
 (CNN)The midterm elections a little more than a month away are a national drama -- with voters deciding whether Republican control of the House and Senate will give way to Democrats who have been hankering for a chance to challenge the priorities and actions of President Donald Trump. But they are also an intensely local story as voters get ready to make their choices in 435 House and 35 Senate races and in 36 gubernatorial contests. We asked commentators to tell us which race they are watching most closely and why. The views expressed are solely their own.Is Ted Cruz Beto-able?The crowds and the media love him. But will Texas voters turn out for Beto O'Rourke?  In November the faceoff to watch will be between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke. This contest could upend the political order in the Lone Star State. And an August NBC News poll showed O'Rourke within 4 points of Cruz.    This race is fascinating because it is the Democrats' best chance in years to turn Texas blue. Democrats have long looked to the state's changing demographics -- Texas is about 40% Hispanic -- with hopes of putting the state into play. However Texas' electorate is not the same as its demographics. In 2016 despite a slight increase from prior elections less than half of the state's eligible Latino voters turned out at the polls. Ironically this race is between one of the country's most prominent Hispanic politicians (Cruz) who supports Trump's wall and admittedly doesn't speak Spanish well and a white upstart (O'Rourke) who is against the wall and fluent en Español. O'Rourke's rise is remarkable considering that he is running as a staunch liberal. He supports gun control the legalization of marijuana and universal health care coverage. What began as a grassroots effort has now garnered such momentum that even Cruz's former campaign spokesman thinks  O'Rourke could pull off an upset victory. O'Rourke comes across as authentic and youthful which is reportedly making Cruz nervous. Still it will take more than viral videos and friendly appearances on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" to put O'Rourke over the top. He remains David to Cruz's Goliath. While O'Rourke's likability factor is huge his effort will hinge on voter mobilization. To win he will have to perform strongly with millennials Latinos and voters in Texas' more liberal cities. In interviews O'Rourke has often asserted that Texas is not a red state it is a nonvoting state. He's got that right -- and so his success will depend on upending this paradigm. Raul A.

Will Arizona elect its first Democratic senator since 1988?With the House expected to fall to Democrats and Republicans expected to keep and possibly even make gains in the Senate sweeping 2020 projections will be tricky to make after these midterms. But I'm watching the Senate race in Arizona with a few things in mind.First putting aside the historic promise of Arizona electing its first woman to the Senate it's possible Arizona is about to elect its first Democrat since 1988. President Donald Trump only won Arizona in 2016 by a little over 3 percentage points -- if Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema pulls out a win over Republican Rep. Martha McSally it will be hard not to see the significance of a reliably red state voting blue.Second if that happens exit polling will be key. Was Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and child separation policy a factor? That specifically will have national implications and might serve as a forecast of his 2020 re-election hurdles among Hispanic voters.Finally if McSally an Air Force veteran wins the significance won't be that a Republican kept the seat red. It will be the kind of Republican who did it. McSally easily beat out Trumpian Kelli Ward in a race that was supposed to send a message to perceived "moderates" like McSally the outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake and even the late Sen. John McCain that their kind has fallen out of favor among conservatives. McSally's win here will prove there's at least some desire for less "Trumpy" Republicans even in a historical red state.  SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and host of "SE Cupp Unfiltered." Mother of a slain young man runs for CongressThe electoral race that most encapsulates the potential of this political moment and the future of politics in our nation is Lucy McBath's contest to unseat Republican incumbent Karen Handel in Georgia's 6th Congressional District just north of Atlanta.Unlike Handel the former secretary of state of Georgia who has taken strong stances against Obamacare and regulations McBath is not a career politician interested in dismantling Washington legislation. She's not even a lifelong activist. She was by her own account just a regular "suburban mom" until her son Jordan Davis was shot and killed outside a gas station in Florida in 2012 in a dispute over playing loud music. Davis is black and the white man who killed him had a conceal carry permit. In that horrific moment McBath became as she told me over the phone recently "a mother on a mission."Speaking out about her son's death and the need for comprehensive solutions to gun violence and systemic racism McBath joined "Mothers of the Movement" women whose black children have been killed by gun violence or the police. McBath also became a national spokeswoman for Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. "Then Parkland happened" McBath explained to me. "Those children were the same age as Jordan when he was murdered." She thought maybe now finally policies would change. But when they didn't McBath took the next big step -- and declared her candidacy for office. McBath represents the moment we are in as a country today -- where more and more people are not only protesting and lobbying against status quo injustices but also transforming their anger into real political power.  "This is our modern day civil rights movement" says McBath.  Yet while progressive movements for change haven't always embraced electoral politics or have been slow to do so the recent surge of multi-issue multiracial progressive protest has quickly focused the movement on political change. Mitt Romney won GA-06 in 2012 by 23 points. But Trump just barely won the district in 2016 by one point. And when Handel won the special election a year ago over Democrat Jon Ossoff the race was still quite close. So McBath has a real shot at victory. But either way she's blazing the trail for ordinary people to become engaged in the political process including running for office. "I intend to win" says McBath "but no matter what happens this is a win-win."Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book "The Opposite of Hate." Will an anti-Trump liberal Democrat win in rural Kentucky?This race in Kentucky's Bluegrass region features a well-funded incumbent Republican Andy Barr running against an outsider Democrat Amy McGrath who easily beat two establishment politicians in her primary. Polls close at 6 p.m. ET and votes are counted quickly in Fayette County (Lexington) the district's largest which means we'll know early whether Barr weathered the stormA Democrat win likely means a big night for their party. The Cook Report rates the district R+9 and Trump won here by more than 15 points. If Democrats are knocking down contested jump shots like this it means the "blue wave" is real.McGrath a former fighter pilot leans on her military credentials to fend off the usual attacks that sink Democrats in Kentucky. Shortly after the May primary internal polling from both parties showed her with a decent lead. But Barr's campaign smartly went on offense in August dropping brutal attack ads featuring audio of McGrath claiming: "I am further left I am more progressive than anyone in the state of Kentucky" a bold statement given Kentucky's only Democratic congressman John Yarmuth is one of the most liberal in Congress.McGrath has been taped at numerous fundraisers staking out liberal positions on abortion and taxes stances better left to campaigns in California than Kentucky. Republicans believe their barrage will have conservative Democrats reaching for the ejection handle on McGrath's bid.  Both parties are all in with donations and outside spending piling up. Can an anti-Trump liberal Democrat win in rural Kentucky? You'll know before dessert on election night.Scott Jennings a CNN contributor is a former special assistant to President George W.

Will the Tennessee Senate race be a referendum on Trump?Keep a close eye on Tennessee where Republican Marsha Blackburn is facing off against Democrat Phil Bredesen a former governor. This race will be a good lens through which to see what kind of damage if any President Donald Trump might be inflicting on the GOP. The state is now in comfortable Republican territory. The GOP has a supermajority in the state House controls seven congressional seats and now holds onto both Senate seats. However a majority of the nation does not approve of how Trump is doing his job with his approval rate hovering in high 30s and low 40s. So how will Trump's tenure impact this partisan dynamic?The Tennessee Senate race to replace Bob Corker pits the popular two-term governor against a Trumpian Republican who elicits the strong support of anti-abortion activists. While Bredesen promises to expand health care access and opposes the Republican tax cuts Blackburn has been a harsh critic of the Affordable Care Act and voted in favor of recent tax cuts.And though Bredesen is an unusually popular Democrat and leading in the latest CNN poll his victory would signal a big chip in the partisan armor of the GOP which would inevitably be blamed on Trump's impact on his own party.While one part of the story in November will revolve around who wins control of Congress another big issue that political observers are watching is whether Trump with his unstable behavior and radical approach to governance will stimulate any sort of backlash within his own party that goes beyond words of reprimand. It would take major midterm losses including defeats that cut deep into Republican territory to push congressional Republicans into actually taking a stand against the President and beginning a soul-searching process. If this Tennessee Senate seat goes blue that would be the kind of outcome that could have a real-world impact on Capitol Hill.Julian Zelizer is a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University editor of "The Presidency of Barack Obama: A First Historical Assessment" and co-host of the "Politics & Polls" podcast. Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizerA Democratic veteran aims to win in Trump countryThere are so many remarkable women and men running for office this year -- Rashida Tlaib Beto O'Rourke Ilhan Omar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- but out of all of them West Virginia's Richard Ojeda might be the one most worth watching. Ojeda voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and now he's the Democratic candidate for his state's 3rd Congressional District. Trump not surprisingly is not his biggest fan -- calling him a "total whacko" at a recent rally in West Virginia.It's a wide-open race: Republican Rep. Evan Jenkins vacated his seat leaving Ojeda to compete against state Rep. Carol Miller. In a district that went for Trump by 50 points Ojeda is polling at 40% to Miller's 48%. And 12% are undecided. If you're wondering why he's got a shot just give him a listen. Ojeda is an emboldened outraged veteran who came back from battle to find his home embattled. While many Americans risked their lives in nations abroad many more struggled in our own nation -- persistent income inequality a disappearing middle class -- and even died as a pernicious opioid epidemic for years went ignored. Yet his opponent doesn't seem to prioritize these issues. Instead Miller makes it clear she endorses Trump -- and that the President endorsed her. She appears concerned with defending the Second Amendment cutting taxes and lining up behind the agenda of the commander-in-chief who Ojeda regrets voting for. Meanwhile Ojeda speaks the story of struggling Americans in a dialect that dyes progressive populism with the hues of a very red state. This explains why in addition to his support for more affordable education comprehensive immigration reform and the decriminalization of medical marijuana he vocally supports West Virginia's coal industry even as he acknowledges the reality of climate change and strives to keep his state competitive through investment in clean and alternative energy sources. Such politics explodes the myth of insurmountable and immutable partisanship. Good for America. But helpful to me too as I find myself increasingly unable to singularly identify as a progressive or a conservative. Ojeda suggests that we don't have to be only and forever Democrats and Republicans that we can grow and mature. And we don't have to be milquetoast centrists. We could refuse the political boundaries imposed on us for what are boundaries but limits and who are Americans except people who refuse to believe anything is impossible?Haroon Moghul is a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy. He is the author of the new book "How to be a Muslim." Will Georgia elect first black female governor?There's a dead heat in Georgia and I'm not talking about the weather. The race for governor of Georgia could not be closer. Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are deadlocked. The latest Real Clear Politics polls shows Kemp at 45% versus Abrams at 45%. In other words Republicans in this center-right red state realize they are in a real fight.It's not hard to see the headwinds on the national level are blowing through the Peach State. The proverbial soccer moms of suburban Atlanta are conflicted with the tone and tenor of President Donald Trump. But there is time for a course correction before Election Day.After all the two candidates could not be more different. Secretary of State Kemp is campaigning on "Putting Georgians First" with a focus on jobs public safety and education. Former State House Minority Leader Abrams -- who could be the first female black governor in the country -- has fully embraced the progressive agenda. Kemp seeks to expand gun rights while Abrams supports gun-control measures. Kemp wants quality affordable private health care for all while Abrams wants to expand Medicaid. Kemp support anti-abortion measures while Abrams wants to protect abortion rights.   Though Abrams is charismatic as a native of Atlanta myself I can say her positions are too extreme for the state. Georgia remains a center-right state. Kemp is a center-right candidate running a center-right campaign. As long as he continues to focus on what's going right with the economy Georgians will come home to the GOP.Alice Stewart is a CNN Political Commentator and former Communications Director for Ted Cruz for President.Familiar third-party candidate challenges status quoThose who aren't on board with President Donald Trump's agenda but just can't bring themselves to support the Democrats have a sliver of hope in New Mexico where former Gov. Gary Johnson a libertarian has entered a three-way race for a US Senate seat.As the Libertarian Party's candidate for president in the 2016 election Johnson earned 3% of the vote  the best finish for a national third-party candidate in 20 years. Still the outcome was something of a disappointment for Johnson who had hoped to capitalize on historic levels of dissatisfaction with the two main party candidates but instead became a punchline after a series of gaffes. (Remember "what is Aleppo?") Afterward he swore he was done with politics.But now Johnson is mounting an unlikely but far from impossible challenge to incumbent Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. A former Republican governor of the typically blue state Johnson is still popular in New Mexico: A recent poll showed Heinrich leading the race at 39% with 21% for Johnson and 11% for Republican Mike Rich. Some 30% are still undecided.Johnson is an economic conservative known for vetoing hundreds of bills during his first term in office. But he's also a social liberal who supports abortion rights immigration and drug legalization. And he's no fan of the President; in fact he said Trump's election "could be the end of the republic as we know it." A good showing for Johnson would be a win for the Libertarian Party while also proving that centrist liberals independents and Never Trump Republicans can find a compromise candidate.Robby Soave writes for the libertarian magazine Reason. Follow him on Twitter @robbysoaveCan a Republican win again in a Clinton district?On November 6 my eyes will be glued to the returns coming in from Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Three features of the race that pits Republican incumbent Will Hurd against Democratic newcomer Gina Ortiz Jones make it especially important. First it's one of the 23 House districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016 but that sent a Republican to Congress. Both parties are laser-focused because it's prime real estate to flip. If the Democrats don't win this district it's hard to imagine a path to majority control in the House of Representatives.Second Gina Ortiz Jones has the candidate profile that seems to be motivating Democratic turnout across the county. She's young. She's gay. She's a woman of color. She's an Iraq War veteran. And she's progressive. If Jones can't turn out the vote then that bodes poorly for Democratic candidates with less compelling personal stories.Third Hurd isn't a Donald Trump acolyte. He differs from the President on DACA and the border wall (not surprising given that the district is 55% Hispanic). And as a former CIA official he has condemned the administration for how it handled Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Hurd poses a challenge for Jones in a way that not all Republicans in similar swing districts do. In short if TX-23 goes blue then it's likely that the wave is nothing short of a tsunami.Jennifer L. Lawless is the Commonwealth Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia.Is Maryland ready for a civil rights leader turned governor?I have known Ben Jealous the Democratic candidate for Maryland governor for 2½ decades. What strikes me most about him: Every week month and year that I have known him he has been passionately working to help people who needed a strong champion. He is known as the youngest ever president of the NAACP a venerable ailing civil rights organization that he fixed and turned around. But he has not helped only African-Americans.Though Jealous is running against Republican candidate Larry Hogan who has tried to distance himself from Trump Jealous' campaign like many this November is about President Donald Trump. And Jealous is everything that Trump is not. Where Trump seeks to divide and cater to a narrow base Jealous has spent his life building diverse coalitions for change in the public and private sector winning major victories for DREAMers the LGBTQ community and abolishing Maryland's death penalty. In the private sector he is an investor who has helped over 20 socially conscious companies launch and grow creating jobs and proving that you don't have to sell your soul to do well in business. He connects as easily with blue-collar white guys as he does with black female churchgoers.Electing a civil rights leader and businessman right on Trump's doorstep would send a huge signal that voters across the country are turning out to resist bigotry division and corrupt government.You don't have to guess what Jealous would do in office. He has been winning real victories for underdogs in every role he has ever played.Van Jones is the host of the #VanJonesShow and a CNN political commentator.

There was a nasty Democratic primary fight that the national party actively engaged in with a ham-handed release of opposition research on the progressive candidate Laura Moser. Ultimately they got what they wanted in Lizzie Fletcher a more moderate nominee who Democratic leadership believes will have a better chance of knocking off a longtime incumbent.And Fletcher is still a young fresh female candidate with a great resume and strong ties to the district. The first test will be whether Democrats coalesce around her candidacy to support her on Election Day like they have in other elections when the more progressive candidate was defeated such as Virginia's governor race last year.Culberson has been in office for almost two decades and he has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act repeatedly an issue that has become the No. 1 topic for Democrats running this fall. If that message works in the Texas suburbs it will be a good sign of its effectiveness in other swing districts.Finally the race also has the potential to benefit from the huge enthusiasm Democratic Senate nominee Beto O'Rourke is generating at the top of the ticket.  Even if he falls short of knocking off sitting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz his impact on the turnout could send Fletcher as well as a handful of other new Democratic members from the deep red state of Texas to Congress.Jen Psaki a CNN political commentator was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration.

Follow her at @jrpsaki.We're in for another Florida nailbiterIt has been 24 long years since Florida voters elected a Democratic governor. But all signs point to a possible history-making victory by the party's nominee Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.The race offers an early test of whether swing states like Florida support President Donald Trump's performance. Gillum a progressive favors single-payer health care and has called for an increase in corporate taxes and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.His Republican rival Ron DeSantis is a fervent Trump supporter riding an endorsement by the President to victory in the Republican primary. While Trump's backing was enough to win over GOP voters the November general election is another matter. Trump carried Florida in 2016 by only 113000 votes a margin of 1.2% of the more than 9 million votes cast.That means the state is up for grabs this year giving Democrats a chance to end their exile from the statehouse.Florida is a true swing state a fact etched in the nation's memory in 2000 when a razor-thin 537-vote margin delivered the state and the presidency to Republican George W. Bush.Since that infamous squeaker the state has seesawed in presidential races supporting Bush again in 2004 then switching to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 before flipping back to the GOP by supporting Donald Trump in 2016.Democrats know that winning the state this year would give the party a head start on trying to carry the state in the 2020 presidential election.Errol Louis is the host of "Inside City Hall" a nightly political show on NY1 a New York all-news channel. Will New Jersey elect its first Republican senator since 1972? The last time Republicans won a Senate race in New Jersey Richard Nixon was president. Over the last 46 years Republicans have found spectacular ways to lose New Jersey Senate races even when the GOP found success in wave election years nationally. They even lost when Ronald Reagan won a landslide re-election victory in 1984. Although New Jersey has been a traditional Democratic stronghold with Democrats outnumbering Republicans by nearly 900000 voters have elected Republican governors over the years. Yet the Senate has eluded the GOP since 1972.Opposite the national trend of Democrats running competitively in Republican leaning districts across the country the New Jersey Senate race may actually be in play in a reliably blue state.  GOP Senate candidate Bob Hugin a wealthy former pharmaceutical executive and former Marine has spent nearly $16 million of his own money attacking incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez as corrupt after his federal corruption trial ended in a mistrial and his severe admonishment by the Senate Ethics Committee. The attacks seem to be working. According to the latest Stockton University poll Menendez's once double digit lead is down to 2 points 45% to 43%. While other Republican candidates across the country pledge their loyalty to President Donald Trump Hugin is taking another approach by declaring himself a "different kind of Republican."

All these positions are at odds with the President who unsurprisingly has a low approval rating within the state.New Jersey's Senate race is probably too close for comfort for Democrats who already have to defend 26 Senate seats 10 in states Trump won in 2016.

Will's Faso's racist Hail Mary pass throw him a lifeline?Every race is critical: Here in California where I live now there are seven key House seats in districts that went blue in November 2016 and any path for Democrats to flip Congress will run through those. But the race I'm tracking most closely is actually in New York my home state albeit in the suburban reaches of upstate surrounding Albany: The dead-heat contest between vulnerable Republican incumbent Rep. John Faso and his Democratic challenger Antonio Delgado. Delgado is an incredibly impressive candidate -- a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar who is running as a moderate progressive. He's also black running in a district that's 84% white. Faso in contrast is a Trump-down-the-line checkbox in the House; until recently he's been best known for voting to kill Obamacare despite vowing to a cancer-patient constituent that he would not compromise her insurance in a video that subsequently went viral. But Faso has a new infamy attached to his name: Pressured by polls showing that Delgado was tied or even ahead in the race the National Republican Congressional Committee released a disgusting deeply coded campaign ad that uses clips from Delgado's youthful flirtation with hip-hop (rapping under the handle "AD the Voice") as evidence that Faso's challenger was out of step with the values of the district and "unfit" to serve as their representative. The race-baiting led The New York Times to run an editorial condemning Faso. Other publications have followed suit.With any luck Faso's racist Hail Mary won't throw him a lifeline but an anvil. Given the demographics of the district and the nature of the race if Delgado wins it will be part of an overwhelming blue sweep of the midterm elections. Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion a featured writer for Quartz and other publications and the co-host of the podcast "They Call Us Bruce."Correction: An earlier version of this article attributed the ad about Antonio Delgado to John Faso's campaign. However the National Republican Congressional Committee is responsible for it. It also referred to the race as the New York Ninth but it is the New York Nineteenth.

(CNN)Republicans seem worried about the prospect of their Judiciary Committee members questioning Christine Blasey Ford when she testifies on Thursday about her sexual assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an allegation the nominee denies. They are concerned about the optics of having only Republican men interviewing Ford since there are no Republican female senators on the Judiciary Committee. And now according to The New Yorker a classmate of Kavanaugh's at Yale Deborah Ramirez has come forward with an additional allegation of inappropriate sexual behavior by Kavanaugh -- which Kavanaugh has also denied. (CNN so far has not spoken to anyone who is willing to corroborate Ramirez's story.)In the face of these two allegations Republicans are right to be worried. The Republican Party's stock with women voters in the midterms -- and beyond -- is at stake.  In July when Kavanaugh's nomination was announced a Morning Consult/Politico poll suggested a slight plurality of voters supported his confirmation. And in a July Fox News poll 38% of voters said they would vote to confirm Kavanaugh while 32% said they would not confirm him and 30% were undecided.  But in polling conducted in the days after Ford made her allegations public the numbers had shifted -- and not in Kavanaugh's favor. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll more American voters now oppose Kavanaugh's nomination than support it. In that poll 38% of voters oppose Kavanaugh's confirmation while just 34% support it.That's a problem for Trump and Republicans in general but especially when it comes to women. As NBC reports "The increased opposition to Kavanaugh has come in particular from women over 50 (who were +3 on Kavanaugh's confirmation in August and are -7 now) (and) suburban women (-6 in August and -11 now)." The divide is still largely partisan. Republican women actually increased their support for Kavanaugh between August and the recent allegations while Democratic women decreased their support. But most significantly independent women had net support of 1% for Kavanaugh in August; they're now net opposed by 13%.  All this is before Christine Blasey Ford has even testified -- or been cross-examined by the Republican Judiciary Committee's flank of all men some of whom have suggested that Kavanaugh should be confirmed no matter what Ford says. "I'll listen to the lady but we're going to bring this to a close" said Sen. Lindsey Graham R-South Carolina. Later Graham added "Unless there's something more no I'm not going to ruin Judge Kavanaugh's life over this."  And Sen. Orrin Hatch R-Utah said that even if Ford's allegations were true "I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today" insisting that Kavanaugh is "a really good man."Still it will be hard not to view the way these men handle the accusations as a proxy for their party as a whole. And in recent days GOP politicians haven't helped their cause. Just consider Republican Rep. Ralph Norman joking that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was groped by Abraham Lincoln or Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher suggesting that even if Kavanaugh assaulted Ford it was back in high school so "Give me a break."  I don't think women in either party will take well to Republican men making light of serious allegations of sexual assault. Of course many of these same women voted for our current President who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women himself -- accusations which he too denies.  But will they keep overlooking the Republican Party's seemingly pervasive culture of misogyny? And how many other women will be newly motivated or extra motivated to kick the Grand Old Party out of office and replace them with candidates especially female candidates who take sexual assault claims seriously?  President Donald Trump was already slipping in his approval numbers among the white women voters who played a key role in his electoral college victory. For instance Ron Brownstein observes in the Atlantic "Compared to his 2016 vote his 2017 approval among blue-collar white women in the Rust Belt represented some of his largest declines anywhere -- 18 percentage points in Ohio and 19 in Wisconsin and Minnesota."And these latest allegations won't help Trump or his party's approval ratings -- unless Republicans take Ford and Ramirez's allegations seriously. To treat both women with respect and take the time needed to investigate is not a rush to judgment. This is about preserving the integrity of our Supreme Court and also sending a message to all Americans that sexual assault of any kind at any age is not okay. Republicans should handle this situation the right way because it's the right thing to do for our democracy and our society and our women. But Washington being Washington that's not always motivation enough.  Too many Republican politicians remain in the dark ages when it comes to even the most basic dynamics of gender equity and liberation. Botch this any further and the whole party could be cast into political darkness for generations.   ,Opinion
Michael D'Antonio is author of the book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Donald Trump seems determined to replicate in a few short years as President all of the Washington scandals of the past 50 years from Watergate to the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings to the Hurricane Katrina debacle.Case in point: After first showing unusual restraint when Christine Blasey Ford came forward to say that she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh -- a claim he denies -- when the current Supreme Court nominee was a 17-year-old prep school student Trump on Friday did his best to own the controversy. He tweeted:"I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date time and place!"Comparisons to the Clarence Thomas crisis of the George H. W. Bush administration are inevitable even though Bush himself did not behave as Trump has. Trump had no way of knowing about Blasey Ford's allegation of Kavanaugh when he nominated the judge for the Supreme Court but the President's handling of the matter has made it much worse. He has insulted her by calling her "the woman" and instead of asking the FBI to investigate as Bush did with Thomas he has said such probes are "not the FBI's thing." This is false.     Of course every scandal is unique so exact comparisons to the woes of earlier presidents cannot be drawn.  But the echoes are unmistakable  and have become impossible to ignore.Trump's response to the Kavanaugh situation may not be quite as bad as his reaction to the study that concluded that nearly 3000 people died because of Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico last year.  The President has said that he thinks the tally is false and was developed as a political attack. Puerto Rico has accepted the findings.With Maria already regarded as his version of President George W. Bush's slow response to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Trump's complaint confirmed that his hurricane debacle was proof of his cluelessness as well as his incompetence.Then of course there is the Russia investigation where the prosecution of Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn brings to mind the classic Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon.  Lesser quagmires have swallowed many of Trump's appointees.Among them: Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned amid ethical scandals; former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price who resigned when his use of private jets at taxpayer expense was revealed; and Rob Porter a White House staff secretary who resigned when domestic abuse allegations surfaced. Porter has denied the allegations. Remarkably only one administration official former national security adviser Flynn has been removed from office because of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But here again Trump in on pace to outperform four decades' worth of presidents. One has to go back more than 40 years to Nixon and Watergate to find as much evidence of campaign-related scandal as has been revealed during the Trump presidency.Campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents investigating the Russia scandal. In addition to Manafort the campaign chairman special counsel Robert Mueller had obtained a guilty plea from Rick Gates who served in the Trump campaign and in the transition. Michael Cohen who bragged about being the President's "fixer" has pleaded guilty to crimes related to buying the silence of Karen MacDougal and Stormy Daniels Trump's alleged extramarital sexual partners in order to aid the Trump campaign. Trump has denied the affairs.Daniels is suing Trump and her lawyer Michael Avenatti is seeking a sworn deposition from the President.  Avenatti is making the same demand on behalf of another client Summer Zervos who was among a number of women who have alleged sexual harassment by Trump. Trump has denied the allegations of the women including Zervos. Her defamation complaint has already put Trump in the position of having to answer written questions.   The peril Trump faces in the Daniels and Zervos matters appears similar to the presidential deposition in the Paula Jones civil suit which was a turning point in the scandal that enveloped Clinton in the late 1990s. Clinton's evasions and lying led to an impeachment trial. (Under oath during a deposition Clinton said that he did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.) He escaped being removed from office following a trial in the US Senate.Most of Trump's problems including the controversy affecting the Kavanaugh nomination have recent historical precedent but the number of crises impacting his administration does not. Trump's record is all the more striking because he follows a President Barack Obama who suffered only one cabinet resignation due to controversy -- former CIA Director David Petraeus who resigned after an FBI investigation confirmed that he was having an affair with his biographer -- in eight years.  Coming after No Drama Obama as he was called Trump has been one-man chaos machine.At the White House  insiders have been so aghast at Trump that in the words of the anonymous writer who penned the recent article in The New York Times  "many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office."Indeed the man who says he knows how to find and hire the best people has presided over a team in constant turmoil.  The appointees who stand between Trump and his worst instincts recognize what many of us feel. They and we don't need a complete accounting of the debacles to conclude that a temperamentally intellectually and morally unfit man occupies the Oval Office.,Opinion
This article is the first in a series of three by Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner the authors of the new book "The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence." The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)Now familiar as a smiling nodding presence at the President's side Mike Pence was little known outside of his home state of Indiana when Donald Trump selected him as his running mate in 2016. A bit more than two years later as he crisscrosses America to campaign for Republicans in the midterm elections Pence is setting himself up to replace his boss if Trump leaves office early or does not seek re-election. "Mike will be ready" is the line Pence's aides and allies use as they contemplate his place in a post-Trump world.   Pence would never admit this. He plays the part of unctuous toady so fully that the conservative writer George Will called him "America's most repulsive public figure." But don't be fooled. The vice president is doggedly pursuing his own ambitions on the side. The Oval Office has been his goal since high school. He has seeded the federal government with his loyalists and is building his own nationwide political organization. He is acting in fact as if he is on a mission from God. Some may laugh but many conservative Christians believe that God is merely using Trump to prepare the way for a so-called true man of faith. Pence's rise to power would affirm the "Cyrus prophecy" which became a popular notion among Christian right circles when Pence joined the 2016 ticket.Cyrus was a Persian king whom the Old Testament credits with returning the Jews to Jerusalem. He was a pagan who nevertheless served God. Right-wing evangelists such as Lance Wallnau cited that tale in 2016 when they declared that Trump --  a profane and sinful man -- could nevertheless do God's work and was thus worthy of conservative Christian votes. An estimated 80% of white evangelicals gave Trump their votes. The story of Cyrus resonates with many right-wing Christians because they imagine themselves to be persecuted like the Jews of old. Despite their vast wealth power and numbers these believers cite developments such as same-sex marriage and the use of ecumenical phrases such as "happy holidays" instead of Merry Christmas as evidence they are a minority under siege. They imagine themselves to be victims of a culture war and feel that something must be done to defend an old order that they once dominated. As a radio host member of Congress and then governor of Indiana Pence made himself the most successful conservative Christian politician of his generation. Indeed he says he is "a Christian a conservative and a Republican in that order." During 12 years in Congress he never authored a single bill but he did become a prominent advocate for banning abortion defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting marriage only to heterosexual couples. In his one term as governor he overstepped when he signed a bill -- the so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- permitting discrimination against gay people and was forced to seek a change in the law.  His rhetoric attacking abortion rights adultery and even evolution (he says he doesn't believe in it) assured the Christian right that he was one of them.   When Trump offered Pence his spot on the ticket the Republican Party's evangelical wing was over the moon.  Pence was also a first-term governor facing a tough battle for re-election despite a longstanding and substantial GOP advantage in voter registration. His outspoken support for the Religious Freedom Restoration Act had alienated some centrist Republicans and though Pence was genial enough he was not the kind of campaigner who got folks fired up.   Offered a path out of struggling obscurity in Indiana Pence didn't need a Bible prophecy to tell him it was OK to take the leap. He hitched his pious ambitions to a crude twice-divorced self-confessed sexual predator whose grasp of faith and Scripture appears nonexistent. Pence's favorite Bible verse reads: "For I know the plans I have for you plans to prosper you and not harm you plans to give you hope and a future." He cites it when he discusses the opportunities that come his way and to explain the confidence he brings to politics.Pence's theology says that God selects in advance which individuals will become believers and rewards their faith regardless of what they do. This belief allows for all sorts of bad behavior if it can be framed as supporting the ultimate goal of promoting the evangelical agenda.     Pence's loyalty to the President even after the "Access Hollywood" tape exposed Trump as a serial sexual harasser  baffled many. It was reported at the time that Pence considered trying to replace Trump at the top of the ticket but in the end he held his place and his tongue. Pence's religion explains that choice and his decision to abandon many of his previous positions on the issues such as his opposition to banning Muslim visitors to America.To understand how a seemingly pious politician such as Pence could join Trump and stick with him requires tracing the long path of his ambition. Pence wasn't always the rigidly moralistic and confident conservative evangelical he professes to be today.  But he was from the beginning of his adult life a man who thought he was destined for the presidency.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)The way in which America -- for years a self-proclaimed role model for human rights -- projects its values to the rest of the world has real tangible effects on the global stage. In the age of Donald Trump the US State Department has turned its back on the fight against racism and xenophobia. Even worse the agency seeks to remove anti-racist language from international documents. The US government has a racism issue and it is a dangerous problem with international implications.In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo six House Democrats said they are "extremely alarmed" the administration has remained silent regarding racism and xenophobia in international fora and has not condemned hate speech and incitement. They also noted that Andrew Veprek the deputy assistant secretary for refugees and migration rejected the notion that leaders have a "duty to condemn hate speech and incitement" and according to a report by CNN Veprek sought changes to UN human rights documents that denounce racism as a threat to democracy."The drafters say 'populism and nationalism' as if these are dirty words" Veprek wrote of one document. "There are millions of Americans who likely would describe themselves as adhering to these concepts. (Maybe even the President.) So are we looking to here condemn our fellow-citizens those who pay our salaries?" Further Veprek took issue with language in a UN Human Rights Council resolution which said national leaders have a duty to condemn hate speech. Veprek insisted that "'duty to condemn' goes too far. Our public figures can't be obliged to police every intolerant thought out their (sic) at the risk of being condemned for intolerance themselves.""This is dangerous policy" the lawmakers wrote to Pompeo. And they are right.These members of Congress are justifiably angry over America's retreat from world leadership under this President and "his racist and xenophobic policies have slammed America's door on some of the world's most desperate people" the Democrats wrote. "Ultimately this latest blunder amplifies the increasingly widespread perception that some officials in the Trump administration are racist and support an anti-foreigner anti-Muslim discriminatory agenda and further erodes our credibility on the world stage."    However outrageous the actions words and silence of the Trump White House on hate and intolerance the current situation is by no means surprising.Since President Trump once said that there were "some very fine people on both sides" when referring to violent white supremacists and Nazis marching with tiki torches in Charlottesville Virginia last year why would he downplay racism on the world stage?In his interview this past July with The Sun a British tabloid Trump decried immigration saying that migrants have "changed the fabric of Europe.""And I don't mean that in a positive way" he said. "I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very very sad. I think you're losing your culture. Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago."Trump has turned his beliefs into policy. Although the President hasn't released a statement about Veprek's comments the administration announced its withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council shortly after his proposed language changes.And some of Trump's current and former staff and advisers have been accused of neo-Nazi affiliations Islamophobia and having ties to white nationalists and white supremacists. These people have the ear of the President and are shaping foreign policy and immigration policy.Stephen Miller a White House adviser who is instrumental in immigration policy played a part in the administration's  Muslim travel ban and separating undocumented migrant children and parents from each other. He is also involved in plans to limit citizenship for documented immigrants and strip immigrants of their citizenship.Richard Grenell US ambassador to Germany faced calls for his expulsion for telling the alt-right white nationalist website Breitbart that he wanted to "empower" anti-establishment conservatives in Europe. Ronald Vitiello acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently attended an annual conference of the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform. At its conference this month the anti-Muslim group ACT for America honored former ICE Director Thomas Homan.In Trump hard-right politicians around the world seem to have found a common ground and have become more emboldened with their own racist and xenophobic policies and rhetoric.Russian President Vladimir Putin has cultivated ties with white nationalist politicians and groups in Europe and the United States. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a Trump cheerleader who supports hardline anti-immigration policies. Conte's interior minister has called for a census of the country's Roma people an ethnic group in order to expel them. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has found a friend in Trump and has enacted anti-immigrant "Stop Soros" laws to criminalize anyone who helps an undocumented immigrant file an asylum claim. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has called for an anti-migration axis with Germany and Italy. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted his country's own wall on the southern border with Egypt to keep out African "illegal infiltrators" who he said are worse than Sinai terrorists and threaten the livelihood of Israel's Jewish majority. Netanyahu's racist nation-state law declares self-determination for the Jewish people and encourages segregated communities but omits any mention of equality and minority group rights. Thanks to a government that has abdicated its leadership on the fight against hate America's positive role on the international stage is diminishing. How can the United States ever hope to combat racism in the world when its leader seems to be helping to spread it?,Opinion

A President who boasted about sexual assault has nominated a judge for an empty Supreme Court seat -- and a woman has accused that judge of physical and sexual assault an accusation he vehemently denies. The outcome of the hearings could decide the fate of women's bodily autonomy for the foreseeable future.Initially Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have tried to persuade Trump to nominate two other judges instead of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Why? Because according to the New York Times McConnell was concerned about Kavanaugh's long paper trail which includes millions of pages detailing his time on the bench and working in the George W. Bush White House. McConnell according to sources who briefed the Times had little desire to revisit the Bush-era controversies including the use of enhanced interrogation techniques -- aka torture -- which Kavanaugh upheld the use of in several cases. And though McConnell lost that battle his party quickly united around Kavanaugh moving his confirmation process along at warp speed. Shortly after Senator Dianne Feinstein the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee referred the woman's allegation of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court nominee to the FBI Republican Chuck Grassley chair of the Judiciary committee released a letter in which 65 women vouched for Kavanaugh's character in high school. This potentially indicates that after a rushed confirmation hearing process some within the Republican Party may have known of this allegation and moved forward with his nomination nonetheless. If so this further proves that Senate Republicans are utterly out of step with the #MeToo generation.Going forward Republicans are faced with a spectrum of terrible options. They could continue to rush through the confirmation process and attempt to discredit the alleged victim -- Christine Blasey Ford a professor in California who offered the Washington Post a detailed account of what she describes as her traumatic experience and its aftermath and even passed a polygraph test administered by a former FBI agent.If they do so they may lose crucial Republican votes which they cannot afford in the current 51-49 split. If they don't lose enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh Republicans may pay the price this November thanks to a fired up Democrat electorate and already growing group of disgruntled independents. Meanwhile the endless onslaught of scandals could depress the turnout of even dyed-in-the wool Republican women.Their other option is to slow down the confirmation process and allow Ford to testify about her experience which will offer the nation a test -- to see how far we've come since the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings 27 years ago. At that time an all-male Senate judiciary committee ruled in favor of Thomas and dismissed the accusations of Hill a Yale-educated law professor who had accused Thomas of sexual harassment while they worked at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Notably Hill has called for a "fair and neutral" process to investigate the claim against Kavanaugh. Ford's testimony could stand as a harrowing indictment of Kavanaugh's abject unfitness to sit on the Supreme Court. After all her allegation is not one of a merely inappropriate comment but of sexual assault. If true in a just world the price for allegedly holding a girl down attempting to remove her clothes turning up music so no one can hear her protests and muffling her screams until she manages to escape should be quite high.Furthermore if Republican senators attempt to impugn her character they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the American people. Public opinion however is unlikely to view his alleged crime with such clemency. Yes Republicans could gamble that the nation that heard the "Access Hollywood" tape and still elected Donald Trump will vote this November in favor of his party. While Trump didn't deny the statements on the tape he did deny he put his words into action. However at least 15 women have accused Trump of much more than sleazy words -- and he has denied each allegation. And yes Kavanaugh denies the accusation that was made against him when he -- unlike Trump -- was still a minor. That said the allegation against Kavanaugh is far more severe -- it's based on action not just words -- and is more likely to ignite the civic passions of people who may have sat out the last election because they did not feel enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton. Anyone can make unfounded allegations to try and thwart someone's career and if it isn't true the person shouldn't be summarily dismissed. However if further testimony corroborates Ford's claim the only way Republicans stand a chance in the upcoming elections and in the judgment of history is to take an unequivocal stand against predators on the Supreme Court and in the White House.,Opinion
Gene Seymour is a film critic who has written about music movies and culture for The New York Times Newsday Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)When we watch movies we're tempted to take what they say in one ear and out the other because we're there to look more than listen.  Screenwriters know this and as with anybody compelled to hold up their end of a conversation they seek ways to attract attention. Their names alone aren't going to do it so they find attention and at times immortality through a line or two that sticks in an audience's collective memory bank. Consider for instance: "Gentlemen you can't fight in here. This is the War Room!" from "Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964). The line is credited to Terry Southern who won literary notoriety for such satiric novels as "The Magic Christian" and "Candy" but whose "War Room" joke I bet is remembered by many more people.William Goldman who died Friday in New York at age 87 also started out as a novelist publishing five novels before he turned 33. But though he went on to publish other books of fiction and nonfiction Goldman will be remembered more for his Oscar-winning screenplays for "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and "All the President's Men" (1976). Goldman was a virtuoso of pithy dialogue that flowed with sharp tangy momentum. At its most limber and colorful the repartee in a Goldman script allowed plenty of room for memorable lines to leap happily into spectators' ears and stay there.  When in "Butch Cassidy" Sundance (Robert Redford) confesses that he can't leap into a river from a high cavern because he can't swim Butch (Paul Newman) laughs and says "Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill ya!" (Of course they jump.)  And whatever else you want to say about "Butch/Sundance" (that year's highest-grossing film despite mixed reviews) you have to believe that a writer has to have a pretty good sense of pacing and hearing to leave audiences repeating long afterward the fugitive heroes' bemused query "Who are those guys?" Maybe you had to be there to appreciate the full impact of "Butch/Sundance." But Goldman definitely had enough of a touch to resonate through at least two decades of prolific scripting -- whether they involved adapting his own novels ("Marathon Man" "Magic" "Heat") other people's novels ("Harper" "The Stepford Wives" "Misery" "Absolute Power") original stories either made up ("The Great Waldo Pepper") or real life ("All the President's Men" "Chaplin").  These and many others including several he wasn't even credited for have their fans. But since I have the floor I will declare that "The Princess Bride" Goldman's 1987 adaptation of his 1973 fantasy-quest novel represents his single finest achievement. I don't think I'm alone in falling for "Princess Bride's" combination of winking slapstick high adventure enchanting romance and whimsical invention.  And it doesn't just have memorable lines. Even the way one says the single word "Inconceivable!" (as blurted by Wallace Shawn in the film) can expose a "Princess Bride" devotee. If you look for it there's a video of contemporary Hollywood A-listers from Nicole Kidman Steve Carell Emma Stone to Jake Gyllenhaal Jessica Chastain and Emma Thompson quoting great hunks of dialogue from "Princess Bride." (Says Kidman wistfully: "I just want a man to say 'As you wish' " as Cary Elwes' hero says those words in the film.)  Goldman made such eternal magic look easy. And he insisted it was easy (sort of) saying screenwriting was more of a craft compared with the artistry involved in writing novels or composing poetry. What wasn't easy however was being able to make his professional way through the often-impenetrable thickets of the movie industry. The process of dealing with wave upon wave of producers directors agents stars and other Hollywood field workers led Goldman to some rueful hard-won and caustic conclusions about the film business one of which he famously summed up in "Adventures in the Screen Trade" (1983) one of a handful of wise juicy insider accounts of show business.  "Nobody knows anything" he wrote. "Not one person in the entire motion picture field knows for a certainty what's going to work. Every time out it's a guess and if you're lucky an educated one." To repeat: "Nobody knows anything." As noted earlier the man could come up with a snappy line that lasts a long time.  ,Opinion

View more opinion articles on CNN (CNN)"I've been hearing from people a lot about this story. They are saying 'I am upset this is hurting me.' It is people's lives and it is upsetting that people are having their lives attacked just so this man can exercise his latest obsession."So said Jane Fae writer and campaigner for the rights of LGBT people and women when I spoke to her on Tuesday about Emile Ratelband the 69-year-old Dutchman who has embarked on a new venture to have his age legally changed to 49. Ratelband -- who describes himself as a "positivity guru" -- has heavily referenced the trans movement in his arguments protesting:  "We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?" Well lots of reasons. But when Fae who is a trans woman met Ratelband on the BBC morning news program "Victoria Derbyshire" to discuss them on Monday Ratelband interrupted her so much that she was unable to finish many of her sentences. So I called her up to hear the rest of what she had to say. "Emile talks of trans being a feeling which it is in the sense I describe" explained Fae during our chat. "But underpinning that 'feeling' is a well-documented and defined phenomenon recognized and researched by medical professionals for decades affecting hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of people. "That is very different to a feeling expressed by a lone individual with a track record of pursuing one fad after another for a few months at a time and piggybacking issues in an apparent attempt to raise his media profile." This is indeed not the first time Ratelband whose bid for youth has garnered worldwide coverage has made a swift -- and shallow -- dive into a new venture. In 2003 Ratelband started his own political party The Ratelband List which was based on the model of the Islamophobic Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn. The Ratelband List took part in the elections for the Dutch House of Representatives on January 22 2003 but failed to win a single seat. Since then nothing has been heard of the party. During the BBC interview and in many others he has consistently framed his urge to change his age as a choice referring to his "free will" and complaining that his chronological age of 69 was damaging his chances on the dating app Tinder."I am not an old man I am a wise man" he told Fae at the BBC. "Always I have to defend myself I have to lie about my age." Perhaps he is unaware of -- or unwilling to pay up for -- the upgraded version of Tinder on which you can conceal your vintage.It is incredibly obvious that Ratelband has given no serious thought to his proposal that people be designated a "biological" rather than a chronological age. Reverse engineer his idea a second -- are 45-year-olds who aren't in great shape to be declared "actually 65?" And while he claims he would be happy to give up his pension if he legally became 49 would he be happy for those "new" 65-year-olds to claim one?All of the prejudice Ratelband has complained of is theoretical rather than born of lived personal experience. He has bemoaned the fact that it is harder for old people to get a mortgage (he has one) and a job (he has one of those too). He has seven children already and is expecting an eighth with a surrogate. "For me the following applies: not the burden of the woman but the lusts of the children" he told the AD.It is strange also that as someone so apparently exercised about the stigma older people face he has made no effort whatsoever to tackle it so that others may benefit. Mortgage companies for example are most interested in the number of years you are likely yet to live which would not change if one was assigned a new number. And the people who are stigmatized by age are mostly women. But Ratelband's solution to the problems of age it seems is simply not to be old. And his advocacy is focused exclusively on himself."He was someone I thought I might sympathize with" Fae told me. "But (during the BBC interview) he very quickly moved into my space effectively erasing me and Victoria the whole studio thing was all about him. Every time I made a point he reverted to his. That's his whole politics it's about moving into someone's space and erasing them."Ratelband's insistence on comparing his own situation with the trans movement is not just offensive. It highlights the inadequacies of his argument. It is not necessary to say that trans discrimination is "like" other forms of discrimination because it has a nuance and well-documented history in and of itself. Furthermore while changing his age would apparently lessen the prejudice Ratelband feels he faces transitioning can have the exact opposite effect. People who transition are likely to face at the very least prejudice and at worst physical violence. But the urge to do so is so strong that people proceed despite this. "I would have done anything and everything to transition once I knew I could" Fae explained. "It was overwhelmingly impossible not to."This distinction seems utterly lost on Ratelband who for all his protestations that he is a "wise man" exhibits a depth of thought comparable to one of his political heroes: Donald Trump. He claims that Trump is a "new" kind of person unrestricted by the limitations placed on previous Presidents.Ratelband has conveniently ignored the administration's attacks on transgender people instead gushing in an interview with the Washington Post that POTUS "is just himself." "Trump is the first one who is honest. He shows his emotion on Twitter saying to everyone 'shut up.' He's a new kind of person."Trump isn't "new" though. And neither is Ratelband. Both represent a very old tedious form of white male privilege whose response to not getting precisely what they want no matter how inane is to stomp their feet and talk over everyone else. Neither exhibits any shame as they claim victimhood for things which they are not victims of and neither has any regard for the consequences of their actions for other people. An Arnhem court is expected to rule on Ratelband's case within a few weeks. Let us hope it tells him to start behaving like an adult and leaves his age unchanged.,Opinion
Tess Taylor is the author of the poetry collections "Work & Days" and "The Forage House." The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. This is an updated version of an op-ed that ran originally in response to earlier fires this past August. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)This morning by the time I woke up the sun was already an eerie red. As they have for days friends had already posted pictures to Instagram of the eerie sky out over the San Francisco Bay: a hazy blanket all the hills and bridge obscured. Outside it's smoky and cold. As I went out to get the paper I could feel a familiar phlegmy rattle in my lungs -- the low-level irritation of living with bad air. What's more I recognized all these things from last year at this time. As I packed the kids' lunch I called to my husband about items we need to put in the go box. The air purifier has been running for days. The kids have been going to school but hunkering inside -- no recess for a week. My daughter has a rattly cough. Our ER is full of kids in respiratory distress. Every time we go out we have to weigh whether or not and how much it will hurt. When I run errands each day I can see that our dashboard is covered in a fine sheet of pale ash. It is indeed fire season again and although right now none of the fires are close to us the smoke is drifting over us from so many directions -- from the Camp Fire from the Woolsey Fire. So much of California is up in smoke and rain a ways off yet. The air quality maps show bad air for hundreds of miles in each direction. There's no wind. There are predictions of rain on the horizon -- we scour the weather sites hopefully but for now the chilly air is poison and stagnant. Where we live we aren't scared for ourselves -- not actively at least not compared to last year when we were just downwind of the Sonoma fires. Our friends lost homes and we all inhaled thick smoke for weeks aware that because we live near a chain of refineries in the wrong circumstances our area could become unlivable in a matter of hours. Over the years we have turned that terror into a kind of preparedness: we've researched air masks bought and stored canned food packed a box of things to grab and labeled even that box with what last minute items (computers and some kids toys and passports) we'd throw in if we had time to spare. All of this is to say I'm not surprised the air is bad or that it's fire season. This is not an essay about being startled by the apocalyptic. But this year's apocalypse has gone on for a week and is predicted to go on at least a week longer. I do want to note that. I do want to say to anyone listening: this year's apocalypse is worse than last year's apocalypse. And what I recognized in myself this year -- even as this past week of bad air has passed -- has been a strange terrible low-level resignation rattling around in me like the low burning in my lungs. It was a sad thought; this is how it is now and that in fact the fire seasons of this year and years to come are likely to get worse as the climate warms as we go on having summer after summer of record heat.Meanwhile there's no help coming from on high: we're breathing wave after wave of smoke-filled air just as at a moment when the Trump administration ignores dire climate reports arriving on his desk -- promising us only air that is more polluted more full of carbon. Air that is which will keep warming the planet further which in turn will leave us more and more prone to fires like the ones raging around us..We've had fires in California forever of course -- the Native Americans here did controlled burns to manage our dry hills and the old growth redwood trees we live near are formed and scarred in fire.  The seeds of the mighty sequoia trees that people flock from around the world to see won't even germinate unless  a wildfire comes through to clear the forest floor. What's changing though is the annual scale and intensity of these fires from any seasons of our lifetime. And what's changed as well is the sense that the people in power are managing our ecosystem with any thought or care for our well-being.  This year's fires despoil cities and towns and animal habitat and send huge dark plumes into the air even as Trump administration uses phony logic to roll back emissions standards on freeway vehicles and uses phony economic studies to justify mining and logging in national monument lands. We breathe in the bad air in an era in which we are daily subjected to nonexistent farcical or inane environmental policy.  Coughing I thought of the line from the Auden poem "The Shield of Achilles": "they were small/ and could not hope for help and no help came." It's not of course that hope or help are impossible.  I just read a piece about a waste-to-energy facility in the Netherlands one that makes leaps forward in both generating clean energy and getting carbon out of the atmosphere. I took comfort in the idea that somewhere on the planet people are putting in place the kind of real and practical solutions to climate change and pollution that maybe one day with some luck we in the United States may be able to implement.Meanwhile for this year I feel grimly resigned to the apocalyptic nature of these hotter longer and more frequent fires.  For the foreseeable future no help is coming not from the top; nor from an EPA or an Interior Department that would strip us of national lands for logging and mining not from an administration that rolls back even the simplest protection for bees; for marine sanctuaries; for air and water standards; that seems content to let corporations poison us if it would make them richer. An administration that is set on the short-term goal of removing any regulation that might stop a few rich people from padding their pockets -- all at the expense of the rest of us. It was a sad lonely realization one that people say in Flint Michigan must have had about their state government a long time ago. As I thought about it this morning I realized I'm angry but also aware -- for now for this year the challenge is just to keep remembering that we deserve so much better. I said to my husband: "It's only going to get worse for a while so doublecheck the air masks." Listening to myself I couldn't help but consider that it felt like a small metaphor for surviving the Trump era. I dusted the ash off our car and took my daughter to school. ,Opinion
Kate O'Neill who has an MFA in creative writing and lives in Philadelphia is the oldest sister of Madelyn Linsenmeir. The obituary she wrote for Maddie published in Seven Days last month became a virally shared article. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.  (CNN)Time is behaving strangely these days. I'm told that is one of the side effects of grief -- days muddled by sadness and pierced by moments so unbearable they bring me literally to my knees general confusion over what time it is when to eat or sleep. But I'm always aware of how long it has been since my sister Madelyn Ellen Linsenmeir died. As I write this I've lived 39 days in a world that doesn't include the beautiful girl who wanted to star in Broadway musicals and had a voice that made you believe it was possible. I know it's been nearly a month since the obituary I wrote for her was read and shared by people around the world. It was 14 years ago that my sister took a pill at a party and loved the way it made her feel and 12 years since she started injecting heroin to satisfy the addiction that blossomed from that one pill.  That pill was OxyContin the brand name of a sustained-release formulation of the opiate-based painkiller oxycodone. While my sister tried it recreationally as a teenager more than 14 million prescriptions for OxyContin were written in 2001 and 2002 alone often by doctors who had been falsely led to believe it was less addictive than other painkillers. By the time my sister tried OxyContin in 2004 it was one of the most commonly abused prescription opioids in the US. Purdue Frederick Company an affiliate of Purdue Pharma the drug manufacturer that first produced OxyContin eventually pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misleadingly advertising the drug but was still allowed to sell it. By 2017 the overall opioid prescribing rate in the US was more than 58 prescriptions per 100 people with enough opioid prescriptions in 16% of US counties for every single person to have one. If those pills were seeds the fruit they bore was a bounty crop: more than 2 million people are addicted to opioids and countless more are directly or indirectly affected by the disease. I may not be able to keep track of the days or hours right now but I know it is time to hold accountable the politicians who have stood by and allowed this crisis to take place.We call it the Opioid Epidemic but that useless phrase doesn't describe what is happening to actual human beings in communities across our country. It should be called the My Beautiful Little Sister Lost Custody of Her Son Stole From and Conned People Was Raped and Burned With Cigarettes Tried to Commit Suicide Had Sex for Drugs and Money Went to Jail Was Homeless and Ultimately Lost Everything Including Her Own Life Epidemic. Or the Thousands and Thousands of People Are Dying While Drug Companies Make Billions and Spend Billions on Lobbyists to Protect Their Interests Epidemic. Or the System Is Failing People Who Are Dying a Slow Extremely Miserable Death in Spite of the Fact That There Are Actual Science-Based Solutions Epidemic.Because there are in fact solutions. From evidence-based treatment to harm reduction there are solutions that might have saved not only my sister but the 70000 people the CDC estimates died from drug overdoses in 2017 alone. A year ago President Donald Trump's administration declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Last month he signed a law that he claimed would "end the scourge of drug addiction." But it won't. It won't even come close. While the bipartisan bill conveniently signed just two weeks before the midterm elections includes some meaningful measures experts agree it doesn't go nearly far enough since it omits essential life-saving solutions and fails to adequately fund its own proposals.For example my sister was arrested and incarcerated multiple times (always for nonviolent crimes directly related to her disease) and died in disturbing circumstances while she was in custody. A system that responds to a public health crisis with arrests courts and jails is a system that has failed. But at this point our prisons are full of people addicted to drugs: approximately half of inmates meet the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria for substance use or dependence disorder according to one study. Why not provide them with life-saving treatment while they're inside? Research shows that medication-assisted treatment a combination of therapy and medication such as buprenorphine or methadone is the most effective intervention for opioid addiction and that these medications reduce mortality by half or more. Yet Maddie like most prisoners never received treatment while incarcerated -- fewer than 1% of jails and prisons in the US administer FDA-approved addiction medications like methadone or buprenorphine. While Trump's opioid package takes steps to improve access to treatment for people who are incarcerated it does not appropriate any actual funding to do so.Even out of jail Madelyn found it difficult to get help. She was often forced to wait days or weeks to get into treatment inevitably at a short-term facility that required hours of travel for her to attend and our family to visit. Even if she was lucky enough to go to a facility that provided buprenorphine (nearly 59% of treatment facilities in the US offer no form of medication-assisted treatment) she found it difficult to access the medication she'd been prescribed in rehab once she re-entered the world. While certified physicians can prescribe opiate-based painkillers only those with a special waiver can prescribe buprenorphine. When she couldn't get buprenorphine she was either forced to go without life-saving treatment or make a long trek every day to a clinic that administered methadone. Imagine having to go to the doctor's office every single day to get your insulin or your blood pressure medication; imagine having to do so without a car or money to pay for a bus let alone an Uber. While the new legislation dubbed the Support for Patients and Communities Act ostensibly removes some barriers to buprenorphine prescribing it lacks the tens of billions of dollars that are realistically needed to boost access to this life-saving medication and does nothing to reform America's failed treatment system. The law President Trump signed also does virtually nothing to promote harm reduction which can keep people who use drugs alive long enough to enter recovery. The package failed to expand needle-exchange services or include safe injection spaces. My sister contracted hepatitis C as a result of using dirty needles and she never had access to a safe injection space which allows people who use drugs to inject in a medically supervised environment. While safe injection spaces are arguably illegal in the US cities like Philadelphia and Seattle are considering opening them. There are already more than 100 safe injection spaces around the world mostly in Europe Australia and Canada and studies show they can prevent death and infections like HIV or hepatitis and increase the number of people entering treatment.Until the moment my sister drew her last breath my family held onto the hope that she would not just survive her disease she would thrive. She had talked about going to college maybe becoming a nurse so she could help people like herself meeting someone who loved her and treated her well and raising her son. We grieve now not just for who she was but who we hoped she would become had she gotten the help she needed. My family now holds the hope we once had for Maddie for everyone still suffering from this disease and for their families. But that hope won't be realized without the meaningful action of politicians and policymakers. They are the people who can make sure no one who is addicted to opiates has to hope they can get clean that their families don't have to hope their loved ones will survive. To save the lives of people like my sister President Trump Congress and state lawmakers must respond to the escalating opioid epidemic with comprehensive well-funded legislation. It's time to move beyond hope to actually taking the steps needed to end the scourge of drug addiction.,Opinion

Or is there deep inside our species an equal propensity toward peace?I found a tentative answer to these questions that have vexed humanity through the ages when I was no more than a child growing up in Queens in the late 1940s. At about the time when it turns out that Donald Trump a mile or so away was taking his first steps in life I found myself at the age of 7 or so fiercely engaged in a street-level cult of war that he would might well approve of today given his militaristic posturing and bellicose language. But Trump's Queens was in that era of rampant discrimination almost entirely white whereas I resided -- thanks to my Argentine father's work for the fledgling United Nations --in an apartment complex called Parkway Village a multicultural multinational multiethnic enclave. And the most unlikely place in the world for any sort of conflict between children or adults for that matter to find fertile ground because it was thought of as a unique experiment in diversity -- international linguistic racial -- supposedly projecting a utopian vision of planetary harmony.Alas it was not harmony I sought as I roamed the gardens and open spaces of Parkway Village where confrontations had broken out between rival groups of the young sons of diplomats and staff who were so fervently dedicated to amity among nations and cultures. The clashes had started with an insult of some kind soon escalating to fists and stones and eventually sticks. The pugnacious kids were recent immigrants to the States perhaps eager to hold onto some form of nativist identity by bashing the heads of anyone who spoke strangely or looked different. The camp I belonged to consisted of French and Latin American lads with a Liberian and an Egyptian added to the mix while our opponents came primarily from Scandinavia and England vaguely replicating a divide between North and South that would be the source of so many toxic combats across the globe in the coming decades. Despite truces organized at afternoon teas by our horrified mothers the fighting became ever more ferocious.  Only Roy a sweet youngster from India -- a friend I have evoked before in a story I wrote some years ago --  attempted to stop the mayhem. He would often step between the two bands begging us not to hurt each other an intervention that was met by mockery from both sides (well something at least cruelly united us!). We turned his last name -- akin to Bahana -- into Banana. Roy was bananas crazy for believing he could convince us to abandon the masculine pleasures of our antagonism.And yet it was Roy who finally managed precisely that though not in the manner he or we could have foretold. One afternoon as I returned from school ready to rally the troops for another round of United-Nations-at-war my distressed father told me that Roy had died that morning of a heart attack during a dental operation. Dazed with grief and guilt I wandered into the wide area behind our house where the other boys soon began gathering. We all just stood there quietly our heads turned toward the ground our innocence shattered our games of death revealed as shameful and offensive. From that day onward the battles ceased.It was a way for the mourning child-warriors to honor the memory of the departed peacemaker keeping our small comrade alive -- or at least his message of brotherhood. Roy had wagered that war was a failure of the imagination stemming from the inability to feel the afflictions of adversaries as if they were our own. This fantastical possibility that an enemy could turn into a friend was made real for me a few months later when Jens the Danish ringleader of the rival gang moved into the house next door to ours.  We had soon become inseparable the best of pals.I remembered Roy recently as I watched the clips commemorating the ceremonies that marked the end of the First World War. His vision of a humanity that need not be condemned to endless cycles of aggression was anticipated by a young British officer called Wilfred Owen who died a mere week before the Armistice on November 11th 1918 one more senseless death among so many others senselessly wasted. Though only 24 years old when he was killed Owen wrote some extraordinary poems about his wartime experience.  In one of them "Strange Meeting" he eerily anticipated the impending end of his own life speaking of "the waste of war in its time." They are verses that today -- when humanity is assailed with similar stories of carnage poisonous gas attacks and fears of apocalypse -- are just as painfully relevant as they were back then. In that poem Owen channels the voice of a soldier who strikes up an unnerving conversation with a dead man. Together they mourn "the undone years the hopelessness" until the dead man reveals he was killed the previous day by the very soldier narrating this encounter: "I am the enemy you killed my friend... Let us sleep now." Owen was to sleep forever without seeing the conclusion of the "War to End All Wars" according to a phrase from H.G. Wells. As the interminable conflicts and victims of the next hundred years attest nothing could have been further from the truth: we continue to slaughter each other as if the curse of Cain is ingrained in our DNA as if we had learned nothing. Our leaders promise as Trump did in France to "protect the peace" while doing not nearly enough to really prevent war.We live in a world ravaged by incessant strife and the rise of the extreme nationalism that led to the First World War that so many now swear never to repeat. It is true that new incarnations of my friend Roy intervene across the globe. Doctors in Syria and Yemen mediators in Colombia and Afghanistan citizens contesting rage in Israel and Palestine peacekeepers in the Congo and Kosovo women -- and men --denouncing war rapes prove that there is no lack of brave members of our species ready to stand against the machines of war. What is lacking is the realization by us all that peace is a daily task that must be carried out not by heroic exceptional beings but by every concerned parent and every vulnerable child. Only when millions upon millions understand that struggle to be intimately theirs will no more Wilfred Owens die no more soldiers like him be sent to kill enemies whom they have never met and who could one day move in next door and become their best friends. Only then will Roy rest effectively in peace.,Opinion
 (CNN)Having children tends to increase our agony during moments of violence. I don't know a parent who after hearing about innocent people being hurt or killed doesn't instinctively reach for their kids and long to never let go. This feeling is especially strong when the violence was directed toward a group with whom your family identifies. What if it was us?My family consists of conservative Jews who regularly attend a conservative synagogue just like the Jews who were recently killed in Pittsburgh. Hate-filled trolls have repeatedly threatened violence against me and my Jewish children on social media. It's getting harder and harder to not think about the unthinkable.But after the initial agony passes and we release our children from our immobilizing grips their presence can actually help us work through these dark moments. Children have lots of questions and tend to be dogged pursuers of moral clarity. It's rarely enough for them to learn that something happened. They want to understand why it happened and will keep why-why-why-ing their way through each and every piece of information provided to them. At the end of this road sits the biggest question of them all the question not about the act of violence but about what would make someone do something like that in the first place. How does one help them make sense of hate?This is not an easy task. Intense hate is for most of us a foreign emotion one we have never felt.We must talk to our children about it anyway explaining to them why someone hates them where this hate comes from and how it has been dealt with in the past. While this conversation should absolutely include an acknowledgment of all the other groups who are the target of it the processing of hate best happens through particulars -- of a people of a history of a moment. In my family this means viewing hate through a Jewish lens.Begin with the past The Jewish holiday cycle rests largely upon a series of ancient stories in which Jews were persecuted for being Jewish and then ultimately prevail. During Passover we remember when we were slaves in Egypt. During Purim we remember when our lives were threatened in ancient Persia. And so on."They tried to kill us we survived let's eat" goes the old joke a pithy summary of many Jewish holidays. When children receive a Jewish education it's these stories the Jewish communal memory that take prominence. Is it strange to hear preschool children discuss the various ways in which one group of people can express their hatred of another? "Sometimes the Jews want to stay but aren't allowed to and sometimes the Jews want to leave and aren't allowed to" my son reflected at age 5. Yes it's strange. But there's no Judaism without it.So how does one take our history in which hatred of the Jews is a leitmotif and use it to help our children make sense of the present? Shai Held rabbi Jewish theologia and author of "The Heart of the Torah" said stories of past persecution can help us understand how hate is sadly an inescapable part of the human experience. "Any religious perspective on the world is going to emphasize that human nature is messy and complex and human beings are prone to hate" he said. "There is oddly something helpful in knowing there is nothing new here. ... It allows you some degree of sobriety."An incident of hate becomes a chance to discuss not just hate but the ways all of us contain within us the capacity for bad and good. No we aren't ever likely to find a way to stop that bad from occasionally growing into violent hate in some people. But if we pay attention we will notice that expressions of hate are often met by expressions of love and compassion.In nearly every ancient story of hate there are non-Jewish people who fight on Jews' behalf. Last month Jews saw non-Jews of all backgrounds join us in mourning and protest."I think it is always powerful to remind kids that if someone hates you it doesn't mean everyone hates you" Held said.A reckoning with hate when rooted in Jewish history is also a reckoning with resilience. Yes lots and lots of people have hated us incensed by the mere fact that we are not exactly like them. But they didn't win. Held said parents could emphasize this against-the-odds survival of the Jews as a point of relief if not pride for children. "Thousands of years of antisemitism has instilled in us a deep persistence" he said. Connect it to childhood feelingsWe all old and young have an instinct to trace hate back to its source. Where does it come from? And how does it take shape?Children (and their parents) might get some insight into how hate develops by studying the behavior of their younger siblings cousins or friends. Wariness of all people and things unfamiliar begins to unfold in the early years of life explained Fred Zelinger a New York-based psychologist who previously worked in schools."We are wired to be uncomfortable with things that are different" he said. "Most kids outgrow it past age 3 but some environments can make it flourish."If a child is never exposed to other cultures or is told that these other cultures are bad then that perfectly natural "stranger danger" can morph into something more menacing and permanent. This is particularly the case with people who have fragile self-esteems and seek to improve their standing by putting down or eliminating those who they see as a threat. A good way to show children how all this works is by deliberately modeling the complete opposite explained Laurie Zelinger child psychologist and author of "Please Explain Terrorism to Me: A Story for Children." Speak kindly about other groups of people; eat in their restaurants; play alongside them at playgrounds; learn about and when possible celebrate their holidays; invite them over your house. This is especially important during moments of communal fear when calls for diversity in speech are not often met by diversity in action."When people feel scared they have an instinct to insulate their children and keep them away from anything they are nervous about" she said. Focus on the oppositeThere's an underlying element of hate that will likely remain inscrutable to children -- and everyone else. When we hit the edge of our ability to process it the best and really only place to turn to is toward the goodness the majority of us contain within.Out of all that was written in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting the one phrase that provided me with the most comfort was a declaration of the human capacity for good. "May we redouble our efforts towards kindness and love" my rabbi wrote in an email sent hours after the killings took place."One of the things that is striking about Jewish theology is that Jews are supposed to learn compassion and empathy from two places. We learn it from God's compassion which is the positive model. And we learn it from our suffering in Egypt which is the negative model. Whether you have a positive or negative experience you are supposed to learn empathy" Held explained.Love is not sadly the only answer to hate. Vigilance education self-defense and self-care are all necessary too. But it's our unyielding belief in human goodness that makes it all worth it. I believe most children already feel this but it is up to us to help them understand it.Elissa Strauss writes about the politics and culture of parenthood.,Opinion
Suzanne Roberts is a poet travel writer and memoirist. The views expressed here are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)One of the reasons my parents moved us to Thousand Oaks when I was in the fourth grade was because it was such a safe place to live and that has continued to be true. Mayor Andy Fox has called Thousand Oaks the safest city in America in interviews since the shooting. If there were a picture in the dictionary of "American suburban life" it would be of Thousand Oaks with its rolling hills and oak trees its luxury car dealerships and shopping malls. I found all that safety stifling when I was growing up so after college I didn't return like some of my childhood friends did. I said "I'll never live in the suburbs again" and that has proven mostly true -- until my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer in October 2016.I tried to persuade her to move up to Lake Tahoe with me but she wasn't having it. She had lived in Thousand Oaks for nearly 40 years and she wanted to die there. In the months I lived there with her I walked with my dog through the manicured neighborhoods passing the gated communities in Sunset Hills returning to her community where all the stucco houses look exactly the same. In the fall a murder of crows caw from the sycamores and in the spring bunnies hop across the greenbelts.I drove the familiar roads past my elementary middle and high schools on my way to pick up my mother's medications and shop for her groceries. I strolled through The Oaks Mall lit with holiday lights and decorations looking for gifts. When my mother felt well enough we would go to the library and local park together watching the ducks and the turtles looking for the beauty in the world. And we found it.Last year when the bank called to tell me the sale of my childhood home was complete the escrow officer said "Congratulations!" I started to cry. And like all people who surprise others with their unexpected tears I apologized saying "It's just really hard."And although I shouldn't have done it a few months ago when I was back in town for my high school reunion I drove by our house the house I didn't know I loved until it was gone. It felt like the end of an era but my childhood and teenage years -- roller-skating and track meets hiking in Wildwood and ice blocking on the Sunset Hills golf course -- they are still there in the Thousand Oaks that lives in the dwelling place of my memory.This is all to say that the safety of Thousand Oaks may have felt stifling to me when I was a young person looking for adventure beyond my parents' house; now after the killings of 12 people have made the community's name a household word I see that I relied on it -- even if I wasn't going to live there something about knowing it was there was important to me. My first kiss was in the parking lot of The Oaks Mall. The friendships I made at Thousand Oaks High School have lasted into my adulthood. Both of my parents died there.The mayor of Thousand Oaks said Friday that if this can happen there -- meaning the Borderline Bar mass shooting where those 12 people died -- then it can happen anywhere. I always already knew that or at least I thought I did when it happened in other places places that were close to home but not home exactly.If my mother were still alive she would be watching the news on its horrible loop getting up only during commercials. She'd be checking in with her friends from the local hardware store where she worked because some of her young colleagues frequented Borderline. I would tell her to turn off the news and she would shush me saying as she often did when she heard about people who died suddenly: "And they didn't even have a death sentence." What she meant was that she had been given three months to live after being diagnosed with cancer and she herself had accepted this death sentence. During every month she lived after that and she was still there sitting on the couch alive she would ask when she heard of sudden death "It's incredible isn't it? No one even told them that they were going to die."But here in America we're all living with a death sentence one we also have come to accept. Death awaits us at movies and nightclubs at our elementary schools and colleges in our synagogues our mosques and our churches. The very thing that some of us argue keeps us free and safe -- our right to own guns -- has become our terminal diagnosis and we can't escape it not even in the safest city in America.,Opinion

(CNN)In an interview with "Good Morning America"'s Robin Roberts for her new memoir "Becoming" Michelle Obama revealed that her two daughters Malia and Sasha were conceived using in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Malia Obama's eldest daughter was born in 1998 20 years after the birth of the first IVF baby Louise Brown in a hospital in Oldham England. In 1998 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slightly over 80000 assisted reproductive technology procedures (ARTs) were performed in the United States. Two decades later that figure has more than tripled. Nearly 2% of live births in the US are the result of IVF and other ARTs (including intrauterine transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection or ICSI in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg to effect fertilization). Over eight million children have been born via IVF worldwide. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 9% of women aged 35 to 44 reported that they or their partner had undergone fertility treatment.Obama's disclosure that their children were the product of IVF is a welcome addition to this public conversation about infertility one which will hopefully prompt some women and men to reconsider whether it could be a solution for them. It is inevitable that Obama's star power will help demystify this medical process. But what greater public familiarity with IVF won't do is help the many women and couples struggling with infertility for whom the principal obstacle to parenthood is financial not psychological. For too many the price of IVF places the procedure out of reach. The spiraling costs associated with the "infertility industry" mean that the benefits of new assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are not equally available to all. Professional women like Michelle Obama remain most likely to pursue IVF not just because they have put their careers before childbirth and left it too late to have babies the natural way as the common cultural myth goes but because they can afford to. (According to the CDC's most recent report less than one-third of ART treatments result from a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve which tends to correlate with advanced maternal age lower than the number of treatments performed as a result of male-factor infertility.)IVF's high price tag combined with an uneven insurance coverage has created an entrenched social division between IVF haves and have nots. When the Pew Research Center's figure of 9% of women or couples who have undergone infertility treatment is broken down by race the discrepancies are stark. While 12% of white women report that they or their partners have undergone treatment only 3% of black women and 5% of Hispanic women report the same.  This is despite the fact that as Ann V. Bell recently wrote in "Misconception" women of color are in fact more likely to suffer from infertility. The education gap is equally stark. While 56% of adults with a postgraduate degree say that they have either undergone infertility treatment or know someone who has only 20% of those with a high school degree or less report experience or knowledge of infertility treatment. There is to a certain extent a chicken and egg aspect to the lower instance of IVF amongst women of color. Because they encounter fewer friends and family who have undergone IVF they are less likely to consider it as an option. Obama's speaking out about her own infertility will hopefully show African-American and other minority women that IVF is not exclusively a white woman's solution. But while Obama's revelation may inspire a greater interest in the procedure it does nothing to lower the financial barriers to infertility treatment.In her recent "Conceivability: What I Learned Exploring the Frontiers of Fertility" Elizabeth Katkin describes spending nearly $200000 in pursuit of a baby. Katkin's experience is exceptional and involved eight IVF cycles in America England and Russia. More typical is the case of Nurse Frankie the featured patient on the episode of ABC's long-running medical drama "Grey's Anatomy" which aired the night before Michelle Obama's "Good Morning America" interview. Frankie described on the show as "skating towards 40" paid "$41632 for three rounds of IVF and a miscarriage." An IVF cycle costs on average $17000 for drugs and treatment with additional costs of several thousands of dollars if a patient uses ICSI to increase the chances of success in cases of male-factor infertility; freezes her embryos; or opts to submit her embryos to preimplantation genetic screening (PGS).  A bill of $41632 for three rounds of treatment would be about par for the course for someone whose health insurance partially covered the IVF medication protocol but not the treatment itself.Sixty-three percent of American women pay for IVF treatment entirely out-of-pocket. Patients who meet strict age and health criteria can potentially hedge against the costs of multiple rounds of IVF by opting for one of the myriad "baby or your money back" programs first pioneered by Maryland-based Shady Grove Fertility in 1993 which cap the costs for multiple rounds of IVF between $20000 and $40000 dollars (often excluding the cost of necessary drugs) with the promise of a refund if the treatments are not ultimately successful.  The schemes are essentially shared risk pools for women pursuing infertility treatment without insurance as those who become pregnant on the first round do not receive a partial refund and effectively cross-subsidize patients requiring multiple rounds of treatment.  A handful of states including most recently Delaware require health insurance companies to provide at least limited IVF coverage. Texas requires health insurers to offer policies that cover IVF but do not compel employers to select those policies for their employees. Even in states where some form of IVF coverage is mandatory out-of-pocket costs can run into the thousands of dollars. According to Fertility IQ a private organization founded by former infertility patients which collates information on US patients' experience of infertility treatment the technology consulting and accounting and banking and finance sectors rank highest in terms of fertility benefits offered while the industrial and retail sectors rank lowest.IVF came of age in the wake of the second-wave feminist movement and campaigns for abortion rights which both argued that biology was not destiny and that a woman's reproductive choices were her own to make without interference from the state. Together these two convictions have up to now also largely stymied any united campaign by women to ensure that IVF was covered by health insurance or in countries with national health systems financed by the state. The result is that IVF has grown up largely within the private marketplace with prices determined by what the market will bear. While an ever-growing number of professional women are finding the resources to conquer infertility through IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies the treatment's high price tag means that many are effectively priced out of motherhood.   The recent shift in the abortion wars towards a focus on accessibility and affordability as embodied in the landmark 2016 Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt case or Congressional efforts to limit access to abortion services by defunding Planned Parenthood underscore the reality that a woman's reproductive choices are not her own to make if practical and financial realities limit her ability to pursue some choices. Michelle Obama has done a great service to infertile women and couples in sharing her own IVF journey. Her status as a role model for many women across the racial and social spectrum makes her ideally positioned to take the conversation further and push women doctors and legislators to re-evaluate whether the comparatively unregulated expansion of the IVF industry in America has actually increased the average woman's ability to control her own fertility.This article was updated to reflect more exact price information provided directly by Shady Grove Fertility.,Opinion

(CNN)"Is my skirt too short?""Is my phone charged?""Is there someone to walk with me at night?"Every day women around the world cycle through a mental checklist of questions in an attempt to protect themselves from harassment assault rape or worse. Yet even after the one-year anniversary of the #MeToo movement it's worth pausing to reflect on an underappreciated reality: Why should women be the only ones to bear this burden?In his book "The Gift of Fear" Gavin de Becker wrote: "Most men fear getting laughed at or humiliated by a romantic prospect while most women fear rape and death." Awkwardness versus assault -- now that's a dreadful disparity. According to a 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report women are right to fear sexual misconduct. About 1 in 3 women will experience some form of sexual violence over the course of their lifetimes. For men the risk is less than 1 in 6. And to make matters all the more terrifying the CDC report also states that 26% to 58% of victims will experience their first rape before turning 18.I have been raised with a "tool kit" on how to survive in this sexually aggressive world. In my middle school only the girls were required to take self-defense. And my mom made sure my sister and I as well as some close friends had pepper spray at the tender age of 12. Her mother had worried that her daughter might be hit by a car; now she was worried her daughter might be a victim of an unwanted advance. I suppose the tool kit was a smart investment since I first got catcalled when I was 13. If the acne and awkwardness of middle school wasn't enough now I had to add being leered at to my list of things about which to worry. Since then outfits I couldn't wait to debut have been hanging all alone in the back of my closet. My brand-new light pink floral spaghetti-strap summer dress has been orphaned. But teenagers shouldn't have to grow up this fast. And we shouldn't have to make these sacrifices.Whenever a woman is the victim of sexual violence the aftermath is far too predictable. Questions from "What was she wearing?" to "Did she lead him on?" often color the conversation -- our collective focus falling to what the woman not the assailant could have done differently in the situation. And now the business community has bought into this idea -- creating products to arm girls and women better. Two entrepreneurs fundraised to launch a line of "rape proof" underwear which they marketed as "underwear only you can take off!" Similarly a handful of students from North Carolina State University  have developed a nail polish to detect date rape drugs. While I can see the values in these products they fail to address the underlying systemic problem of rape culture -- one driven not by the victims but the men (and sometimes women) who perpetrate these crimes.Thankfully this viewpoint is beginning to gain traction. Activists such as Jackson Katz who recently visited my high school are advancing the notion that so-called women's issues are in fact men's issues.Specifically Katz advocates what's called the "bystander approach": In the face of harassment men can no longer stand by. Instead they need to stand up. Ultimately our goal should be to end the current female checklist. Instead imagine a checklist such as this:"Go for a jog with both earbuds in.""Go to a party without clutching my Diet Coke as a shield.""Take my beautiful dress out from its premature retirement."To do that requires not just female self-empowerment but also male education. Together we can end the culture of abuse that's robbing our teenage girls of their adolescence. ,Opinion
Koritha Mitchell is a literary historian cultural critic and author of the award-winning book "Living with Lynching." As associate professor of English at Ohio State University she specializes in African American literature and racial violence in US history and contemporary culture. Follow her @ProfKori. The views expressed here are solely the author's. View more opinion articles on CNN.  (CNN)Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith who faces former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in a run-off election on November 27 is facing public outcry after jokingly invoking "hanging" while campaigning in a state where lynching was once a common occurrence. "If he invited me to a public hanging I'd be on the front row" Hyde-Smith is heard saying in a video posted to Twitter Sunday morning. She was referring to a cattle rancher who supported her.  Hyde-Smith later issued a statement saying that she "used an exaggerated expression of regard [for a supporter] and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous."  But her remark underscored a simple truth that many Americans prefer to ignore: Lynching and politics are inextricably linked.  Lynching literally shaped the political landscape Americans have inherited; our politics today are in part defined by the belief that white people should have the right to hold themselves and each other to incredibly low standards -- that they shouldn't have to be decent toward people who aren't white. When white people have not actively worked to create a society fueled by fair play and equal opportunity they have often ignored the political repression that mobs bent on extra-judicial "justice" achieved -- and the benefits like power and economic success they themselves have reaped as a result. Only a person whose ancestors or family members bore no risk of being lynched themselves would dismiss as "ridiculous" objections to making hanging into a public political joke in Mississippi. Hyde-Smith's remarks and her defensiveness are indicative of the flawed but common arguments made by some white Americans that they bear no responsibility for structural racism and -- as argued even recently by the President -- that pointing out instances of racism is itself "racist." We need the majority of white people to stop being content with the fact that there's no literal blood on their hands. We need them to hold themselves to a higher standard.Many Americans underestimate lynching's political role because they focus on "strange fruit" the image of black bodies dangling from trees during the Jim Crow era and think of those who left those bodies as bygone extremists. However there was a social and political purpose for producing visual evidence of black people's vulnerability: to make them accept their "proper" subordinate place in society. "Strange fruit" was also evidence of white people's freedom -- to exercise power to be citizens to kill. Even those who did not take their freedom to that extreme were assured of it. If all they did was insult a black person or exclude them from opportunity they could by comparison see themselves as liberal and tolerant.           It is estimated that more than 4400 African American men women and children were lynched between 1877 and 1950 and these murders were designed to maintain the political hierarchy according to race.  As investigative journalist Ida B. Wells found in the 1890s "The mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American." I always say black success beckons the mob because white supremacist violence most often emerged to counter African American achievement. Mobs targeted black people who owned land that whites wanted to take; who were self-assured enough to defend themselves against assault or harassment including sexual assault and harassment; or who sought political participation including voting.The nation's African American lynch victims were often hanged burned or shot but this brutality did not require hatred so much as it relied on the masses of white people holding themselves to low standards. As long as they weren't doing the bloody work themselves these atrocities simply confirmed that they were "good" people who had little in common with those who would join mobs. As long as the blood wasn't on their hands (or they weren't in the "front row") they were not part of the problem -- and could pretend that their safe access to education and voting for example had nothing to do with violence.Many Americans also underestimate the political role of lynching because it was attached to the idea that black men are rapists obsessed with white women but this is where Hyde-Smith's comments offer clarity again. When criticized for joking about a "public hanging" she insisted that the only relevant context for understanding the quip was her "high regard" for the person whose invitation she accepted. She's right. She was simply announcing her political allegiances. Hyde-Smith reiterated at a press conference Monday that she stands by her statement and Gov. Phil Bryant defended her saying "I know this woman and I know her heart." But her heart isn't the point; lynching's role in shaping Mississippi politics is. The black rapist myth was so powerful there that the idea that 14-year-old Emmett Till might have whistled at a white woman got him killed. Its resonance can still be felt in the fact that Donald Trump could launch his presidential campaign by calling some Mexican immigrants "rapists." Its relevance can also be seen in the ease with which a white woman in Brooklyn (who has since apologized) sexualized a 9-year-old who accidentally bumped her behind with his backpack.  For Hyde-Smith to gesture toward lynching was therefore especially freighted because white women often lent their femininity and purported need for protection to the cause of justifying other people's political disfranchisement. Without question the threat of lynching was a major tool for what we now call voter suppression so insisting that mobs formed because black men were rapists who targeted white women made white women important political pawns. Then and now some white women like the proxy power that comes with being aligned with the powerful. Mike Espy Hyde-Smith's African American opponent lamented on CNN's "New Day" that her comments are "harmful because they tend to reinforce the stereotypes that have held back our state for so long and that have cost us jobs and harmed our economy."  As a candidate for statewide office he is right to be concerned that his state will remain economically depressed but unfortunately many will tolerate such consequences. When white people hold themselves and each other to low standards elites benefit and some white people suffer. But because people of color bear the brunt and because even white Americans who are harmed identify more with  powerful whites than with black and brown citizens many see no reason to work for change.Because racial violence has so profoundly shaped the entire American political landscape all of us have to consider what Mississippi's past and present reveals about the country more broadly. We must confront this as an issue of decent behavior. White people must begin to redefine what makes them "good" and "decent." They must ask "What actions have I taken that align with my claim that this is a country of equal opportunity?" Only then can we begin to re-shape American politics.,Opinion

(CNN)There will be people who learn about the passing of Stan Lee and politely pause before shrugging off his contributions as child's play. And while it is true he became famous for the creation of Marvel Comics and characters such as Spider-Man Black Panther Thor and The Incredible Hulk the reason why he is loved isn't child's play at all. His famous characters may have started off as comics but they never stayed on the page. They outgrew the merchandising. They overflowed out of our televisions. They even are larger than their fictional lives portrayed on the big screen. That's because Stan Lee did more than create characters. He created hope and hope cannot be contained. Those who would hear of Stan Lee's passing and not feel a tremendous sense of loss do so I would argue because they are not able to see all that he gave the world. And that's OK. If everybody could lift Thor's hammer it wouldn't be that special. Even Stan Lee said he was initially embarrassed to tell people what he did because other people were building bridges or going on to medical school. But he eventually understood that what he did was more than kid stuff.His series "X-Men" and "Black Panther" are essentially manuals on discrimination and how to combat it. "Iron Man" explores the uneasy marriage of capitalism and weapons making. "Captain America" wrestles with patriotism: what to do when your country is on the wrong side? Ultimately it doesn't matter if you know Stan Lee because we all know him by his principles.  And principles aren't weakened if the author of those principles goes unnoticed. They are only weakened if they are not applied. So as long as we remember this: "With great power comes great responsibility" Stan Lee lives. That's not to say that concept did not exist before Spider-Man's uncle said it to him. In fact Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein are quoted saying something very similar many years before. Just as patriotism didn't start with Captain America fighting discrimination didn't begin with the X-Men and portraying women as leaders wasn't something Janet van Dyne -- also known as The Wasp -- introduced. But these principles of integrity equality fairness were not a consistent element in American culture during the 1960s 1970s or even 1980s. In fact one could argue that  the heroes who populated Stan Lee's universe were in direct opposition to the world in which he and his readers existed. But by planting and nurturing those seeds with imaginative worlds and inspiring adventures who's to say that Lee did not help a generation of real-life heroes to emerge? No we don't have super strength and we can't fly but we fight society's ills armed with the principles woven into the words of some of our favorites characters. This is how Stan Lee lives on. Not with T-shirts or blockbuster movies but by our willingness to use whatever power we have for good and not evil. To help those in need. To remember doing the right thing doesn't require us to be perfect because many of the heroes of Marvel Universe are far from it. But that's not why they were heroes in the first place. They were heroes because they were willing to try to help for good. Whenever we are willing to try to be our higher selves those characters will have life -- and so Stan Lee will live on. Some folks would smirk and think that's just a bunch of fanboy malarkey and that's OK. As I said earlier everyone can't lift Thor's hammer. ,Opinion

His mother said she had just thrown him a graduation party.  You could see the pride in her eyes as tears flowed down her face.  It took every ounce of strength I had to remain composed and provide her with the support she needed.  I didn't have the courage to tell her that her son and I had more in common than she realized. When I was his age I was nearly killed after being shot in the throat with a .38 caliber bullet.  I survived.  But this woman's son died. To this day I continue to ask myself why I was given this second chance. Many of my patients are not given the same second chance I have had.  And the worst part of my job is having to speak with mothers fathers sisters and brothers -- and telling them their loved one has died.  The memory I have of their faces the piercing cries I hear at night and the blood that has stained my scrubs and the operating room floor are reasons enough for the medical community to be a critical part of the solution. While mass shootings like the one in Thousand Oaks California last week occupy much of the media's attention it is important to note that these large-scale tragedies comprise less than 2% of the gun violence we see in this country.  Meanwhile every day in cities like Baltimore and Chicago young black men fall victim to gun violence at a disproportionate rate. Their stories often go untold.  The medical community -- including nurses medics technicians pharmacists social workers and doctors -- stand on the front lines of caring for victims of gun violence.  We see the physical damage inflicted by gunshot wounds and we also witness the pain of those victims they leave behind.  So you might imagine our surprise on November 7 when the National Rifle Association told us to stay in our lane and not get involved in issues of gun violence that go beyond treating the bodily damage that results.  That type of message indicates the NRA is not serious about addressing this public health crisis that we face. If it were it would realize that a complex issue such as gun violence requires engagement of stakeholders from all walks of life and with diverse perspectives on the issue.  Furthermore to state as the NRA did that "the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves" ignores the efforts that have been made by medical professionals to engage with those outside our own field. In January 2017 Ronny Stewart trauma medical director of the American College of Surgeons told me the ACS sat down with the leadership of the NRA to discuss opportunities to work together to combat gun violence.  It is also worth noting that the health care community contains gun owners and NRA members many of whom have expressed to me their astonishment at the idea that we the medical community should not provide solutions to reduce firearm injury and death in this country. Our role in aiding gunshot victims is seen in every hospital across America -- and is now as a result of the outpouring against the NRA's tweet being more fully recognized by the global community all across social media. Shortly after the NRA tweeted its comments the Twitter account @ThisIsOurLane exploded.  While the stories are heart-wrenching and difficult to read and the images shared from inside trauma centers were beyond words they are mission critical to demonstrating to the public why our role in gun violence is front and center.Despite the fact that the NRA has attempted to undermine and dismiss the medical community we are willing to rise above the fray to express how serious we are about ending gun violence in this country.  A recent open letter composed by the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine or AFFIRM on behalf of the American Health Care Professionals is inviting the NRA to be part of the solution. Megan Ranney M.D. MPH chief research officer of AFFIRM and one of the signers of the letter recently told me: "As the professionals who manage this epidemic we bear witness to every trauma and attempt to resuscitate successful or not."Let me be clear: We are also not anti-gun -- we are anti-bullet hole.  It is time to stop polarizing this issue and start developing action-oriented solutions that will end gun violence in America.,Opinion

(CNN)Something unusual and possibly even instructive happened on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.Following a small firestorm last weekend -- when SNL's Pete Davidson mocked Republican Dan Crenshaw a former Navy SEAL wounded in Afghanistan -- the two came together in a sincere plea for unity.Seeing these two join in a message of reconciliation was moving. But the question has to be asked: Can we in the time of Donald Trump find common ground between those who oppose him and those who support him? It's an issue that I and many others wrestle with. "SNL" offered us some guidance on how we might be able to achieve just that.The controversy that led to Saturday's "moment of Zen" began last week when Davidson during the Weekend Update segment told jokes about several Republican candidates running for office."SNL" mocking people in politics is what the show does best. But in this instance Davidson whose father was a firefighter killed on 9/11 showed a picture of Crenshaw who wears an eye patch because of his war injuries. Davidson joked "You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate for Texas and not a hit-man in a porno movie." Then he added a line that made it worse saying "I'm sorry. I know he lost his eye in war -- or whatever." Well the backlash was swift with many on social media going after Davidson -- and the National Republican Congressional Candidate even demanding an apology.Crenshaw though pushed back against the idea that an apology was necessary stating "I want us to get away from this culture where we demand an apology every time someone misspeaks." He did note that veterans across the nation "probably don't feel as though their wounds they received in battle should be the subject of a bad punchline."That sentiment was a welcome breath of fresh air in a time when the slightest insult is met with instant outrage. But Davidson still felt compelled to apologize opening his appearance on Weekend Update this week with these words: "I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It was a poor choice of words. The man is a war hero and he deserves all the respect in the world." The comedian added "And if any good came of this maybe it was that for one day the left and the right finally came together to agree on something. That I'm a d---." At that point Crenshaw who won his congressional race in Texas on Tuesday made a surprise appearance where he accepted Davidson's apology and then delivered some good-natured jokes at Davidson's expense. One of the best was when Crenshaw joked about Davidson "He looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person."After a few more jokes Crenshaw then delivered his own heartfelt plea "There's a lot of lessons to learn here. Not just that the left and right can still agree on some things. But also this: Americans can forgive one another." Crenshaw went on to remind people of the sacrifice of our veterans and those "we lost on 9/11 heroes like Pete's father."  It was a beautiful moment unlike anything I can recall on "SNL" -- and I worked on the show's production staff for eight seasons. But the line that stayed with me the most was when he said "We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other."Can we truly see the good in each other despite disagreeing so passionately on political issues? If we ever have a chance of becoming the United States of America -- as opposed to people who happen to live on the same land mass -- we need to do just that.  And no I'm not asking for a kumbaya moment where we all join hands and sing Elvis Costello's "Peace Love and Understanding." Although I have to say I wish we could. It's a great song.However we could learn a thing or two from Crenshaw and Davidson. Rather than trying to one up each other or score political points with their respective audiences they made a sincere attempt to connect in a respectful and playful manner. Our nation is desperate for more of this and I bet many people across the political spectrum would agree. The only thing stopping us from doing more of that is ourselves. ,Opinion

(CNN)I can't wait until you have kids of your own. That's what I tell my son whenever he forgets to check in. Wait until you have kids then you will understand what happens to parents' hearts whenever children don't let them know they're going to miss curfew when 24 hours goes by and still no return text message when you turn on the television and learn a horrific tragedy involving young people has unfolded. Like what happened at the Pulse nightclub in 2016. Like what happened at the Ariana Grande concert in 2017.  Like what happened Wednesday night at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks California.Details are still emerging about the country's latest mass shooting but what we know is this: Twelve people were shot and killed on "college night" at the bar.  All life is precious but as a parent my heart breaks each time I see images of other parents gathered together at the scene of senseless violence praying for a text that says "I'm OK." Over the years I have chastised my son numerous times for not checking in. Even now as he prepares to graduate from college I still insist he hits me up just so I know he's fine. And when he has children of his own he will finally understand I wasn't insistent that he checks in because I didn't trust him. I did it because I don't trust the world. How could anyone when so often this type of violence happens and we're left wondering how? How could anyone go into a video game convention and shoot up the place like what occurred in Jacksonville? How could anyone walk into a synagogue and do the same in Pittsburgh? A crowded bar in Thousand Oaks a place that especially struck a nerve because it's not far from me and my friends here in Los Angeles. It's hard to trust the world with your precious love when time and time again the world just doesn't make sense. Maybe we'll find out why a 28-year-old veteran did this. But even if we did would that feel any better? If it's a mental health issue do you think we'll address it? If it were about how he got or kept his gun is there an obtainable solution readily available? I don't want to be a pessimist but do you honestly think our leaders will have the stamina to talk about the Thousand Oaks shooting when the cameras are gone? When you are a parent and you see the pain and sense of helplessness of others during these tragedies it registers. When you see the ineptitude of leaders in the wake such tragedies that registers as well.  "I'm a Thousand Oaks resident" 19-year old Erika Sigman said after the attack to the Los Angeles Times. "This is a safe place. My parents let me go here. This is a trusted place. ... To know that this happened in my safe place is a very very scary thing."  There are no safe places. Schools churches malls ... all places where parents used to be able to send their kids and not worry are now the sites of some of the country's deadliest mass shootings. Sometimes it's the inner city. Sometimes it's the suburbs. Weekends and weekdays. Day as well as night. There are no safe places no safe days no safe times. To be a parent today is to recognize that no matter how hard we try we can't shelter them forever. All we can do is instill good values and ask that they let us know they're OK from time to time if for no other reason than for our own peace of mind. They may not understand the importance of doing so now but when they have kids of their own they will. ,Opinion

(CNN)In a recent scientific paper two Harvard researchers make a very daring speculation.  They suggest it's possible that an alien artifact built by extraterrestrial intelligence has flown through our solar system.  This speculation while of potentially enormous import is almost certainly wrong.  However the idea is sufficiently interesting that it is worth understanding what is being proposed.In 2017 newspapers reported the observation of a visitor to the solar system called Oumuamua an unusual object that was hot dog-like in shape and estimated to be about a half-mile long and 80 meters wide.  It dove in from interstellar space before buzzing by the sun and then rocketing outward past Mars. When Oumuamua was initially observed it was thought to be an asteroid. However once the object's velocity and trajectory were determined that possibility was ruled out. Instead it appeared to be more like a comet in which case it would make a single pass through the solar system and leave never to return. Oumuamua approached the sun from above the plane of the solar system dove below the sun's southern pole and then used the sun's gravitational field to slingshot itself back above the plane of the solar system as it headed off into deep space.  While its trajectory seemed comet-like there was no evidence of the typical tail one sees in comets.So regardless of the improbable assertion of extra-terrestrial involvement this is an interesting thing.  An object without a tail moving with sufficient velocity that it must have come from interstellar space entered and will leave the solar system.  In science it is generally true that where there is one example of something there are many.  And so researchers were very excited at the prospect that Oumuamua could lead to a new branch of astronomy.Scientists monitored the body noting how its brightness and its velocity changed.  The varying brightness can give some information on the object's shape and the manner in which it is rotating while the velocity is expected to follow the law of gravity which is very strict.  It's that last measurement that has caused this recent hubbub.Give an astronomer an object's position velocity and trajectory and he or she can predict far into the future where it will be and how fast it will be going.  There's only one problem: The predictions for Oumuamua's velocity and ongoing measurements disagree.  It appears to be leaving the solar system more quickly than expected based on gravity.  This is another way of saying that is that it is experiencing a small and unexplained acceleration away from the Sun.  Now this acceleration is very small indeed; the effect of gravity is about 200000 times bigger.  In addition it's being reported that this unexplained effect is changing in a very specific way.  As the distance between Oumuamua and the sun increases the unanticipated acceleration decreases as the square of that distance.  There is a very pedestrian explanation for this non-gravitational behavior: The object is "outgassing" which means various forms of ice are melting and puffing off into space.  Basically it's the same principle as a rocket ship.  Near the sun there would be lots of melting and lots of puffing.  Further from the sun the melting would slow and that would result in less unexplained acceleration.  This is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the object's movement through space -- except of course that there has been no observation of a comet-like tail which is caused by exactly this sort of melting of ice.  That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist but it hasn't been seen and that means that astronomers cannot assume it is there.This brings us to the most recent conjecture made by two physicists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysical Research.  There is another possible source of the acceleration called "radiation pressure" which is a force that comes from light from the sun bouncing off Oumuamua.  That force is clearly related to the amount of light bouncing off the object and thus it should depend on the distance Oumuamua is from the sun.The Harvard researchers embraced the radiation pressure hypothesis and then calculated the mass and other properties that Oumuamua must have consistent with all known measurements.  They concluded that the object might be a solar sail of extraterrestrial origins which is a possible technology that is being considered for humans to send probes to other stars. It's not a completely far-fetched idea. The researchers went on to imagine a number of scenarios including that Oumuamua was space debris from an extraterrestrial civilization or even more provocative that it was a fully operational probe that entered the solar system did a survey and is moving on.  If that were true then astronomers named Oumuamua very aptly as the word means "scout" in Hawaiian. Is this explanation likely?  No of course not.  Is this hypothesis the result of hopeless crackpottery?  No that's not true either.  Both the authors of the paper establishing the unexplained acceleration and the authors exploring the light sail idea are respected scientists with unblemished research histories and no hint of scientific misconduct or otherwise suspicious behavior.So what could it be?  Well I suppose the extraterrestrial origin is possible but very unlikely.  To better appreciate the scientific method one should return to the original paper that reported the object's unexplained acceleration.  It makes very strong claims that something in addition to gravity is going on so we can be pretty certain about that.  Further the paper proposes some plausible explanations for how outgassing might be the explanation even though no outgassing was observed.  And on a more cautionary note if you dig a bit deeper it says that while the way in which the acceleration changes relative to the object's distance from the sun is consistent with either the outgassing or radiation pressure hypothesis they cannot rule out other behaviors.  That would mean that astronomers need to rethink the entire situation."Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence" is an aphorism made popular by Carl Sagan the legendary planetary scientist and science popularizer. The motion of Oumuamua is a perfect example of how it applies.  It is almost certain that this mystery has an ordinary explanation but it is at least physically possible that the probe explanation is true.But until I see extraordinary evidence I'd bet against it.,Opinion
Joe Parilla is a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at The Brookings Institution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jeff Bezos was so obsessed with Amazon's growth in the mid-1990s that he had the firm's motto "Get Big Fast" imprinted on t-shirts for all his employees. Two decades later Amazon is outgrowing its current home of Seattle so rapidly that it has spent the past year running a competition to select a new US city in which to build its 50000-person "HQ2." The search finally ended Tuesday with Amazon splitting the headquarters between two East Coast megaregions — the Northern Virginia suburbs outside of Washington D.C. and Long Island City in New York City's borough of Queens.The leaders of these cities should internalize warnings from Seattle. Commentators there have taken to calling Amazon's expansion a "prosperity bomb" reflecting both the massive impact of the company's growth and the heat of the ensuing fights about how that growth should be managed and distributed across the city.In one scenario Amazon could simply drop another prosperity bomb on these two already-prosperous markets producing a regressive explosion that heightens inequality spurs gentrification and diminishes social cohesion. In another scenario Amazon HQ2 and HQ3 could serve more as a controlled power source — one that economically energizes a broad base of residents and local communities.  How could a "grand bargain" like this unfold as Amazon and local leaders in New York and Virginia bear down on the final stretch? Here are three core pillars for local leaders and the company itself to consider:Use Amazon to seed the next Amazon and build wealth among local entrepreneursAmazon's presence will have a gravitational pull on other companies spin off new businesses and create demand for local suppliers. In Seattle Amazon has helped support the tech cluster by investing in the Alexa Accelerator a partnership with Techstars that helps startups incorporate Amazon's popular Alexa artificial intelligence platform into their businesses. Economic development organizations accelerators and incubators in each city can work to help nurture tech entrepreneurship around Amazon through similar partnerships.   Amazon's massive footprint will also create opportunities for local businesses in the winning city that do everything from food preparation to event planning to legal services. City officials should establish a mechanism to connect Amazon to local suppliers as the company considers procurement and vendor decisions at the new headquarters.Prepare current residents for employment opportunitiesOne of Amazon's biggest challenges is finding the necessary talent to support its growth and this presents a tremendous opportunity for local residents and leaders in education and training. Amazon should partner with local education workforce development and economic development entities to prepare as many current residents as possible for the tens of thousands of jobs these new locations will create. These partnerships can build from Amazon's technical apprenticeship program and draw upon leading-edge digital skill providers like Per Scholas and General Assembly already operating in the community.  Longer term Amazon should also co-invest in partnerships with local school districts to expose children to STEM education through mentorship programs with Amazon employees and career exposure days at the campus. Amazon could extend these efforts to formal work-based learning opportunities for young people such as internships externships and apprenticeships. Oftentimes these types of employer-educator partnerships exist as pockets of innovation but Amazon's resource base and talent requirements offer an opportunity for greater scale in these offerings.Boost housing supply to ameliorate growing painsEven with the most ambitious workforce development efforts imaginable most local residents will not directly benefit from Amazon's investment. For them there are well-founded concerns that their cost of living will increase as new arrivals bid up the price of housing. The good news as my colleague Jenny Schuetz notes is that Amazon's site selection team picked sites that were already planning for densification and new development. Yet even with expanded market-rate housing development HQ2 and HQ3 are still likely to exacerbate affordability challenges. A portion of the tax revenue generated by Amazon's arrival ought to be set aside for a fund to preserve and expand affordable housing. This summary of New York's proposal suggests that the city is intentionally leveraging Amazon to further broaden goals related to education and skills innovation and industry and neighborhood development. At this point many would point out that this entire process suggests that Amazon cares little about the well-being of US cities and has simply sought to extract the best deal for its bottom line. But here we are and leaders in Northern Virginia and New York have signed up to try to make this work. If done right these two global metros could invest in shared regional assets that not only benefit Amazon but also workers communities and other businesses.This story has been updated. ,Opinion
Brad Meltzer's thrillers including his newest "The Escape Artist" regularly land at the #1 spot on the bestseller list and he is also the author of the "Ordinary People Change the World" series. "I am Neil Armstrong" the latest in the series will be published September 11. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. (CNN)Neil Armstrong is making news again. Some might think it's because of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the moon landing or the new Ryan Gosling film "First Man" or especially the fact that Donald Trump is publicly complaining about said movie and whether or not the American flag has enough screen time. But in my mind the real reason Neil Armstrong is back is because we need him. More than ever. For years in our "I Am" book series I've studied and written about American heroes. If there's one thing I've learned it's this: You don't get the heroes you want; you get the heroes you need. So look around -- and look especially at Neil Armstrong's sudden resurgence. Certainly his greatest accomplishment was being the first person to walk on the moon. But in 2018 what's equally important are the lessons he gave us throughout his journey.Lesson #1 -- Humility mattersWhenever Armstrong talked about flying an aircraft or a spacecraft he used the term "we" -- not "I." He knew that every milestone he achieved required the help of so many others -- from scientists and engineers to welders and mathematicians to the tailors who sewed the spacesuits to all the astronauts from previous missions.When Apollo 11 was finally ready he said to the flight director "Please tell everyone who worked on this that this is their launch. Tell them they'll be riding with us all the way."Remember when our leaders used the term "we" rather than "I?"It was the same after he became famous. With his legendary moonwalk Armstrong became the most famous person in the world. But even then he never bragged never sold out and never put his face on T-shirts or opened a fast food joint with his name on it. He was humble.Remember when humility was an American virtue? Our leaders have lost this idea. We need to get it back. It's the only way we'll take off. Indeed Armstrong's sense of humility is why I decided to write "I am Neil Armstrong." I wanted to show my kids that Instagram fame isn't nearly as impressive as understated modesty.So how does that prove Armstrong is the hero we need today? Back during the 2016 election as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were bashing each other on a daily basis something surprising happened with the sales of our "I Am" books. Three books in particular started taking off: "I am George Washington" "I am Rosa Parks" and "I am Martin Luther King Jr." Parents and grandparents were tired of turning on the TV and seeing politicians. What they wanted to show their kids were leaders. How do I know? In twenty years as an author I've never sold out a book at Amazon. With the 2016 election Amazon was sold out of "I am Martin Luther King Jr." for nearly a month. For a full year after sales of all the books from George Washington to Rosa Parks to Abraham Lincoln skyrocketed.Throughout history heroes appear when there's a hunger. Right now whatever your political side America is starving for heroes. Especially humble ones.Lesson #2 -- Hard work mattersWhen Neil Armstrong was eight years old his goal was to climb a silver maple tree -- the biggest one in his backyard. It seemed impossible to young Neil. The tree was so big and he was small. How did he do it? He needed to be brave (though as a kid he was afraid of Santa Claus). He needed to be smart (in first grade he read more than 100 books). And he needed to be patient (he remained calm even when his frustrated brother kicked the table during Monopoly).But in order for Neil to get to the top of the tree he had to take that first step. To him climbing the tree was like a puzzle. He needed to pick the right branches in the right order. But on that day he was finally climbing the tree he grabbed a dead branch. The branch snapped and young Neil fell fifteen feet landing flat on his back.His sister came running. The wind was knocked out of him but he was okay. Still the most important thing young Neil did?He got back up again.Even as a child Armstrong knew success takes hard work. At ten years old he mowed grass at a cemetery for ten cents an hour. Then he worked at a bakery. With the money he earned he saved up for what he loved most: airplanes.First he collected toy planes. Then he saved for a flying license. Eventually he got his real pilot's license before he got his driver's license. From there he moved up to be a military pilot then a test pilot then of course to be an astronaut each step vital to helping him climb to the top.Today we love to tell the story of Neil Armstrong taking that giant leap for all mankind. But the only reason he got to take that leap is because of the thousands of smaller steps that came before it.Lesson 3 -- Instead of being loud be calmIn March of 1966 Neil Armstrong's first spaceflight was on the Gemini VIII. The goal was to fly alongside and dock with another spacecraft so they were both linked together. It was the first time two spacecraft ever connected in space. When they docked everyone started celebrating. But then suddenly there was a short circuit in one of their thrusters. The spacecraft became undocked and spun out of control.Even in this chaos Armstrong stayed perfectly calm. He kept his eyes on the controls firing a different thruster to stop their spin. Right there he learned another vital lesson: Nothing in space is easy.He saw that firsthand during his most famous moon landing. As the Lunar Module (Eagle) was headed to the moon's surface landing was challenging. Their radar and instruments weren't very accurate. They couldn't even tell how far they were from the moon's surface. Armstrong had to use a stopwatch and quick math to figure it out.Oh and did I mention they weren't close to NASA's planned landing spot? On top of all that the ground wasn't smooth. The moon rocks were as big as cars.Armstrong never panicked -- even when they had less than a minute of fuel left.Again Armstrong made it work.Today whether it's on Twitter or anywhere else we value those who are the loudest -- those who are best at getting noticed. But let's never forget -- and let's never stop teaching our kids -- that it's quite often the calm and quiet ones the hardest working ones and yes the most humble ones who offer America far more valuable lessons.,Opinion
Abigail McElroy is a senior at Strath Haven High School in Wallingford Pennsylvania. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. (CNN)I am not a piece of tape. This particular metaphor was a favorite of Amnion Pregnancy Center a crisis pregnancy center (or faux abortion clinic) that visited my health class sophomore year to talk about "healthy relationships." Even though more and more studies have shown that abstinence-only sex education impacts students negatively neither reducing teen pregnancy nor the transmission of STDs abstinence-only organizations still play an active role in sex education in my home state of Pennsylvania and across the United States.Recently many have resorted to scare tactics to convey their one main point: No one will love you if you have sex before marriage. They use disturbing metaphors to relay this frightening idea including comparing young women who have premarital sex to tape that has lost its critical feature -- its stickiness. When the Amnion representatives visited my school they went even further. They spent over an hour telling us that having sex would ruin us for our future spouses and warning us against the "steep slope of arousal." Because didn't you hear hand-holding and kissing are simply stepping stones to sex and we all but lack self-control.After Amnion's degrading presentation I contacted my high-school principal with my concerns about the quality of information and legitimacy of the organization but Amnion returned the next year. So I went one step further and attended the monthly school board meeting. During the open-mic section of the board's August meeting I got up to speak. I started by emphasizing the positive aspects of my school's sex education curriculum. While Pennsylvania standards only require that students learn about HIV STDs and abstinence my health class was relatively comprehensive including information about contraceptives LGBT terminology and drugs and alcohol. Next I highlighted how Amnion's presentation directly contradicted the choice-based curriculum my school had built. Amnion is one of thousands of crisis pregnancy centers in the United States or pro-life nonprofits that often pose as abortion clinics or licensed medical facilities with the active goal of stopping women from getting abortions. Its presentation preached that we are out of control and that abstinence is the only way to guarantee happily married lives. In short their organization seeks to manipulate women out of their right to choose.And Amnion's absurd claim that premarital sex makes people less able to form meaningful relationships poses real harm to all students especially those who have been victims of sexual assault. Not only did these students experience trauma but Amnion's premise asserts that their assaulters robbed their future spouses of intimacy and connection. By allowing Amnion to present year after year my school supported a group that put its religious beliefs above our right to complete information. Though Amnion tried to defend the program saying it was both "secular" and "factual" my school district chose to listen to me instead. Instead of shrugging off my concerns the board investigated and sought to resolve the problem both evaluating why it had happened in the first place and why it couldn't be allowed to continue. In the end the superintendent Lisa Palmer announced that Amnion would be banned from presenting in health class. In an email to the district's parents she wrote "Moving forward core sexual education topics will be covered by our own Wallingford-Swarthmore teachers not outside presenters. This will allow us to more closely control the information presented again with our goal of presenting factual balanced information that empowers our students to make healthy choices."But this is only the beginning. While students at my high school are now free from Amnion's fear-based presentations Amnion also speaks at 25 other area schools and it is just one of many crisis pregnancy centers in Pennsylvania. I am reaching out to friends across the state to expand my model of speaking at school board meetings with the goal of removing Amnion and similar crisis pregnancy centers from public high schools. I'm also leading a letter-writing campaign encouraging my state legislature to pass a bill mandating medically accurate sex education in all public schools. These changes would ensure that teenagers know that healthy relationships are built on communication and consent choice and confidence -- not fear. But this battle is about more than just high school sex education. Over the past month I've discovered that my voice will be heard if and when I raise it.  As the school year begins we as students need to remember that we all have voices. We need to speak to our partners and communicate well. We need to speak to our teachers and advocate for our needs. None of us are tape but we do have extraordinary power to bring people together.,Opinion
Pinar Tarhan is a freelance writer blogger screenwriter and novelist from Istanbul. She creates engaging lifestyle content and her bylines include The Washington Post The Billfold WOW! Women on Writing and OC87 Recovery Diaries among others. You can catch up with her on her blog Addicted to Writing or Twitter @zoeyclark. (CNN)"Sex and the City" celebrated its 20th anniversary this June. In Turkey the first episode aired 18 years ago on a paid subscription channel and I could watch every episode uncensored. This changed my life for the better. I was 15 and I'd never felt like I belonged. While Turkey and especially Istanbul has always had a contemporary and rebellious streak it was common to be surrounded by people who were just too narrow-minded. If they weren't religious they were conservative. And if they weren't conservative they had a collectivist nature. "What would the neighbors think?" "What would the relatives think?" I barely cared what my family thought of my lifestyle and personality. Enter Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte. While Charlotte's less adventurous sexual choices suited me better I related to the other three a lot more: A writer in love with clothes and shoes who arguably dated the hottest men. A gorgeous and successful woman who didn't give a damn what anybody else thought and lived her life the way she wanted it. A successful career woman whose cynicism I appreciated much more as I grew older. Coming from Turkey "Sex and The City" provided more than just funny and stylish escapism; it made me feel liberated. It allowed me and my friends to talk about anything and everything without shame. And mine isn't the only country it helped.That's why it feels weird when I come across articles calling the women on the show evil. Even articles that emphasized the show's impact and relevance like this one from The Independent had entries like this: "Why did it focus on four white women? It was set in one of the most diverse cities in the world did it never occur to the production team that it might be an idea to include someone of a different ethnicity?"These points are valid but they didn't even cross my mind when I watched the show then. Maybe because I'm never quite represented on TV anyway. An agnostic Turkish woman who loves wearing sexy clothes? A busy freelancer in her 30s who doesn't want children? A romantic who doesn't care if she ever gets married? Someone with OCD who manages it well? The truth is more often than not I don't want to see myself the way I am on the screen. I want a happier healthier version who has fewer difficult problems and has more dating options.  The women of "Sex and the City" were beautiful (mostly) healthy white women with good jobs and I loved every second of their (mis)adventures even the cringeworthy ones. If we have to dig into what they did wrong according to today's values let's not forget all the risks they took and the taboos they broke. Criticism of "Sex and the City" cover everything from homophobia to general superficialness. But the truth is for every problematic joke scene and storyline singled out I can come up with at least 10 examples where the show was progressive or compassionate.Samantha dated a black man and it ended because his sister didn't want a "white chick" dating her brother. She defined herself as "try-sexual;" she'd try anything once. She once dated a woman. Miranda took care of the ailing mother of her boyfriend. Carrie broke up with someone because he slapped her. Carrie's best guy friend was gay; Charlotte converted to Judaism for the man she loved. The show openly talked about abortion."Sex and the City" put four women front and center unapologetically beingthemselves flaws and all. It was the first show where men saw themselves being talked about as sex objects as well as a show that made them face their toxic behavior.And while the women could be vulgar judgmental and occasionally cruel they loved each other. Their friendship saw them through break-ups career ups and downs cancer wild disagreements infertility and beyond.As a big fan I'll admit the show had its issues even if we judged the show by the 90's and early 00's standards. Carrie cheated on her serious boyfriend Aidan having an affair with Mr. Big while he was married. Not to mention Samantha cheated on Smith with Richard the guy she had broken up with because he had cheated on her.The way Carrie put up with Big's ridiculous behavior let me down. He strung her along gave her mixed signals and didn't involve her in his life. The same went for all the women in the show. They were beautiful smart and independent and yet they tolerated a lot of unstable and unattractive behavior from men. What kind of message were they sending to the millions of women watching the series worldwide?But because these characters represented extremes and were so different from one another we got entertaining TV. You can't keep people tuning in episode after episode for years without conflict. You need political incorrectness and controversy to hook the audiences. You need mistakes and you need characters to mess things up around the clock. Whether it was grossly mishandling their finances committing adultery or insulting the looks of the man they loved the women did a lot of horrible things.While "Sex and the City" had problematic characters and storylines it would be a mistake to ignore all of the ways that it helped to usher in new groundbreaking series by exploring themes like sexuality friendship parenthood and interracial dating in ways that we hadn't seen before. And let's not forget the laughs. There were plenty of laughs.,Opinion
This piece is the third part of a CNN Opinion series "What it's like to be me" which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. E. Wesley Ely is a physician and the Grant. W. Liddle Professor of Medicine and Critical Care at Vanderbilt University Tennessee Valley VA GRECC and the founder of the Vanderbilt ICU Delirium and Cognitive Impairment Study Group. The views expressed here are solely his. (CNN)"But can't you help me die Doc?" My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed gasping staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways despite our best treatments. As a newly minted doctor years ago my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients' care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed.  That is what I try to do as a physician including of course what they tell me in the silences.  I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level.  His face was blank.  "I want euthanasia. I'm going to die soon so what's the point of living longer? I'm just wasted space." I felt nauseated.  The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind.  Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.  I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father an engineer had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days we'd walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn't pay anything to Mom who didn't make much as a teacher.  So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store. While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided I was determined to do something different with my life.  Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people science and the arts. To me that meant medicine. I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician one has constantly to seek truth about the patient's diagnosis the best treatment and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn't change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: "Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right." Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person's life has value beyond measure.I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn't kill another person just because he or she wanted me to but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul's request to die.'Just don't abandon me'My response came in parts over my days with him.  First I explained that as his physician I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant.  We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected but I would never intentionally harm him. "Paul our covenant includes my limiting your suffering" I said.  "You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress but we won't deliberately end your life." With our eyes locked Paul gave his instruction: "Just don't abandon me."  And we sat there as partners.As a physician there is no better place to be.  Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship.  He in need of help and me in need of helping.  Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms but it wasn't enough.  It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease.  Physicians fail our patients on a human level.  We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art music spirituality pets sunshine — that might help him.   'He who has a "why" to live can bear almost any "how"' "I want my music.  Can you get me the soundtrack for 'Lord of the Rings'?"  Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged.  "I love music. It's always been a motivator but now ... I don't know." He shifted in his bed. "My goals are gone."Nietzsche's words came to my mind "He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how.'" Viktor Frankl as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz used Nietzsche's quote four times in his crucial analysis "Man's Search for Meaning." I think this book should be required reading for medical students.As with many patients Paul's story needed unpacking. "Paul what did you do in life?" He smiled and shrugged. "I'm a rare beast: a plumber who acts.  I do Shakespeare festivals.  You know 'The quality of mercy is not strained.'  I've been mulling over that line.  Years ago I didn't understand it.  I do now.  Mercy should not be forced.  It's better as a natural infusion one person to another." I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director helping her cue actors.  As we talked I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover obliging us to take breaks.  Sweat would build up on his forehead and more than once I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking and it was essential.The quality of mercyThat night I asked Christine a nurse who loves theater to sit and talk with Paul.  Soon their lives were interwoven too. "I think I helped Christine" Paul said the next day. "My own illness made me forget that one of my 'things' is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar.  I told her my way through the worst of it." He paused his thoughts far away.It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request.  "Paul you've asked for euthanasia and you brought up Portia's line from 'Merchant of Venice' about mercy.  Can we talk about these things?"  He nodded and closed his eyes."We all want to be here with you in your suffering.  I want your opinion: I don't think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful but it would in every sense of the word be 'strained.' It would be a forced and unnatural 'false' mercy.  Whenever possible mercy must also be lifting and healing.  I don't want to abandon those key elements in serving you."His eyes opened wide. "Doc talking with you and Christine about life's best and worst times has helped."  He took a deep breath and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils.  "Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she's coming back tonight and that means the world to me."  Then unwittingly Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: "When we met I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I'm not a believer like others but I guess I remembered the 'why' to live." Short of a war zone there are few settings as raw as an ICU.  Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their "why" even if just for an hour or a day.  'I'm glad I didn't miss this time'I see many paths toward survival in the ICU and for non-survivors myriad paths toward death: sudden prolonged stuttering reluctant stoical -- and these paths are dynamic not static.It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering.  Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain. Lack of control is what bothers people the most and it drives most requests for euthanasia which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon.  As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate.  As a physician I find this is a very important "teachable moment" for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind and I recalled them for Paul: "Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin." He nodded in agreement.Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of 'cure' when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.And alongside the patient of course sits the physician.  The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer.  I would be qualitatively changed.  If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately it would for me create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness.  The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are. Obviously the approach I took with Paul won't be an answer for everyone yet it is too often left untried.  Some will say Paul's story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients and I hope my colleagues do the same. We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible.  What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression but a person's sense of insignificance and hopelessness which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact the last thing he said to me between gasps was: "I'm glad I didn't miss this time. I never saw it coming Doc. ... In losing my breath I gained it." Note: The patient's name and age have been changed for privacy.  These conversations reproduce Paul's words as accurately as possible from the author's memory.,Opinion
 (CNN)Sometimes Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  "I wanted to sit with my good good friends but I couldn't" the 10-year-old said.  "If you're a kid and you have a food allergy it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff." Mom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. "We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction" Glover said and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests. The discovery was "distressing" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened resulting in "severe stomach cramps and vomiting" she said. "Essentially we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening."Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk it was "a gift" she said adding that her family hoped their efforts might help "lots of other children."The risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen the researchers found.  Ellis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. "It's been a huge success" her mother said.The study results published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.Not a cureDr. Brian Vickery the study's lead author director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine cautioned that "it's not a cure." "It does not make the allergy to go away" Vickery said. "The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want." Still that's no small accomplishment he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular which along with tree nut allergy affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more. Aimmune Therapeutics Inc. the California-based biopharmaceutical company that made the experimental product will be submitting an application for marketing approval to the FDA in December and the FDA has designated the treatment as worthy of an expedited approval process. "I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer something like that" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children adults would probably benefit in the same way.How the study workedTo test the experimental therapy 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 554 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 496 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.  The treatment which comes in powder-filled capsules is an oral immunotherapy and the concept is "treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to" Vickery said. Essentially the treatment is a peanut powder. Ellis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital."We were extremely well-informed about the entire process" Glover said. "You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then you take it at home every day. " Two-thirds of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year all of the participants faced an "exit food challenge": They ate under a doctor's supervision the equivalent of two peanuts. Two-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose. Overall participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. "It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects such as stomachache.Ellis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. "Having stomach cramps did not feel very good" she said. Still she usually vomited and the cramps passed quickly. Once she felt her throat constrict and "it was harder for me to breathe" she said. She'd gone into anaphylaxis a severe allergic reaction. The hospital staff reacted immediately and gave her a shot of epinephrine. "I felt safe with all the doctors and nurses around me. They can help you get through it" she said.A little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge compared with 53% in the placebo group."These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives" Vickery said "and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized." Trying to be 'bite safe'Dr. Scott Sicherer a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York said the study is "the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut."   "It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches" said Sicherer who was not involved in the study. "It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad."Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts you could have a severe reaction at home. "This is not something to try at home" Sicherer said.Aimmune has made peanut into a "pharmaceutical-grade" product he said. "Most people think of it as medicinalized food." Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting he said "and that's important because if you're reactive to say a 50th of a peanut you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut."Assuming the treatment wins FDA approval Sicherer said the conversation between doctors and patients will be "Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?" There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one it's "a commitment" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising and you can't skip doses or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.Glover noted "It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally we would take it after dinner."  After giving the medicine she added parents must carefully monitor their children preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.Sicherer said "The family that does this really really really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy."  It would still be worth it to many he said.If this ends up being the first approved treatment if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear "that would be so amazing because we haven't really had anything like that before" he said."It's not everything we would hope for but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more" said Sicherer who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time:  "I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them but if not we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road."Glover acknowledges that "it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study just in terms of a time commitment." Still if it had taken twice the amount of time she would have done it: "It's peace of mind."Even though she dislikes the medicine's taste Ellis also believes it is worth it. "It's definitely better" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: "You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.",Health
 (CNN)The death toll from the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo continues to rise as violence hampers health workers' efforts to battle the virus.There are now 358 cases of Ebola and 213 deaths since the outbreak began in August according to the nation's Ministry of Health. Conflict between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas.Operations suspendedOn Friday evening an armed group tried to attack UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni in North Kivu province -- the epicenter of the outbreak.The attack occurred near the Ebola Response Emergency Operations Center and hotels where many Ebola health workers are staying according to the health ministry. The peacekeepers were able to push the attackers back after several hours of clashes but all field activities were suspended in Beni Saturday due to the violence. The Emergency Operations Center remained closed and teams had to stay in their hotels.Earlier in the week at least seven peacekeepers were killed and 10 others were wounded in a coordinated military attack on rebel forces the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo said.The peacekeeping outfit has partnered with Congolese armed forces in an operation to dislodge the rebel Allied Democratic Forces and "restore peace and stability in the Beni area" the UN said in a statement. Deadly violence in the Congo's North Kivu province has hampered efforts to stamp out the Ebola virus the country's Minister of Public Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga said.Infants among deadThe outbreak -- the second this year -- began in North Kivu province before spreading to Ituri province in the east of the country. This is the 10th time since 1976 that Ebola has struck the Congo.Of all the reported cases 311 so far have been confirmed as Ebola and 47 are probable. Among the deaths 166 are confirmed as having been caused by Ebola and 47 are probable according to the nation's health ministry.Among those killed in the outbreak are pregnant and breastfeeding women newborns and infants the World Health Organization reported. More than 30 health workers also have been infected according to the WHO.Fear of spreadCongo shares borders with nine nations and the United Nations fears the Ebola epidemic could spread to South Sudan as well due to the influx of Congolese refugees.Doctors Without Borders is on the ground in the Congo and has also deployed teams to neighboring Uganda though no cases have been confirmed there so far. Still the World Health Organization said Thursday that "the risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as to neighboring countries remains very high."Kalenga the health minister posted a video on the Health Ministry's Facebook page early Saturday calling for communities to be vigilant and report any signs of illness. "Community-based surveillance is at the heart of the new response strategy against #Ebola. Each inhabitant at his level can protect his family and neighborhood against the virus by reporting any alert and suspicious cases to emergency teams. All the leaders of the #beni neighborhoods work alongside us in the response" he wrote.The virusEbola first appeared in 1976 in Sudan and Congo and gets its name from a river in the latter nation. It is one of the world's most virulent diseases and is transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected people.Ebola causes fever severe headaches and in some cases hemorrhaging. It spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids or objects contaminated by someone ill with the disease. In some cases the virus is spread through contact with someone who has died from the disease. The virus enters the body through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes nose or mouth. It can also spread through sexual contact.,Health
Battle Mountain Nevada (CNN)Route 305 is a seemingly nondescript stretch of road in the middle of a very empty state connecting two small towns. But in the middle of this desolate valley of brown-yellow scrub brush amid cows and wooden telephone poles and with views of dirt-brown hills there's a windy 5-mile stretch of flat highway where world records are broken every year.Since 2000 the World Human Powered Speed Challenge (originally called the World's Fastest Bicycle Competition) has gathered university teams and enterprising individuals who have engineered various bikes to be the fastest any human has traveled without the aid of an engine.The bicycle is arguably one of the greatest inventions of mankind. An average bike is five times more efficient than walking when you compare the energy consumed to cross a mile. And although the design hasn't changed much over the past 100 years -- because it hasn't needed to -- the exception to that lies among a small international clan getting close to breaking a 90-mile per hour speed barrier. "Aerodynamic drag is 80% of what holds you back when you ride a 10-speed" explained Alan Krause co-director of the challenge along with his wife Alice. Therefore for teams and individuals designing bicycles to be the fastest in the world most of the battle is focused on reducing wind resistance. They build custom aerodynamic shells around the bikes and require riders to get as low and recumbent as possible without losing too much stability. Competing against natureThe way the challenge works is that over seven days the attempts are made individually rather than racing side by side. The cyclists are competing for records in various categories which means they compete with one another with their own personal records the limits of innovation and against the natural elements. "They are competing against the forces of nature against air" Krause said.In addition to men and women's standard "open class" speed categories there's a category for bikes with more than two wheels "multitrack"; the tandem category has two or more cyclists; and there's a category for bikes that use hand cranks instead of traditional pedals. Each category has its own world record holders for males and females and nearly every year at least one world record is broken. Race organizers close Route 305 for up to 20 minutes at a time and try to get four bikes in each of these heats. There are only about 16 attempts available in the morning and evening which are the best times to race. Mornings are better for low wind but it's also colder which makes the air more dense. Racers tend to go a bit faster in the evening heats.The bikes look like elongated eggs or upside-down canoes but they have human passenger/engines inside. Team members either help the rider squeeze in or lift the top of the shell over them and tape down the seams.The bikes are a bit tipsy when they start requiring crews to run-push them off (for no more than 15 meters). They have 5 miles to build up velocity and then a trap captures their official speed in the last 200 meters (just under the length of two football fields). If the wind is over 6 kilometers per hour in any direction the whole run is disqualified. "The aerodynamics of the bikes allow you to stay at a constant speed fairly easily so you want to slowly build up speed all the way down until you're only 1 mile left and then you want to start sprinting. That way you don't wear yourself out" said competitor Ishtey Amminger of Memphis Tennessee and team Gee Bee.Accidents are common mostly at the start. Because a minor mechanical issue or even strong wind can cause a bike to tip or run off the road anywhere on the course each racer must have a chase vehicle follow them. "It's just such a surreal experience. You're in this thing that looks like an egg ... going down a highway in the middle of nowhere and it only takes a tiny bit of wind to blow it slightly off course" said Karen Darke a racer from Scotland with the University of Liverpool team.Options are limited for spectators even though they are encouraged to come and cheer on the riders. Portable stands at the finish line are the tallest visible structure in the valley and they held a couple of dozen fans this year some wisely staying warm under blankets as the sun began to set. At the starting line there's no place to sit but there's more action there: racers doing laps on shell-less practice bikes and then when it's their turn scrambling to get in position. And then the occasional if inevitable wobble-and-falls at the start. The World Human Powered Speed Challenge ended up on Route 305 after an exhaustive effort by an engineer named Matt Weaver who drove around California and Nevada in 1994 recording highway data. He found in this stretch one of the longest straightest and flattest. For any speed record attempt the maximum grade allowed by the  International Human Powered Vehicle Association is two-thirds percent a very slight slope. Route 305 is also above 4000 feet high a good altitude for thinner air.A nearly $4 million grant made on behalf of the organizers in 2009 led to a repavement of the highway in which asphalt was poured without a single seam for nearly 6 miles. Steel mile markers were replaced with plastic ones to reduce accidents and injuries. But nine years later the public use highway is showing signs of wear and tear. It was Weaver's data that led to the first call to competitors 19 years ago. Today the challenge is an open invitational. Anyone can try to qualify simply by reaching on a 2½-mile short track a speed of 45 mph in morning heats and 60 mph in evening heats. "A great athlete on a regular bicycle won't top 45 miles an hour in this contest" Krause said.Fifteen riders came from 11 teams this year representing the United States Canada Mexico Italy England France and the Netherlands. The teams name their bikes such as the Velox 7  Wahoo Eta Prime Dos to the Tres Super Ketta 162 Taurus and Blue Nose. The current top speed record holder is Todd Reichert who reached 89.59 mph in 2016. (Route 305's automobile speed limit is 70 mph.) But other world records were broken this year. Ken Talbot's 51.58 mph is now the world speed record for men's arm-powered category. Using the same bike the Arion4 Darke broke her own record by reaching 46.54 mph in women's arm-powered. And Amminger broke the junior (under age 18) multitrack record at 60.94 mph on a three-wheel bike called CO2.Announcements organizing for the next day's heats and an opportunity for all the teams to mingle take place after each heat at the Battle Mountain Civic Center. It's a convivial well-organized affair with the Krauses in charge. Newcomers ask advice of elders who are happy to answer.Blowin' through the windThe International Human Powered Vehicle Association's broad definition of a bike brings the concept to an existential point. Some of the bikes don't have pedals. The rules don't even require wheels even though they always have. "If it had skis it would be a land vehicle in the open class" Krause said. And the bikes can have more than two wheels; in a recent year one (non-record-breaking) entrant had at least seven. That said most of the current designs are made of recognizable bike parts if in different positions. No one has built a chain configuration that can beat circular. "While there have been experiments with linear drives ones with a straight-line pedal path no linear drive has equaled the performance of traditional bicycle cranks" Krause said. Speed enhancements tend to largely focus on designs to reduce wind resistance. The holy grail aerodynamically speaking is "laminar flow" a state in which a bike shell shape achieves very little wind resistance. Even a dead insect on the shell can mess up that ideal state of flow. It's an engineering challenge worthy of Elon Musk who will probably show up as soon as he learns of it.Because the bubble of a window adds drag many of bikes are fully enclosed the driver navigating by screen and a video camera.Weight is another factor. The world's fastest bikes are now made from high-tech and aerospace composite materials such as Kevlar carbon fiber and foam cores. "You really have to work on design and efficiency. You can't just throw more horsepower behind it" Krause said.But the final component is being in proper shape for a burst of energy required in the few minutes it takes to build up speed. There are few rules but of course the main one is that the bike may not contain an engine or "stored energy" as one crew member called it. Do you have the need? The need for speed?To make an attempt at a bike speed record you don't have to go to Nevada in September. If you meet the proper conditions have proper timing equipment and get it cleared by international association you can make an attempt closer to home. What is helpful about the World Human Powered Speed Challenge is that those requirements are taken care of by the organizers. All the racers have to do is show up.Competitors tend to be elite ath-geeks at the intersection of amateur athletes and engineers and home builders the kind of people who enjoy poring over technical trade publications with detailed black and white photos and titles such as CyclingScience Bicycling Science and Human Power available at the Battle Mountain Civic Center gatherings.Being in shape and getting in miles on training bikes similar to the final racing designs is also key to having any chance at making history in the desert. "It's a unique combination of athleticism and engineering. Both are critical to the performance" Krause said. "There's a mental component too" he added. The experience is scary for some claustrophobic for others. "These bikes are uncomfortable to be in. They're very cramped. There's no air and some wear oxygen masks."Darke noted "after I tried it for the first proper run I was shaking for hours afterwards. I was really psyched out by it. I think maybe some of this is more psychological than physical."Although a bike must pass a tech inspection to make sure it can stop and turn there are virtually no safety rules other than a bike helmet. Seat restraint requirements may be coming. On the highway organizers add wood boards to the bottom of guard rails to keep sideways-sliding bikes from slipping under them and falling into a ravine. Crashes can of course occur at very high speeds but injuries are typically not serious usually just minor abrasions and burns. One of the worst accidents a couple of years ago occurred just after the finish line when the bike "exploded" Krause said but the rider had no broken bones and mainly minor concussion symptoms due to the abrupt stop.As Mario Andretti one of the fasted motor-powered speed champions put it: "If things seem under control you are just not going fast enough." ,Health
 (CNN)Due to the wildfires raging in Northern California San Francisco Stockton and Sacramento were the world's three "most polluted cities" on Friday morning according to Berkeley Earth a nonprofit that aggregates data from air-quality monitoring sites. PurpleAir which has a network of sensors around the world also showed that California had worse air than traditional smog hotspots in India and China.CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller confirmed that "no region on Earth had as many air quality stations in the highest ranges" of particulate matter or PM the toxic mixture of particles and droplets that worsens after wildfires. Those values he said "stretched for hundreds of miles over Northern and Central California from the mountains to the valleys and the coast."Schools colleges and public transit have closed as smoke from the Camp Fire descends on the region. "It appears to be the worst air quality ever experienced in San Francisco" said Dan Jaffe a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Washington. He called the situation "an air quality emergency" and experts said the smoke could undo decades of progress on pollution."We have made tremendous efforts and investment to clean up our air with considerable benefits for public health" said Dr. Daniel Jacob a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering at Harvard University. "But now it's like we're getting stabbed in the back with those wildfires."Some call cancellations 'too little too late'San Francisco's transit agency has taken its cable cars off the streets several schools have canceled classes and the National Park service suspended tours to Alcatraz Island.Public schools in San Francisco and Alameda County were closed Friday along with UC Davis and UC Merced. UC Berkeley also canceled Friday's classes but some students criticized the university's decision to stay open Thursday as smoke descended on the campus.The school's student association wrote a letter to their chancellor denouncing the "administration's insufficient response to these public health risks" and urging administrators to allocate emergency funds for masks and mobile air filtration units."Campus buildings are not equipped to filter out the pollutants making the air indoors just as harmful as it is outside" the group wrote. Some students even those without pre-existing conditions said they felt sick."I had a bloody throat bloody nose a cough dry and watering eyes and my throat is still very sore and dry" freshman Sabrina Thorn said. "I almost passed out trying to go to class yesterday. My professor told me to go home."Students struggle to find respiratorsThorn's sorority sister gave her a mask but freshman Samantha Greene said that other students have struggled to find them. That's because the university's health service is not distributing them to all students -- just those with medical conditions like asthma."There are over 40000 students at the university" spokesman Dan Mogulof said "and we just don't have access to masks of that number."Some students though still think the school needs to be doing more."I have many friends who have been coughing up blood and [were] forced to seek emergency medical help because of the air and Berkeley's unwillingness to act" Greene said.The student association itself decided to hand out masks Thursday she said leading to large crowds as people "desperately [tried] to get respirators from [the] student-run club which ran out in the first five minutes and turned into a mob scene."In stores near Berkeley masks also quickly sold out Greene said leading to "an absurd sort of competition between students to get one." Students lucky enough to get the masks she said were trying to sell them at "absurd prices."In a message to students announcing Friday's cancellation the school's chancellor Carol Christ said Thursday that Berkeley had "a limited supply of appropriate 'N-95' respirators available for those students with medical conditions that may make them particularly susceptible to the impact of degraded air quality."Greene called that "too little too late" and said masks are still difficult to come by. The university told students that "even these relatively advanced masks provide limited protection and are not a substitute for staying indoors." Jaffe however said that "the masks definitely help" if worn properly and are "better than nothing" although staying in a building with filtered air offers the best protection.The university for its part says it's doing the best it can. "Our students like our staff our faculty and our neighbors are without a doubt being impacted by one of the greatest natural disasters in California's history" Mogulof said. "The university just does not have the ability to completely mitigate the impacts of this wildfire." Staying safe in the smokeParticulate matter is the "number one environmental killer in the world" Jacob said and "the levels that are present in those areas affected by wildfires are like you might expect on a very polluted day in China or India."Smoke from fires releases particles small enough to make their way through our nose and into our lungs Jaffe added and "young children and the elderly have the greatest risks for immediate health concerns."PM can aggravate asthma decrease lung function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke according to a study published last year in the Lancet. And because children with developing airways breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults they can experience more severe symptoms. "We give people advice to say indoors and to reduce exercise and things like that" Jaffe said "but those don't mitigate the problem too much." That's especially true in San Francisco where many don't have air conditioning. Without any sort of "controlled system" to filter air Jaffe said a building doesn't offer much protection against particulate matter. When air is properly filtered though people can "reduce their PM exposure by about 90%" by being inside he said.If you have to go outside Jaffe recommends an N95 respirator a specially designed mask that provides "very efficient filtration of airborne particles" when worn correctly according to the Food and Drug Administration.The agency warns that "a proper fit cannot be achieved on children and people with facial hair" which means the masks "may not provide full protection" for those people.But even if you are able to protect your lungs Jaffe said diminished air quality can be demoralizing. "There's a mental health issue too" he said. "Everybody is unhappy and it's hard to enjoy life."CNN's Amanda Watts Jill Martin and Ashley Strickland contributed to this report. ,Health
 (CNN)With Thanksgiving just around the corner the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has recalled turkey products linked to a salmonella outbreak.Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales LLC recalled 91388 pounds of raw ground turkey products after the USDA found that a sample of the products tested positive for a salmonella reading matching the outbreak strain. The samples were from a Sept. 11 2018 production and according to the USDA the rest of the products shipped nationwide. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first announced the outbreak linked to raw turkey products in July but more people have gotten sick bringing the total to at least 164 in 35 states. One person in California has died and 63 people have been hospitalized.The outbreak started in November 2017. It's unclear where the turkey at the center of this outbreak came from as there doesn't appear to be one centralized distributor the agency said. This could mean that "it might be widespread in the turkey industry."Lab tests show that the salmonella came from a variety of products including ground turkey and turkey patties. Tests showed that it's also been in live turkeys and pet food.The US Department of Agriculture and the CDC have been working with the industry asking what steps could be taken to reduce this kind of contamination and the investigation is ongoing.Symptoms of salmonella infection include fever diarrhea and stomach cramps and they usually last four to seven days. Most people recover without treatment. In rare cases the infection can cause death if a patient is not treated promptly with antibiotics.There are an estimated 1.2 million salmonella cases in the United States annually and various foods are to blame for about 1 million of those illnesses according to the CDC.The CDC said that if you plan to handle raw turkey make sure you are extra careful: Wash your hands after touching it. Cook products thoroughly to avoid getting sick. Thaw turkeys in the refrigerator not on the counter.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the number of cases of salmonella linked to this outbreak.,Health
 (CNN)Vaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year prompting the US Food and Drug Administration to propose new measures against flavored nicotine products that have propelled the rise the agency announced Thursday."These data shock my conscience" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement proposing to strengthen the agency's policies against flavored e-cigarette products. These proposals could ultimately prompt their removal from shelves and websites that are accessible to minors.The proposed changes do not include mint menthol and tobacco flavors however. Gottlieb said he wanted to leave the door open for adults who might use these products to quit smoking cigarettes "but it can't come at the expense of addicting a generation of kids on nicotine" he told CNN on Thursday. Despite these exceptions for e-cigarette flavors Gottlieb proposed additional bans on regular menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars.He also proposed tightening the reins on products that are marketed or "appealing to youth.""This could include using popular children's cartoon or animated characters or names of products favored by kids like brands of candy or soda" the announcement said.Consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate about vaping: While some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults others say there's no good evidence to support this."We're committed to utilizing the full range of our regulatory authorities to directly target the places kids are getting these products and address the role flavors and marketing are playing" Gottlieb said in a statement."We will leave no stone unturned" he said. "This is one of our highest priorities."'Spike in use'One in five high schoolers has vaped in the past month according to the new numbers announced by the FDA and released in conjunction with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."I'm also a father of young kids and every time I go home and talk to parents of other kids ... this is the number one thing I hear about" Gottlieb told CNN. "Parents are deeply concerned about the trends that they're seeing in their high schools in their middle schools."Health experts worry that these products could put kids' developing brains at risk get them hooked on nicotine early in life and be a gateway to smoking and other drugs."The data show that kids using e-cigarettes are going to be more likely to try combustible cigarettes later" Gottlieb said in a statement. "This is a large pool of future risk."The new statistics also show that students who vape are doing so more frequently than last year and they are using flavored liquids more often according to the FDA. More than a quarter of current users vaped at least 20 of the last 30 days and over two-thirds had used flavored products."Flavors are a major reason they use these products in the first place" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday. "Flavors increase the likelihood of kids progressing from experimentation to regular use and a portion of them will go on to use combustible tobacco products with the huge added dangers of tobacco-related disease."The new numbers come from a school-based survey conducted from March to May which revealed that the number of current users in middle and high school -- meaning those who have vaped in the past 30 days -- increased 48% and 78% from last year respectively. In other words the number of current vapers in middle and high school has jumped by roughly 1.5 million since last year now totaling 3.6 million kids Gottlieb said.The "alarming" surge in adolescent e-cigarette use prompted health officials to release these numbers "earlier than usual" in hopes of spurring immediate action according to the FDA."Not only are we seeing a staggering increase in the number of high schoolers who use e-cigarettes we're seeing that more and more of them have moved beyond experimentation and are using e-cigarettes almost daily" Dr. Colleen A. Kraft president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement.The rapid spread of e-cigarettes -- which work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes -- was flagged in a 2016 report by the US surgeon general that cited a 900% increase in e-cigarette use by high school students from 2011 to 2015. E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady -- under 12% -- the following year. Now that number is 20.8%.Gottlieb worries that soaring e-cigarette use will undermine the progress on youth anti-smoking efforts over the years."The rate of use of e-cigarettes among kids threatens to reverse those gains" he told CNN. "We simply cannot let that happen."Too little too late?Health and advocacy groups had mixed responses after news reports last week foreshadowed Thursday's policy-related announcement. Some applauded the proposals but those organizations also chided the agency for stopping short and not acting sooner."Even with new sales restrictions teens will still find ways to purchase flavored e-cigarettes" Kraft said. The proposed policy revision wouldn't apply to vaping products "sold exclusively in age-restricted locations -- for instance a stand-alone tobacco retailer (such as a vape shop)" the announcement said. Critics say this could shift the problem out of some storefronts but not out of existence."The FDA needs to go further" Matthew L. Myers president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement Friday. "There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales."The FDA has cracked down on vape shops in the past issuing warnings and fines to more than 1300 retailers for illegally selling vaping products to kids after an undercover investigation this summer.Myers urged the FDA to ban all flavored vaping products whose impact on public health hasn't been scrutinized by the FDA "as the law requires ... rather than dealing with them after they have become popular with kids as in the case of Juul."Instead of requiring e-cigarettes to undergo FDA approval before they could be sold the agency decided in 2017 that it would allow such products to stay on shelves until 2022 without pre-market review.This decision has also been the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the FDA and Health and Human Services filed in March by health advocacy groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the earlier requirement for pre-market approval. Under Gottlieb's latest proposal the FDA's less-stringent approach would no longer apply to flavored products whose companies don't take these steps to avoid underage use."We hope that within the next 90 days manufacturers will choose to remove flavored [e-cigarette] products from stores where kids can access them and from online sites that do not have sufficiently robust age-verification procedures" Gottlieb said in a statement.He told CNN "If we don't see the youth use rates start to come down -- and come down sharply -- we'll be back here because there is more that we can do."Menthol"I'm deeply concerned about the availability of menthol-flavored cigarettes" Gottlieb said Thursday. "I believe these menthol-flavored products represent one of the most common and pernicious routes by which kids initiate on combustible cigarettes."Moreover I believe that menthol products disproportionately and adversely affect underserved communities."On Wednesday the NAACP released a statement in support of the FDA's then-anticipated plan to ban menthol cigarettes saying that "the tobacco industry has successfully and intentionally marketed mentholated cigarettes to African Americans."Nearly one in five African-Americans smoked menthols in 2010 representing more than 80% of black smokers according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.In a statement Thursday R.J. Reynolds which manufactures the top-selling menthol cigarette in the US denied that the evidence supports regulating menthols differently from other cigarettes. The company said it "will continue to engage with the FDA on its proposed plans" and asserted that regulating menthol cigarettes would "increase the illegal market fueling more criminal activity." The company has fought previous similar efforts contributing nearly $12 million against a San Francisco proposition to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products which voters approved in June. Citing the popularity of menthol cigarettes among African-Americans and youth National Urban League CEO and President Marc H. Morial urged the FDA "to move forward with urgency to implement this plan" in a statement Tuesday."The destructive impact of menthol cigarettes on the African-American community is clear" Morial said.'Not enough'Vaping associations criticized the FDA's announcement Thursday."No youth should vape and there is room for more rigorous enforcement to ensure youth are not accessing these products. However this move by Commissioner Gottlieb will only serve to make it harder for adult smokers to switch to a far less harmful alternative" Gregory Conley president of the American Vaping Association said in a statement."Allowing convenience stores to continue selling mint and menthol pods is hardly a compromise worthy of applause" he said.In an emailed statement the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that it disagrees with the limitations Gottlieb has proposed -- though it has also taken a stance against flavors and marketing geared toward kids. "We strongly disagree that e-Vapor products are a gateway product" said the association which encouraged more partnership between the FDA and the industry.Pharmacy chain CVS Health which does not sell tobacco or vaping products supported the move. Its chief medical officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said that the company applauds "the FDA's decision to restrict access to flavored tobacco and e-cigarette products which have been expertly marketed and targeted at teens and young adults.""The need for action is urgent" Nancy Brown CEO of the American Heart Association said in a statement Thursday. "But limiting the sale of e-cigarettes is not enough."The FDA should also remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market" she added "and prohibit companies from marketing their products in ways that appeal to kids."Other actionsThe agency has made a number of moves in recent months to counter vaping among kids beyond warning and fining retailers for illegally selling e-cig products to kids.It recently expanded its investigation into e-cigarette companies sending letters to 21 companies last month in an effort to uncover whether they are marketing products illegally and outside the agency's compliance policy. That move came less than two weeks after the agency conducted a surprise inspection of Juul's corporate headquarters in San Francisco seizing thousands of documents many of which relate to its sales and marketing practices.This month Gottlieb announced a public hearing in December that will "focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation among youth."Gottlieb has met with companies like Juul asking them to to address what he described as a mutual goal to keep e-cigs out of kids' hands. But some have been critical of these efforts with one anti-tobacco advocate comparing them to "asking the fox to recommend plans for guarding the hen house."The leading maker of e-cigarettes Juul vowed on Tuesday to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website. The company also announced that it was shutting down some of its social media accounts."Underage use of e-cigarette products is a problem that requires immediate action" Juul Labs said in a statement Thursday. "That is why we implemented our action plan."Altria Group the parent company of Philip Morris also recently announced that it was pulling a number of flavored vaping products from shelves until it receives FDA authorization or "when the youth issue is addressed" according to a statement from Chairman and CEO Howard Willard.CNN's Ben Tinker and Susan Scutti contributed to this report. ,Health
 (CNN)Despite their new-found independence the Bhutanese conjoined twins who were separated by doctors in Australia last week still want to be close to each other nurses have told reporters.15-month-old sisters Dawa and Nima Pelden flew nearly 6000 miles for the life-changing operation. They were born joined at the stomach.Nurse coordinator Kellie Smith who works on the twins' ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital told reporters Thursday that the pair are never far from one another."We try and have them a little bit apart" Smith said according to CNN affiliate Channel 7. "But they manage to sort of bum shuffle back together and have their legs intertwined always."The nurse added that ward staff initially tried putting the twins in separate beds but "they didn't like that at all.""They're in the one bed together and just happy playing with one another and it's actually beautiful to see" Smith added."They like their mother close too. They're always looking for mum and she's never far away."Girls have followed 'the path that we set out for them'Lead pediatric surgeon Joe Crameri said the girls were doing well six days after the operation."The girls have followed largely the path that we set out for them" he said CNN affiliate Channel 7 reported. "Like any surgical pathway there has been a few bumps in the road and there are a few bumps we're still smoothing out -- but with all the resources we've got here at the Children's Hospital ... we're making good progress at the current time."Crameri added that the sisters were "getting back to a more normal life.""They're back to eating and they're starting to move around and the areas that we've repaired on their tummy wall seems to be holding up with the strain quite nicely."The delicate procedure carried out November 9 took more than six hours and involved about 25 surgeons nurses and anesthetists according to CNN affiliate 9 News.The twins were born via cesarean section last year and are believed to be Bhutan's first conjoined twins. As well as issues with mobility and comfort the twins had recently been losing weight which was a concern to doctors Elizabeth Lodge CEO of Melbourne-based nonprofit Children First Foundation which funded the operation said last month.The girls' operation was estimated to cost about $180000 (250000 Australian dollars) according to 9 News.'Delightful to look after'Nurse coordinator Smith said Nima and Dawa have been a delight to look after and that their personalities were shining through.Megan Collins another nurse on the ward agreed that the pair were in good spirits."They're loving interacting with the nursing staff" Collins said."We're now blowing bubbles and doing high fives they love it when we're watching the Wiggles -- they'll do little dance moves with their hands and what-not" Channel 7 reported Collins as saying during a press conference."It's really nice to see them separated. But they're still really happy about wanting to be close to one another."Difficult surgeryConjoined twins occur once every 200000 live births according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. About 70% are female and they are always identical twins.Scientists believe that conjoined twins develop from a single fertilized egg that fails to separate completely as it divides."The success of surgery depends on where the twins are joined and how many and which organs are shared as well as the experience and skill of the surgical team" according to the Mayo Clinic.They were previously commonly referred to as "Siamese twins" a name that originated with Eng and Chang Bunker conjoined twins who were born in Siam (now Thailand) in 1811. Never separated they lived to the age of 63 and appeared in traveling exhibitions. Chang and Eng both married and fathered a total of 21 children between them.While surgery to separate twins joined at the abdomen and other parts of their bodies can face complications twins joined at the head are at a far greater risk.The case of two American boys joined at the top of their skulls attracted global attention in 2016 when doctors successfully separated them after 27 hours of surgery.,Health
 (CNN)When Meghann Adams learned that she was pregnant in early 2015 she was ecstatic. Starting a family with her husband Chris had not been easy but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.The entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom Jamie McNeil made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them. "It was the best feeling ever" Adams 35 told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.Twenty weeks into her pregnancy Adams had an anatomy scan a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in the tone changed.Although Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys. The Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney which is believed to affect one in 3500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and as a result can't function. In most cases children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases a kidney transplant might be necessary.McNeil the twins' grandmother wanted to be a donor but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney."It was just really overwhelming and devastating" Adams said. "We were on pins and needles for a while just really unsure."The long wait for a healthy kidneyDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. "I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born" Adam said. Those initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding. Delly was prodded and poked her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up.  At just 6 days old she began to experience renal failure."I just didn't know how to react or what to do" Adams said "and my mind was going in a million different directions."Doctors began talking about dialysis and transplants but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery. Slowly Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month and every day her blood was tested. At 3 months Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.Her nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately but maybe not so far into Delly's future.'A gift certificate for an organ'For those in need of a kidney transplant the wait is long. Of the nearly 100000 people waiting for a kidney last year only about 20% were able to find a match according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years. Delly's next big test will be puberty when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney Adams and her mother McNeil began researching options to prepare.McNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney. And that's how they came across an innovative new program the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.  Essentially it's "a gift certificate for an organ" Adams said. Donors 'waiting for their recipient' The program began at the University of California Los Angeles four years ago when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future. Like Delly Broadman's grandson Quinn then 4 was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.Veale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors. Veale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients. Transplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.  Veale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney. "The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible" Veale said. "These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one who doesn't quite need a kidney yet."Adding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor."It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible" Turgeon said.The vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for and it expires when the voucher holder dies. The first three "voucher donations" triggered 25 transplants. For Delly and her grandmother the voucher program was the answer. 'A dream come true'McNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor. She's never been called to donate though and always wondered about other ways to help."My soul needs a connection with humanity" she said.There were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare long-term impacts can include pain nerve damage hernia or intestinal obstruction.None of that dissuaded McNeil. "I'm a nurse so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it that I just know it's the right thing to do" she said before the surgery. "My soul is at peace with whatever might happen."In September McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day with organs criss-crossing the country."It's like a dream come true to me" McNeil said. For McNeil her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her. "I wish to see more love and so I'm going to be that love" she told Gupta. "If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me."McNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life. "When I'm on my deathbed" she said "the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day."'We're more similar than different' McNeil returned home just a day after her surgery and though she was sore she was in the best of spirits.  Her kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.The news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient. "These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different often matching patients of different ethnicities religions genders sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future" Veale said. "We need a little more kindness in the world and this is what these voucher donations do." Delly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person like her. And to Delly that doesn't mean much. At 2½ she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen read books and giggle with her grandma.,Health
Moseley Virginia (CNN)Parents of children who had a horrifying polio-like illness are accusing the Centers for Disease Control of hiding the deaths of two children who suffered from the condition.The parents say by not publicly acknowledging the two deaths the agency is intentionally downplaying the severity of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) a disease that paralyzes healthy children in a matter of hours. "I feel like they're just sugar-coating this" said Katie Bustamante whose son Alex age 6 died in May. "It eliminates my trust in the CDC."Their accusations come amid a wave of criticism from parents of children with AFM and from some of the CDC's own medical advisers. In a recent on-camera interview with CNN a group of parents gave the agency an "F" for its handling of the outbreak.A CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases there may be a "lag" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC."I think we want to catch up with the backlog" said Dr. Anne Schuchat principal deputy director of the CDC a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. "Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program."Schuchat who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu SARS and anthrax said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something."I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible" Schuchat said. "We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is."She added that there's no simple lab test for AFM so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.Twenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM and 11 additional states have possible cases according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness and 162 cases are currently under investigation according to the most recent CDC data.On its AFM surveillance webpage the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month Dr. Nancy Messonnier director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017 but did not mention any deaths this year even when asked about it by a reporter.Chris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son Carter in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.The CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments which in turn report the cases to the CDC. Two pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths. "It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases" said Dr. Keith Van Haren assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC." Carter's parents agree. "They're doing a s*** job of measuring this excuse my French" said his mother Robin a healthcare IT specialist.'Mommy mommy help me'On July 29 2016 Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.It's just a virus thought his parents who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.The next morning Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor."Mommy mommy help me" his mother remembers him saying.Robin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.Within a few days Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.For the next two years his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.Carter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.Carter went to pre-school and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.A few weeks later on September 22 he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: "Mommy I'm fine."Today Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room. A doctor wants answersBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016. Alex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health but she doesn't know what happened after that. In Carter's case his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions sent the paperwork lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.An epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC according to Rao assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.Doctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths they haven't received responses. Rao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team but never heard back."I would like answers" said Rao an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.His voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter whom he cared for for more than two years. "I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM" he said.Other experts agree with Rao. "We want accurate numbers" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.An accurate count could help answer questions he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? "That helps us understand causation" he said."The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences] and a death is really important" added Van Haren the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC. Schuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. "We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously" she said.She said the agency has established a case definition for AFM done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.  A CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as "disease detectives" -- to  help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.An enterprising parentOn June 10 2017 about ten months after Carter got sick Robin reached out to the CDC.She was angry."I know it may seem menial a request from a clinically educated mother but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website."Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data" she continued. "Or god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight."She received a response two days later."We are sorry to hear about your son" it said. "Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions."She never heard from the CDC again.CNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC."I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning" Schuchat told CNN.  "We are trying to better connect with families and it's so important that we listen to them."Several other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.Messonnier the CDC doctor told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.Last week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon Virginia was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father Jeremy works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.He aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.He thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the "F" that parents gave the CDC.That was a pivotal moment" he said of the CNN story.More than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.Carter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them.CNN's John Bonifield and Michael Nedelman contributed to this story. ,Health
 (CNN)There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis a polio-like illness that mostly affects children the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.There are also 162 possible cases under investigation 23 more than last week.AFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system especially the gray matter in the spinal cord and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4 although adults can also develop AFM.The agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.The CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report "Clinical laboratory and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association." However Dr. Nancy Messonnier director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said Tuesday that the agency is "not ruling anything out." In the past two weeks the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins. Many of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM. Enteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long they're most common in the summer and fall which is also when AFM peaks. Typically enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever runny nose and body aches and recovery is easy.Some of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus but others have not although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus. It's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms but only one may become paralyzed. Two weeks ago four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes. The experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes which they said were highly unlikely and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.  "I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this" Dr. Keith Van Haren an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine said of the CDC's new report. "It's great." Van Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it. Dr. Kenneth Tyler a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM agreed. "I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction" he said. Both neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks. Jeremy Wilcox a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September also praised the agency for becoming more open. Parents of children with AFM say that for years their emails to the CDC went unanswered. Last week Wilcox arranged a meeting between Dr. Anne Schuchat the agency's principal deputy director and more than a dozen parents of children with AFM. That meeting is taking place on Tuesday. ,Health
 (CNN)With the news from the US Food and Drug Administration that vaping is skyrocketing among American youth parents might be wondering how concerned they should be and what they should do if they catch their child using an e-cigarette.The new numbers are staggering: Vaping increased nearly 80% among high schoolers and 50% among middle schoolers since last year. Health experts say behavior changes are keys to look for as more and more children and young adults become addicted to nicotine causing physiological changes to their brain. "It's just this huge epidemic" said Marcella Bianco the program director for CATCH My Breath which works to prevent the spread of e-cigarette use.Steven Kelder a professor of epidemiology with the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston  who also serves as a lead investigator for CATCH said every parent needs to be aware of the dangers of vaping."Kids have a hard time quitting or even wanting to quit thus causing family disturbances" he said. "Nicotine interferes with parental relationships and pushes children towards delinquent behavior.  Raising a teen is hard enough without nicotine addiction."Here are important takeaways for parents raising teens.What is vaping? E-cigarettes or vaping work by heating a liquid containing nicotine until it vaporizes. Experts say the huge increase in teen use is the result of a single company Juul which they say grabbed up market share with an assortment of flavors high nicotine content and devices that look like USB drives. Juul gives users a flavored nicotine fix without the smell and smoke of combustible cigarettes. "I think parents should be proactive and talk to their kids about vaping" Kelder said.Kelder said most of the flavors marketed by Juul contain 5% nicotine -- "a very high dose of nicotine." Juul vowed this week to halt most retail sales of flavor products while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website. The company also announced that it was shutting down some of its social media accounts. Juul has said that it designed its products for adult smokers trying to switch from combustible cigarettes. Ashley Gould the chief administrative officer for Juul Labs previously told CNN its popularity among youth has been "devastating to us.""This is not a product for youth. It's a product for adult smokers" Gould said.If you catch your child vaping Kelder said you'll need to wean them off slowly bringing them down to a vape with 3% nicotine."If their child has been using 5% [nicotine] for any length of time they are probably addicted and will be resistant to quitting. The withdrawals at that high level will be too strong" he said. "Normalizing their blood nicotine content to a lower dose is a big first step towards quitting.  Once at 3% then quitting altogether will be much easier."How do I know if my child is vaping?Teens are very good at hiding vaping from parents coaches and school administrators experts say. Bianco said parents need to check to make sure USB drives really are USB drives. Many times they're actually Juuls with kids taking them to school and using them in bathrooms and locker rooms."Parents need to take a look at what's being charged: Is it a USB drive or not?" she said. "Unfortunately that's where we are [as a society]."Other signs to look out for: Has your child been asking for more money than usual? Does he or she have dry mouth and/or nosebleeds?"Nearly all teens vape fruit or candy flavors" Kelder added. "You may notice a sweet scent on your child." What are the health effects of vaping?Nicotine changes the brain interfering with development up to the age of 26. So experts say the skyrocketing use of vaping among America's youth should be concerning not to just parents but to public health officials across the country. The outcome of nicotine addiction Kelder said is "mild reductions in cognitive function in the prefrontal cortex leading to poor decision-making reduced impulse control increased mood disorders such as anxiety and depression."Pregnant women could also unknowingly harm their fetuses by vaping because "nicotine is neurotoxic to a developing fetus.""Sudden infant death syndrome SIDS is a real worry" Kelder added.Bianco said parents frequently complain of behavior problems with their children who vape. "They're having a hard time sleeping" she said "because they're doing Juul so much in schools and throughout the day."We know what nicotine does and 99% of the e-cigarettes have nicotine. We know how nicotine changes the brain especially for developing youth" Bianco said.Another key point: the many unknowns from chemicals like glycerin and propylene glycol in some vapes. "That's the scary part" she said. "We don't know the long-term health effects these kids are going to have in future years."How did this happen?Juul's rapid rise in the past year shocked public health officials Bianco said. It's easy to buy online she said resulting in astronomical sales and skyrocketing use among youth."It took us all by surprise" Bianco said. "I wish we knew ahead of time that this was coming aboard. We have a huge epidemic on our hands."Kelder said simply "Juul delivers the highest level of nicotine available. I believe that is the reason why the rates are rising so quickly.  The addiction potential with Juul is much higher than with previous e-cig versions."CNN's Roni Selig contributed to this report.,Health
Beijing (CNN)Chinese authorities have announced strict new measures in an attempt to halt the country's fast-growing African swine fever crisis which has spread to 18 provinces and led to the culling of more than 200000 pigs.Days after acknowledging the situation was "serious" the Chinese Agricultural Ministry on Friday reported the first outbreak of the disease in the southwestern province of Sichuan in a farm of 40 pigs.The news is especially concerning for officials as Sichuan is the top swine-producing region in China -- a country that produces half of the world's pigs with a current population of around 500 million swine.Although the disease poses no direct danger to human health its arrival and spread in China have increasingly threatened the pork industry with major potential impact on supplies and prices in coming months.In a rare document jointly issued Wednesday by the Ministries of Agriculture Transportation and Public Security the government blamed unhygienic vehicles transporting pigs and profit-driven "lawless elements" moving animals out of high-risk areas for the disease's rapid spread since the first case emerged in August.The directive called for stricter nationwide inspections of all livestock transportation vehicles and harsher punishments for the illegal transportation and slaughter of pigs.The document comes after the United Nations recently warned that the disease is "here to stay" in China and could quickly turn into an epidemic with the most virulent strain of swine fever causing a 100% fatality rate for infected pigs."What we're seeing so far is just the tip of the iceberg" Juan Lubroth the chief veterinary officer at UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said in September."Transboundary emergence of the virus likely through movements of products containing infected pork will almost certainly occur" he added. "So it's no longer 'if' that will happen but when and what we can do collaboratively to prevent and minimize the damage."African swine fever which has no vaccine or cure was first detected in Asia last year in an area in Siberia according to the UN. Chinese authorities in October banned the feeding of kitchen waste or swill to pigs after linking the widely used practice to most early cases of the disease. They also announced plans to set up a registration system for vehicles transporting livestock.Despite the UN's recognition of China's efforts to contain the disease some experts remain skeptical of Beijing's ability to get it under control pointing to the challenges of enforcing biosecurity on the country's vast number of backyard pig farms.,Health
Dr. Agnes Binagwaho is the vice chancellor of the University of Global Health Equity. Trained as a pediatrician she worked for over 20 years in Rwanda's public sector and was the country's minister of health for five years. (CNN)President Xi Jinping recently described myopia as an epidemic  affecting China's younger generations. There are now an estimated 720 million Chinese citizens with uncorrected poor vision according to Dr. Xun Xu at the Shanghai Eye Hospital. Short-sightedness increases dramatically with age; it affects over half of children aged 10 80% of 16-year-olds and over 90% of university students in China.But the Chinese government has the resolve -- and a five-year plan -- to eradicate poor vision and preventable blindness by delivering "universal medical eye care for all." It is a huge undertaking but worth doing as treating myopia is more than just a health issue. Myopia costs the global economy around $3 trillion a year in health costs and lost productivity according to a 2010 report. By 2050 nearly 50% of the world's population is predicted to have myopia according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.  Vision is the golden thread by which many of the UN's sustainable development goals can be achieved including quality education decent work and economic growth and gender equality.China should draw on the experiences of countries that have set an example on the issue.   Learning from RwandaIn Rwanda during my tenure as minister for health and thereafter we executed a plan that has provided all 12 million citizens with the option of accessing glasses. The glasses cost as little as $1.50 and are provided free for the poorest 20%.Rwanda's history sets a precedent for such policy not only in its ambition but also in its feasibility. The key strategy was training nurses at regular health centers to deliver sight tests and prescribe glasses. In Rwanda between 2012 and 2017 a three-day course trained about 2800 nurses to perform eye exams nationwide and provide appropriate eye care meeting a critical shortage of trained specialists to diagnose eye conditions.  Restrictions that had previously prevented other health workers from carrying out vision tests were removed so testing was not merely confined to ophthalmologists.These professionals working in Rwanda's health centers have now distributed over 150000 affordable glasses to those in need.  Between October 2016 and February 2018 about 103500 of those who had their vision tested by nurses were referred to a hospital to receive custom glasses have surgery or simply be given eye drops. Of those about 34500 were up to 14 years old and 92150 were 15 and above. Rural problemsAs in China consistency of health care between rural and urban parts of Rwanda was an issue. To address this the government set up 502 health centers with good access to all 15000 villages across Rwanda. In each health center four general nurses were upskilled to provide basic vision testing and eye care alongside their other duties. China faces a significant discrepancy between eye care in the urban areas where most ophthalmologists practice and the rural regions where approximately 42% of the population lives; people there often live 50 miles or farther from the nearest town or city. Like Rwanda China can also expand the types of providers who can deliver these screening programs in the countryside.  In nine out of 10 cases all it takes to treat poor vision is a simple pair of glasses. According to Euromonitor China is the largest manufacturer of eye glasses in the world and so is well positioned to make those gains; unlike Rwanda it wouldn't need to import.   There could be economic benefits in doing so.Tea farmers in a plantation in Assam India became 20% more productive when they wore a simple pair of reading glasses according to a recent study by Clearly an organization trying to tackle uncorrected poor vision across the world which was published in the journal Lancet Global Health.And for those employees over the age of 50 their output increased by no less than 31% -- a larger productivity increase than has been recorded by any other health intervention known featured in peer-reviewed research.Video gaming to blame?Xi's recent focus on the myopia issue has caused some to suggest that children's obsession with video games which keeps them indoors is to blame.  Although there is mixed evidence for whether near work itself leads to myopia one factor in the development of myopia is the amount of time spent outdoors in the sunlight.While all potential causes of myopia should be examined and prevention is important the challenge for China at this juncture is to get eye testing and affordable glasses to all those who need them.The potential for China -- one of the fastest-growing and most technologically advanced economies in the world -- is immense.The country's commitment to this eye care revolution will translate into benefits well beyond the health sector and will help to promote literacy education the economic empowerment of families and the country as a whole.  As we implement and sustain these programs Rwanda should continue to share its experience and learnings with China. ,Health
 (CNN)The best way to maintain weight loss may be to change your diet to one low in carbohydrates according to new research. The study published Wednesday in the journal BMJ involved 164 overweight or obese people. Their weight was brought down by 12% and they were stabilized at that weight and put on a high- medium- or low-carbohydrate diet for 20 weeks. The diets were made up of 20% carbs and protein and 60% fat 40% carbs and fat and 20% protein or 60% carbs and 20% protein and fat. "We found that the type of diet people ate had a major impact on their metabolism. Those on the low-carbohydrate diet burned about 250 calories a day more than those on the high-carbohydrate diet even though all the groups were the same weight" said Dr. David Ludwig principal investigator of the study and co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital. While participants were on these diets their calorie intake was controlled so that they maintained the baseline weight. If a participant started to lose or gain weight their calorie intake was increased or decreased. "If somebody's metabolism speeded up they would have started losing weight and that would have triggered us to increase calories just to restore weight to that baseline target" said Ludwig who is also a professor of pediatrics and nutrition at Harvard University. The research looked at diet's effect directly on the metabolism he said which is one of the things that works against you when you are trying to maintain weight. "These findings show that all calories are not alike to the body from a metabolic perspective and that restricting carbohydrates may be a better strategy than restricting calories for long-term success" Ludwig said. He also believes that without the calorie control intervention having a low-carb diet could create spontaneous weight loss of about 20 pounds over a few years. "This seems like an important finding BUT I would be highly cautious as the interpretation of the results seems quite incorrect" said Naveed Sattar professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow in a written statement. Sattar who was not involved with the study said that the low-carbohydrate group seems to have been eating more calories than the other groups to have kept similar weights."This brings the other point that what really matters is weight change and we already know from much larger and longer trials that weight loss is broadly similar whatever diet one takes (low carb or low fat or others) as long as one sticks to the diet" he said.   "So in short I don't believe this work changes anything and nor does it convince me that low carb diets are meaningfully better to relevant health outcomes. The overwhelming evidence does not support this." Experts also pointed out that all the participants had the same basic metabolic rate so other unmeasured activities could explain differences as well as high levels of saturated fat in the low-carbohydrate diet which could lead to increased cholesterol and heart disease risk.Kevin McConway emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University noted that "because the different diets had to be made up from foods that may have differed in other ways than just their carbohydrate and fat content it remains possible that these other differences were responsible for some part of the observed differences in energy expenditures." ,Health
 (CNN)There have been 80 confirmed cases of the polio-like illness known as AFM in 25 states this year as of Friday the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday. In addition there are 139 cases under investigation for a total of 219 confirmed and suspected.This is eight more confirmed cases than the agency reported last week and 20 additional patients under investigation. The CDC noted an increase in reports of patients under investigation who began experiencing symptoms in August September and October. It has not identified the 25 states with confirmed illnesses nor has it said how many states are reporting cases under investigation. AFM or acute flaccid myelitis is a rare illness that affects the nervous system especially the gray matter in the spinal cord and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month the CDC said that 90% of patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4 although adults can also develop AFM. Other symptoms include drooping of the face or eyelids difficult eye movement trouble swallowing or slurred speech. Research is underway to determine the cause of AFM although there is a focus on enteroviruses which can cause respiratory illness and West Nile virus and other viruses in that family. According to the CDC there have been 404 confirmed cases in the United States since August 2014. The number of cases may be higher but the condition is not subject to mandatory reporting so not all cases are reported to state health departments and therefore may not be counted by the CDC. "Even with an increase in cases since 2014 AFM remains a very rare condition. Less than one in a million people in the United States get AFM each year" the CDC says. AFM peaks every other year seasonally in late summer and fall. but experts have yet to identify a single factor geographically or otherwise to explain the cause. Also unknown: why some patients recover and others have prolonged effects. This story has been updated to clarify the total number of AFM cases how many are under investigation and how many are confirmed,Health
London (CNN)Coca-Cola has slimmed down its Christmas truck tour through Britain amid opposition from health campaigners.The annual tour in which cans of Coke are handed out in dozens of towns and cities started in 1995. The events would be hosted by local councils and "other landowners as part of their Christmas festivities" according to a statement from food and health charity Sustain. This year's tour kicked off in Glasgow on November 9 and according to Sustain will visit 24 municipalities -- down from 38 in 2017. This follows local opposition coordinated by Sustain's Sugar Smart campaign including protests in a handful of cities against the festive marketing campaign. Sustain said in a statement that cities like Carlisle and Liverpool have chosen not to invite the truck back onto public land this year and noted that Public Health England issued guidance to local councils warning against "the impact seasonal marketing promotions can have on diet-related diseases." Nearly 100 organizations and campaigners have signed a letter calling on the soft-drink giant to hand out only sugar-free drinks. Sustain added that this year the truck is visiting areas that have worse than average health problems relating to diet: "14 of the 19 stops in England have above average prevalence of excess weight amongst 10-11 years olds."Activists are also pushing large supermarket chains like Asda and Tesco to stop hosting the truck.Coca-Cola defended its use of Christmas trucks saying that 90% of the drinks sampled this year will have zero sugar. "For a few weeks per year thousands of consumers love and enjoy our Christmas truck tour and as long as consumers want it we will continue to run it" Jon Woods general manager of Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland wrote in a statement.,Health
 (CNN)It sounds simple enough: juice a bunch of celery drink it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and wait for the health benefits to roll in. A search for #CeleryJuice on Instagram returns over 35000 posts not including all the variations on the hashtag. Some social media users say that drinking celery juice has cured them of mental health problems and infertility. Others credit it with healing eczema that nothing else could cure. One website even claims that it can prevent cancer. Stories touting its "potent healing properties" have appeared on Gwyneth Paltrow's controversial lifestyle site Goop. But are these health benefits real?"It's not a surprise to me that anything a celebrity or an influencer with lots of followers would mention would get a lot of attention" Lisa Drayer a registered dietitian who writes about nutrition for CNN said of the celery juice trend. Celery certainly has health benefits according to Drayer. "There are some beneficial flavonoids that have been discovered in celery that have been shown to perhaps play a role in reducing inflammation in the brain or reducing age-related memory decline" she said. Celery also provides a healthy dose of fiber as well as vitamins C and K and potassium and it is a very low-calorie snack."A 5-inch stalk has only three calories so that's very low-calorie. A cup of chopped celery has only 20 calories" she said. But turning it into juice can change this. "Any time you concentrate a vegetable or a fruit it's going to be higher in sugars and carbohydrates and calories" Drayer said. A cup of juiced celery jumps to 42 calories. "I'm much more likely to recommend celery as a snack. It's crunchy it's low-calorie and it will fill you up" Drayer said. In fact she often advises it this for people who are trying to lose weight. Research around the benefits of celery and celery juice is limited she noted and we "really can't say there's anything magical about celery that's going to help cure cancer or help you to quickly shed pounds." Juicing celery has other drawbacks beyond raising the calorie count. "Juicing celery (and any other vegetable) strips away the beneficial fiber that helps you feel fuller longer improves intestinal health and feeds the health bacteria in your gut" Malina Malkani registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics wrote in an email. Although she agrees that there are several health benefits to eating celery she also agrees that there is little evidence to back up the claims made by some supporters of the juice trend. "There isn't much scientific evidence to support the majority of health claims about drinking celery juice" she said. "In general if a food fad diet or service sounds too good to be true you can assume that it is."There's something else about celery juice that could explain its popularity on social media: "The beautiful green color of celery juice also lends itself to gorgeous photos in an Instagram feed" said Malkani who is also creator of the Wholitarian Lifestyle which promotes foods that "are nutrient-dense minimally processed plant-based and as close as possible to their original state when first harvested." However she pointed out that this doesn't mean there is evidence behind the health claims. Neither Drayer nor Malkani thinks that drinking celery juice is problematic but they stress that it is probably not a miracle cure."If you enjoy the flavor of celery juice have at it!" Malkani said. "But don't jump on the Instagram bandwagon hoping that celery juice will be the cure-all you've been searching for all your life." Both suggest that celery should be eaten as part of a balanced and inclusive diet and that everyone should be wary of celebrity-endorsed food trends."In general just because a celebrity is touting a food or a beverage for particular reasons doesn't mean it's backed by sound science even beyond celery juice" Drayer said. "What I always tell people is that there's no one magical food or beverage that will be able to totally make over your health or cure an illness." ,Health
 (CNN)The CEO of e-cigarette maker Juul announced plans Tuesday to eliminate some of its social media accounts and halt most retail sales of flavor products as part of a plan to restrict access to minors. The plan came in response to the US Food and Drug Administration's September announcement that it would investigate major e-cigarette makers and review their sales and marketing practices. "Our intent was never to have youth use JUUL" Kevin Burns wrote in the Tuesday statement that outlined an action plan divided into four key areas: flavors retail stores social media and the future. Burns said the company will be "eliminating our own social media accounts and continuing to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party accounts."  More than 99% of all social media content related to the company is generated through third-party users and accounts "with no affiliation to our company" Burns wrote. "To remove ourselves entirely from participation in the social conversation we have decided to shut down our U.S.-based social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram" he wrote. "Our presence on Twitter will be confined to non-promotional communications only." YouTube posts will consist only of testimonials by former adult smokers who have switched to the Juul system Burns said.Stopping retail sale of most Juul flavorsAdditionally the company vowed to stop selling most flavored Juul pods to all 90000-plus retail stores including convenience stores and vape shops while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website. Juul will also continue enforcement against unauthorized sales in other online marketplaces.Going forward Burns said the company will develop technology to ensure that retailers comply with age requirements and restrict access to its products.The company is "committed to improving the lives of the world's one billion adult smokers with the ultimate goal of eliminating cigarettes" Burns said. "We don't want anyone who doesn't smoke or already use nicotine to use JUUL products. We certainly don't want youth using the product."In a move to reduce teen e-cigarette use FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as this week. The agency will impose age-verification requirements for online sales. Flavored e-cigarette products would be available in vape and tobacco shops.In the September statement  Gottlieb said smoking "remains the number one preventable cause of death in America killing nearly half a million people a year."  He added that the agency's observation is that "youth use of e-cigs is rising very sharply."  'What's the counter-move?'Jon-Patrick Allem a research scientist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California said that Juul's removal of its Instagram and Facebook accounts is "a good first step."Yet he noted that the company is going to keep its Twitter account. "In my research I've demonstrated that Juul is discussed quite often on Twitter" he said and among those doing so are teens and young adults. "They create little communities to discuss which products or flavors they like and when and where they are using Juul" he said. The consequences of these online discussions include awareness of use of and misperceptions about the product.  Interventions may be needed to deter interest among young people and to correct these misperceptions he said. For example he said "all Juul products have nicotine; many adolescents are unaware of that. Many young adults -- about 40% of college-aged students 18 to 24 -- were unaware that all Juul products have nicotine in them. This is part of the landscape that influences product uptake." Allem believes that removing most flavored Juul products from retail stores which will reduce and limit accessibility is another good move. The next question is "something along the lines of: What's the counter-move? How will youth circumvent these new restrictions?" he said.  Though it's "great to initiate restrictions" the company needs to see how young people respond and then update the restrictions.Allem's research also shows that one of the more appealing characteristics of the sleek small Juul device is its ability to be used in places where smoking and vaping are restricted.  Research shows that Juul is used "all the way down to elementary schools" he said. Many teachers wouldn't be able to identify a Juul product so "raising awareness" among educators "in school systems from elementary up to high school and into college is also an important step" to deter teen use.'The minimum first steps'Kar-Hai Chu assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research on Media Technology and Health considers Juul's action plan "the minimum first steps needed.""Unfortunately while their social media action plan was a necessary response it is like trying to put the genie back in the bottle" Chu wrote in an email. "Unlike traditional media platforms social media messages are not spread from a single source but exponentially through each person's entire social network. The youth that JUUL's messages have already reached whether on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram will be the ones that are doing JUUL's marketing."Chu explained that "nicotine impacts brain development during adolescence. Research has also repeatedly found that adolescent use of e-cigarettes increases the risk of using traditional cigarettes." For these reasons he remains concerned about e-cigarette use among teens.In his statement in September Gottlieb said the FDA will "continue to work to find out why so many kids are using and abusing these products." Juul's Burns said he believes his company and the FDA have a common goal: "We want to be the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine."CNN's Jamie Gumbrecht Roni Selig and Davide Cannaviccio  contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)An important transition is happening across the United States: Cancer was the leading cause of death in more counties in 2015 than 13 years earlier a new study finds. However the opposite was true for heart disease during that period; fewer counties reported it as the top killer.In fact cancer will replace heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States within two years according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projections referenced in the study published Monday in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine."We're just on the cusp of the transition from heart disease to cancer as the leading cause of death" said Dr. Latha Palaniappan lead author of the study and an internist professor and clinical researcher at Stanford University Medical Center. Shifts in socioeconomic ethnic groupsA decades-old theory described a shift that occurred in health and disease patterns in the United States during the last century. Early in the 100-year period infectious diseases including tuberculosis diphtheria and flu took more American lives than other illnesses. Yet by the end of the century chronic diseases including heart disease and cancer had become the leading cause of death. The theory described these complex patterns and suggested that such shifts stemmed from economic and social conditions.Recent data suggests that the nation is experiencing a new transition this time within the chronic disease category itself.  To understand these changes Stanford Medical School researchers examined more than 32 million death records across 3143 American counties for 2003 through 2015. The research team looked not only at medical information but at demographic data including income and race.Over the 13-year study period the mortality rate decreased in the total population by 12% from about 823 deaths per every 100000 people to roughly 724 deaths per 100000.In more than three-quarters of all counties (79%) heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2003 yet this remained true for only 59% of counties in 2015. By contrast cancer caused the most deaths in about two of every 10 counties during 2003 with the same true for four of every 10 counties in 2015. While the overall heart disease mortality rate decreased by 28% high-income counties experienced a 30% drop versus a 22% fall in low-income counties. The cancer mortality rate also dropped though less dramatically: It declined by 16% with an 18% drop seen in high-income counties versus 11% in low-income.According to the researchers lower-income areas may see a slower shift in the cause of death due to socioeconomic geographic demographic and other factors that influence health and death. The researchers also compared shifts in patterns for racial and ethnic groups. Here they found that among Asian-Americans Hispanics and whites cancer replaced heart disease as the leading cause of death.  However a similar pattern was not seen among American Indians/Alaska Natives or blacks. Economic factors also affect the new pattern of mortality rates across the nation. Heart disease surpassed other causes of death in the lowest-income counties for all racial and ethnic groups during 2015 the researchers found yet only Asian-Americans Hispanics and whites in the highest-income counties saw cancer outpace heart disease as the leading cause of death in 2015. Making improvements in cancer care available to all The research "provides another lens" for interpreting dynamics related to the transition in mortality patterns wrote Silvia Stringhini a researcher at Switzerland's Lausanne University Hospital and Dr. Idris Guessous a practicing physician and epidemiologist at Switzerland's Geneva University Hospitals in an editorial published with the study."The driving force behind the transition from the age of 'pestilence and famine' to the age of 'manmade diseases' is improvement in socioeconomic conditions such as standards of living health habits hygiene and nutrition" Stringhini and Guessous wrote.How genetic testing screening and personalized medicine affect cancer rates is still unclear they noted. New and expensive cancer therapies are being introduced yet they might contribute to "increasing social inequalities in cancer survival with better-off persons experiencing more rapid decreases in mortality" they added. And the same may be true of genetic testing and cancer screening they noted.It's likely that any differences in mortality trends could be explained by differences in smoking obesity and diabetes trends among high and low income groups the authors stated. "For example between 1960 and 2015 the prevalence of smoking in the United States decreased from 39% to 6% among college graduates but from 46% to 23% among persons who did not complete high school" they wrote. With cancer about to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death what do most Americans need to know? "Undergo all of the recommended cancer screenings" Palaniappan advised and adopt "lifestyle prevention practices such as healthy diet and exercise which are beneficial in lowering both cancer and heart disease mortality.""The investments in research in both heart disease and cancer have paid off over the last decades because both heart disease and cancer rates are going down" she said. "Without all of the wonderful new therapies that we have now this would not have happened."Still there's more work to be done she said: "We need to work harder in lower income areas of the US so they can see the same improvements in mortality. We need to focus more on heart disease and cancer prevention and treatment efforts in African-American populations particularly.",Health
 (CNN)The United States has more than double the rate of premature overdose deaths of at least 12 other countries according to a new study.The research published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine says that there were an estimated 63632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 in the US. "The U.S. has the highest death rate due to drug overdoses for both men and women (35 deaths in 100000 men and 20 deaths in 100000 women) in 2015 more than double those of any other country in our study" Yingxi Chen one of the researchers and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute wrote in an email. Mexico had the lowest rates: 1 death per 100000 men and 0.2 deaths per 100000 women. The researchers also found that the United States had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths: 4.3% per year in men and 5.3% per year in women Chen said. Only Estonia had a higher increase. Norway was found to have the biggest decrease in drug overdose mortality for the whole population. Decreases were also found among men and women in Mexico Spanish men and Danish women. Researchers "looked at the trends and patterns of drug overdose deaths among people age 20 to 64 years in 13 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development between 2001-2015" Chen said. These countries were Australia Chile Denmark England Wales (the data for these two countries was combined) Estonia Finland Germany Mexico the Netherlands Norway Spain and the United States. "I think it reinforces what we know about the United States but also points out some of the contrast in terms of the ways other countries have dealt with similar issues" said Caleb Banta-Green principal research scientist at the University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute who was not involved in the research. Banta-Green and the researchers both point out that opioids play a part in the high levels of drug overdose deaths in the US. The study describes US opioid deaths as "triple epidemic waves" starting with prescription opioid deaths in the late 1990s heroin deaths beginning in 2010 and finally deaths due to synthetic opioids which include fentanyl. Other countries have found solutions to high rates of opioid-related deaths according to Banta-Green who cited France which was not included in the research. "When France got rid of the restrictions on prescribers using the medication buprenorphine their national mortality opiate overdose mortality rate dropped 79%" he said. Buprenorphine is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that can be used alongside behavioral therapies and counseling to help with the treatment of opioid addiction. It is the "first medication to treat opioid dependency that is permitted to be prescribed or dispensed in physician offices significantly increasing treatment access" according to the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Banta-Green believes that creating better access to substance abuse disorder treatments along with a better national understanding that these are treatable medical conditions would help reduce the number of overdose-related deaths in the US. This includes giving more people access to medications that could help treat and manage opiate addiction. "That's really fundamentally what I think we need to take away from these data finding is that there are solutions other countries have them and we are not doing the dramatic things that we need to be doing" he said. ,Health

It's an attractive theory that finds its evidence in a community on the island of Okinawa that's nicknamed the Village of Longevity because its residents have the highest life expectancy in the world. They also largely share a devotion to a Japanese philosophy known as ikigai over-simply translated as the happiness derived from being busy at some activity that holds meaning and purpose for them.Ogimi the friendly village of 3000 of the world's longest-living people is known for its slow pace ocean views community gatherings personal vegetable gardens and residents who smile laugh and joke incessantly. They also take great pride in living to 100 and beyond. They have fewer chronic illnesses than most people including cancer and heart disease and their rate of dementia is well below the global average. The question then is how? Books have been written to explain the phenomenon including Dan Buettner's bestselling "The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest" and volumes just on ikigai such as Héctor García and Francesc Miralles' compact "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life."The answer is probably a combination of factors that include the usual suspects: diet movement/exercise and having friends and community. What these "blue zone" areas of longevity and happiness around the world have in common are residents who curate a simple life with few possessions plenty of time outdoors staying active with friends getting enough sleep and eating lightly and healthily.What the long-lived Japanese add to this list is ikigai a concept that is at times used synonymously with purpose passion meaning mission vocation and drive. If you brew all those notions together and distill its contents you get ikigai. Finding your ikigaiIkigai has been drawn in books and articles as the center of a Venn diagram in which your answers to these questions all overlap: What do you love? What are you good at? What can you be paid for? What does the world need? When you find the answer that fits all four questions that's your ikigai.Another way of defining your own ikigai is to simply ask yourself: Why do you get up in the morning? Or what motivates you? Or as Viktor Frankl put it "Why do you not commit suicide?" Frankl a psychiatrist and neurologist is the creator of a type of therapy infused with spiritual themes known as logotherapy. He was also the author of "Man's Search for Meaning" about how his experience surviving the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz taught him that a purpose-driven life is the answer to overcoming obstacles and sorrows.Ken Mogi a Japanese neuroscientist and author of "Awakening Your Ikigai: How the Japanese Wake Up to Joy and Purpose Every Day" equates the ethos for ikigai to the famous British government slogan from World War II posters: "Keep Calm and Carry On."Frankl's logotherapy aims to help patients find their purpose in life. ("Logos" is the Greek word for "meaning.") If you feel anxious or empty it's because you are having an existential crisis Frankl argued. Logotherapy tends to be more forward looking rather than say looking for roots of discontent in your childhood. Therapy is one way to find your ikigai which is the "existential fuel" that motivates us to live long and happy as García and Miralles put it. Less expensive than therapy is asking yourself the question "what is the meaning of my life?" and pursuing activities that support your answer.Even more simple is the question "what do I love doing most?" Your ikigai may lie in the activities that tend to induce a state of being fully and delightfully immersed in that action what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called "flow" and Abraham Maslow called "peak experiences."Dr. Sanjay Gupta CNN's chief medical correspondent suggested another question to get at your ikigai: "If money were no object ... what would I regret not having done with my life?" There's no single way to learn your ikigai and the individual answers are even more varied. Your ikigai may be devotion to friends cooking being a good parent writing scientific inquiry fighting climate change drawing helping your neighbors and on and on.García and Miralles interviewed elderly residents of Ogimi Japan about their individual ikigai and their answers included "I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself" "getting together with my friends" and "making things with wicker." Ikigai doesn't need to be lofty or complicated and it's better not to stress about it. Ikigai is largely just the activity that will blissfully keep you busy until the end of your days. (And by pursuing it you'll probably have more of those days.)"You need to find your ikigai in the little things. You've got to start small. You need to be here and now" Mogi writes. "Most crucially you cannot and should not blame the environment for a lack of ikigai. After all it is up to you to find your own ikigai in your own way."Once you do that even if you don't live to age 100 your life may feel longer because you are more fully engaged with it while you are here. And living with purpose will encourage other behavior that promotes longevity. "Having ikigai would induce you to lead a healthier lifestyle with more exercise increased social activities and life-long learning" Mogi wrote to me in an email.  I also asked Mogi about his own personal ikigai. "I used to chase butterflies and study them as a kid. Now going for a run in the morning is my ikigai. Connecting to people of different backgrounds going over the borders of language ethnicity and nationality is probably the greatest ikigai of my life now" he wrote. "So ikigai can be small and big both of them equally important in one's life. Ikigai is a spectrum."As I think of my own ikigai the activities that give me the most flow are creative ones mostly writing (you are reading my ikigai!) storytelling and sharing experiences with my wife and kids. I like to think that these pursuits will have a wider impact on the world too. If I could spend every day for the rest of life pursuing those activities I'd die very happy and apparently very old.You and your ikigai: Till delayed death do you partOnce you find your ikigai there is really no reason to ever retire from it. The Japanese apparently don't even have a word for "retire." It's the not retiring from your purpose-driven life that seems to be the key factor of longevity and happiness on Okinawa.It's not as easy as that sounds of course. "Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning" García and Miralles write. "Powerful forces and incentives (money power attention success) distract us on a daily basis; don't let them take over your life."Instead they advise follow your curiosity and intuition which are the paths back to ikigai as is self-awareness. Find the activity you love surround yourself with people you love and stay true to that internal compass. Mogi has more advice on keeping your ikigai engine running smoothly. His five points boil down to: focus on the details accept yourself rely on others enjoy pleasure and stay present."There is a passion inside you a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end" García and Miralles write. Or great mythology teacher Joseph Campbell summed the more than 1000 words of advice in this story into just three: "Follow your bliss.",Health
 (CNN)An 11th child has died and 23 additional children have become sick in connection with an adenovirus outbreak at a New Jersey health care facility the state's Department of Health announced Friday.The children have weakened immune systems and other serious medical issues and many of them require assistance to breathe and function. They became sick at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell New Jersey. An ongoing investigation has revealed that not being able to separate the sick from those without symptoms -- in part due to "limitations in the facilities" -- is among the "major reasons for the outbreak being as severe as it has been" Dr. Shereef Elnahal commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health said Friday.But after deaths and hospitalizations the facility now has enough space to separate them."Up until this week it has not been possible to completely separate those patients" Elnahal said. "But now due to decreasing census at the facility it is."On Thursday health officials requested help separating those who are sick putting out a statewide call for volunteers from New Jersey Medical Reserve Corps. The health department has required that the Wanaque facility finish the process by Wednesday."The fact that we are continuing to see new confirmed cases at this point despite all efforts toward strict adherence to protocols has made the facility's layout limitations clear" Elnahal said in a statement this week.Citing "serious infection control deficiencies cited in ongoing inspections" the health department has also required the Wanaque facility to hire new staffers with expertise in infection control including an infectious disease doctor.State health officials are prohibiting any new admissions to the facility and requests to readmit former residents must be specifically approved.More on the outbreakState health officials have said the outbreak can be declared over only once four weeks pass without an additional case. Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus the state health department said.The children affected by the outbreak became ill between September 26 and November 12 according to the health department. The number has risen from 18 cases including six deaths announced last month by the health department.A staff member was also affected by the outbreak but has recovered.The outbreak in the Wanaque facility was caused by adenovirus type 7. This type is "most commonly associated with acute respiratory disease" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."This is an extremely severe strain of adenovirus that couldn't have occurred in a worse place" Elnahal said Friday.Other types of adenovirus infections can cause flu-like symptoms pinkeye and diarrhea.Eight cases of adenovirus have also been found among children at a second New Jersey facility Voorhees Pediatric Facility. However tests suggest that the culprit is adenovirus type 3 a different strain than the one in Wanaque.Patients at the Voorhees facility became ill between October 20 and November 9. A previous inspection by the state health department found no infection control problems and issued no citations.Health officials say they are stepping up efforts to strengthen infection control at such facilities in the state. The health department announced plans last month to deploy a team of infection control experts to visit University Hospital and four pediatric long-term care facilities this month including the Wanaque and Voorhees facilities where experts will train staffers and evaluate how these facilities prevent and control infections."Facility outbreaks are not always preventable but in response to what we have seen in Wanaque we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the chance they occur among the most vulnerable patients in New Jersey" Elnahal said in a statement.Adenoviruses are often spread by touching a contaminated person or surface or through the air by coughing or sneezing. They are known to persist on unclean surfaces and medical instruments for long periods of time and they may not be eliminated by common disinfectants but they rarely cause severe illness in healthy people. However people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of severe disease and they may remain contagious long after they recover according to the CDC.The infections and deaths come amid questions -- from former Wanaque Center employees the mothers of children who got sick at the facility and Elnahal himself -- about whether facility standards are high enough and whether more could have been done to prevent this from happening.Elnahal said in a statement that the findings of a recent unannounced health inspection at the Wanaque facility "raise questions about whether these general longterm care standards are optimal for this vulnerable population of medically fragile children."In statements last month the Wanaque facility said that it's working alongside health experts to investigate the outbreak and that it "promptly notified all appropriate government agencies when the virus was initially identified." According to state health department spokeswoman Nicole Kirgan health officials were notified of respiratory illness at the facility on October 9 and the facility notified parents 10 days later on October 19.The facility has declined multiple requests for comment.

 (CNN)Evacuees who fled the Camp Fire in California are facing norovirus outbreaks in shelters. The Butte County Public Health Department said that 145 people have been sick with vomiting and/or diarrhea since the shelters opened to evacuees and 41 people were experiencing symptoms at four different shelters as of Wednesday evening.Twenty-five people have been to the hospital for medical support the health department said in a statement."The number of sick people is increasing every day" the statement said.About 9700 homes were destroyed and 141000 acres burned in the fire. Sixty-three people have died due to the fire and more than 600 are missing. The Butte County health department is working with the Red Cross state and federal partners to reduce the spread of the illness at the evacuation shelters according to the statement released Thursday. Some of the actions being taken include establishing separate shelters for sick evacuees active monitoring of shelter residents and protective equipment for medical staff. What is norovirus? Norovirus which is sometimes called stomach flu or a stomach bug is "a very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea" according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It leads to 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the United States every year. The most common symptoms are stomach pain nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Fever headache and body aches can also be signs of norovirus. The CDC says that symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after a person is exposed and most people recover within one to three days. Norovirus can lead to dehydration particularly in young children older adults and those with other illnesses. Although there is currently no vaccine or medication to treat those with norovirus it is recommended that sick people drink a lot of liquids to prevent dehydration. Norovirus can spread easily and quickly particularly in crowded environments. It can spread through contaminated food contaminated water contaminated surfaces and through sick people.Some of the most common places for norovirus outbreaks are cruise ships nursing homes long-term health care facilities and at restaurants or catered events where groups of people are in close contact with each other in enclosed areas.  The CDC recommends practicing good hand hygiene cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and handling and preparing food safely in order to stop the transmission of the virus. They also say that people who are sick should not care for or prepare food for others. CNN's Nicole Chavez Jen Christensen and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)Alma Faz was just 19 when her right leg was amputated. It was "the lowest point in my life: 85 pounds cast on one leg surgeries and chemotherapy" Faz said. That was two decades ago just months after the Houston native was diagnosed with bone and ovarian cancer."I was athletic. I was a cheerleader when I was in high school so I liked to exercise" she said.  "I wanted to go to college. I wanted to build a career. You know just do want normal people do" Faz said. Instead Faz dropped out after just six weeks of college to undergo chemo and multiple surgeries."The reality became: Am I going to survive?" she said.Inspired to help save lives Six months after her amputation in 1998 Faz took her first steps. Inspired by the dedication of the staff at MD Anderson Cancer Center to saving her life she decided to go back to school to study computed tomography a medical imaging technology. "I'm in a wheelchair post-amputation having a CT scan and it came to me that this is what I want to do and this is where I want to do it" said Faz now 39. "Everybody was very caring and had a common goal for me. And so you can't put a price on that."Faz has now worked at MD Anderson for 15 years and manages a clinic that sees more than 100 patients a day. "There were so many people working to save my life" she said "so I thought 'one day I can work to save someone else's life.' "'I really wanted to run again'After losing her leg Faz was determined to get active again. But running was not an option."I did try but the prosthetics were not as advanced." she said. "So when I tried to run on that foot there was no natural movement to it. It was more just for walking." In 2009 she started an adolescent and young adult support group at the cancer center a resource she didn't have at the time of her diagnoses -- and realized she could do more. "Through them I went to kayaking camps ski trips and then there was the 'aha' moment" she said. "I really wanted to run again."Faz's leg was stable enough by the next year for doctors to build her a running prosthetic. She started an eighth of a mile at a time. "Before I knew it it was the whole park" she recalled. "Then it was a 5K then 10K." Faz has completed 21 half-marathons and a 26.2-mile marathon. And now she's training for a half-Ironman triathlon with a 1.2-mile swim a 56-mile bike ride and a 13.1-mile run."I have plenty of scars and I have a missing leg that reminds me every day of the sacrifices" she said. "But that pushes me every day to give more because I had the chance to survive." MD Anderson recently launched it's Adolescent and Young Adult Program. It focuses on fertility preservation along with psychosocial survivorship and genetic counseling needs for patients ages 15-29. Read more about this program here. ,Health
 (CNN)A 19-year-old died after inhaling deodorant spray to get high according to a new case report and doctors who treated the man in the Netherlands are using the case to highlight the fatal consequences of inhaling chemicals.Such cases are "very rare" according to Dr. Kelvin Harvey Kramp of Maasstad Hospital's intensive care unit in Rotterdam. Kramp explained that because deaths from deodorant inhalation are not common among the general population the "consequences aren't really known" causing people to continue this dangerous behavior. The patient who had a history of psychotic symptoms had been admitted to a rehabilitation center for cannabis and ketamine abuse and was taking antipsychotic drugs. During a relapse in July he placed a towel over his head and inhaled deodorant spray to get high according to the report published Thursday in the BMJ. He became hyperactive jumping up and down before blood flow stopped suddenly causing him to go into cardiac arrest and collapse the report says. He was admitted to the hospital and placed in a medically induced coma when staff failed to revive him. The "patient did not had enough brain function to sustain life" Kramp said. Nine days after he was admitted doctors withdrew care and the man died. There are three theories about what caused the cardiac arrest Kramp said: The inhalant could have oversensitized the patient's heart which can make any subsequent stress like getting caught by a parent cause cardiac arrest. Also inhalants decrease the strength of contraction of the heart muscle. Another possibility is that inhalants can cause spasm of the coronary arteries. The patient's hyperactivity could mean he was experiencing a "scary hallucination" Kramp said adding that if that was the case the first theory would be applicable.Solvent abuse is not a new phenomenon the report points out and is primarily found in "young and vulnerable people" according to Kramp.The group most affected by solvent abuse is 15- to 19-year-olds studies show. People in rehabilitation centers or prisons are more likely to abuse household products the report added meaning there could be a greater risk of cardiac deaths in these environments. In these secure environments people have less access to other substances and household products are easily available explained Roz Gittins director of pharmacy at the British drug charity Addaction who was not involved in the report. The toxic chemical butane often used in sprayable household products has a similar effect to alcohol Kramp said. "The intention of abusers is to experience feelings of euphoria and disinhibition."Other health effects of inhalants include liver and kidney damage hearing loss delayed behavioral development and brain damage. Chemicals like butane have a very quick and short-acting effect which can make people want to take more Gittins said.The report's authors hope increased awareness will help reduce further inhalant-related deaths through education in schools around the fatal consequences of solvent abuse."To stop the abuse we can only try to increase awareness about the possible dramatic consequences of inhalant abuse among youngsters parents medical personnel" Kramp said.Up to 125 deaths are caused by inhalant abuse every year in the United States according to the report. Stephen Ream director of UK-based charity Re-solv said that in 2016 "there were 64 deaths associated with these products" with butane gas accounting for at least a third of those. "The breakdown by product is more difficult to establish but we would suspect that about four or five deaths a year are associated with aerosol products" he said."Solvent abuse is also more of a problem in the northern regions of the UK with rates particularly higher in Scotland and the North East of England."According UK drug advice organization Talk to Frank more 10- to 15-year-olds were killed from abusing glues gases and aerosols than from illegal drugs combined between 2000 and 2008.This article has been changed to include updated remarks from Roz Gittins.,Health
 (CNN)Your baby's pacifier falls on the floor. Before giving it back to your child do you wash it in a sink or perhaps reluctantly clean it with your own saliva?Don't feel too guilty if you chose the latter because a new study suggests that a mother's spit -- and the bacteria in it -- may help prevent allergies in young children.The research found lower levels of a troublesome allergy-causing protein in babies whose mothers reported sucking on their infants' pacifiers adding to a growing body of evidence that early exposure to microbes may prevent allergies in children."The idea is that the microbes you're exposed to in infancy can affect your immune system's development later on in life" said Dr. Eliane Abou-Jaoude an allergy fellow with the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. She is presenting her findings this weekend at the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting. Microbial exposure might prevent allergiesResearch has shown that people who live near livestock those who avoid dishwashers and babies born through the microbe-filled vaginal canal -- instead of via C-section -- are all less likely to develop allergies. The new study which hasn't been peer-reviewed is "one more piece of data that early exposure to microbes helps prevent allergies" said Dr. Andrew MacGinnitie clinical director of the Division of Immunology at Boston Children's Hospital. But the study has weaknesses as well MacGinnitie said. It has a small sample size making it difficult to draw too many conclusions and factors other than the mother's saliva could have helped develop the children's immune systems."It's possible that sucking on a pacifier is correlated with other more important factors that predispose or protect against allergens" he said adding that mothers who suck on their children's pacifiers could also "let their kids play in the dirt or their whole house could be less clean."Uncertainty over causation is why Abou-Jaoude isn't recommending that parents start sucking on their children's pacifiers just yet."What's very very important to realize is that this was not a cause and effect study" she said. "This is not telling you if you suck on your child's pacifier they will not develop allergies."For those who choose to do so though MacGinnitie doesn't see too many risks. "If the kid were sick he or she could transmit an infection to the mom or dad but if the kid is well this would seem to be unlikely" he said.And even if the pacifier falls on the floor he added "in general the bacteria and viruses on the floor don't cause disease."A decrease in allergy-linked proteinsTo determine allergy risk researchers looked for a protein linked to allergies. They tracked levels of that protein the IgE antibody in 74 infants whose mothers reported using pacifiers. No fathers were included in the research.Just nine babies had mothers who sucked their children's binkies clean. But compared with the other children those nine babies had significantly lower levels of IgE antibody a trend that began when the children were about 10 months old. The researchers tracked the babies for only 18 months making it unclear whether lower IgE levels in infancy would translate to fewer allergies later in life."Based on these levels you can't really tell what's going to happen to these kids in the future" Abou-Jaoude said. "All is we know is people with allergies they usually have higher levels of IgE antibodies. But that doesn't mean that if you have high IgE you're definitely going to have allergies."Our bodies develop antibodies to fight infections but MacGinnitie said IgE antibodies are often produced in response to harmless substances -- which is why they're closely associated with allergies."Allergies are an inappropriate response by our immune system to see something that's innocuous as dangerous" he said leading to congestion hives and other common symptoms.Reducing your child's allergy riskAbou-Jaoude's team looked at total IgE antibody levels but researchers can also test for allergen-specific IgE levels looking at how sensitive a child might be to particular substances like eggs or dogs.A 2013 study in Sweden did just that. Not only did researchers find that infants were less likely to have IgE antibodies against common allergens when their parents sucked their pacifiers but they were also less likely to develop eczema and asthma by the time they were 18 months old."If I understand the paper and the figure correct [the new study] found lower IgE levels in children whose parents reported sucking on their pacifier and that finding supports our results" said Dr. Bill Hesselmar an associate professor in pediatrics at the University of Gothenburg who authored that study. In both cases Hesselmar says sucking on a baby's pacifier might have transferred "microbes that could stimulate the immune system so that tolerance develops instead of allergy."Still there are more practical -- and perhaps more pleasant -- ways to prevent allergies in children. MacGinnitie said that early exposure to some foods for example may protect against allergies. Studies have shown that "kids introduced to peanuts in the first year of life have a much lower chance of developing a peanut allergy" he said and the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees. In 2017 the group endorsed guidelines recommending that infants at high risk for allergies start eating peanuts as early as 4 to 6 months of age. Children who grow up with pets also tend to have a lower allergy risk MacGinnitie said but that might be explained by genetics. In other words allergy-free parents who own pets might just give birth to allergy-free kids."Living on a small farm also probably helps" MacGinnitie joked. But he added that for most parents "that's probably not realistic.",Health
 (CNN)Men who work in construction and extraction had the highest rates of suicide in the United States according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For women suicide rates were highest among those who work in arts design entertainment sports and media.From 2000 to 2016 the suicide rate among the US working-age population -- people 16 to 64 -- increased 34% the report says.Using information from the 17 states that participated in the 2012 and 2015 National Violent Death Reporting System the CDC analyzed the suicide deaths of 22053 Americans of working age. Occupations were classified using the Standard Occupational Classifications from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2015 the construction and extraction field had the highest rates of suicides for men with 53.2 suicides per 100000 working people. Women in arts design entertainment sports and media had a suicide rate of 15.6 per 100000 working people in 2015.Arts design entertainment sports and media saw the largest increase in suicides among men: 47% from 2012 to 2015.For women the largest increase -- 54% from 2012 to 2015 -- was among food preparation and serving-related occupations such as chefs bar managers and baristas. The occupational groups with the highest rates of suicide for men were:Construction and extraction: jobs such as carpenters electricians and miners Arts design entertainment sports and media: jobs such as illustrators tattooists and professional sports playersInstallation maintenance and repair: jobs such as mechanics cable installers and commercial divers For women they were:Arts design entertainment sports and media: jobs such as illustrators animators tattooists and professional sports playersProtective service: jobs such as police officers private investigators and TSA workers Health care support: jobs such as dental assistants massage therapists and pharmacy aidesFor both sexes the occupational group with the lowest rate of suicides was education training and library. This includes jobs such as teachers professors and archivists. However the rates for women were too low to report in some occupational fields. There are some limitations to the research. These results might not be nationally representative because they come from only 17 states the report notes.More knowledge about the distribution of suicide by career group could be useful to help inform prevention programs and policies it said."Because many adults spend a substantial amount of their time at work the workplace is an important but underutilized location for suicide prevention" the authors say. Nearly 45000 lives were lost to suicide in 2016 according to a report released by the CDC this year. Suicide rates rose in nearly every state from 1999 to 2016 and in half of these states the increase was more than 30%. When it comes to suicide prevention the CDC recommends strategies such as "enhancing social connectedness and expanding access to relevant resources strengthening state or local economic supports implementing practices that encourage help-seeking and decrease stigma and providing referrals to mental health and other services."How to get help: In the United States call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.

 (CNN)A new report a British advisory body has called for a 20%-50% cut in the number of sheep and cattle to help combat climate change -- adding to the growing international consensus that eating red meat is not only bad for your health it is also bad for the environment.  Lamb beef and dairy production accounts for the majority of greenhouse gases emitted by farms in Britain with sheep and cattle directly responsible for around 58% of agricultural emissions in the UK in 2016 says the report by the government's Committee on Climate Change (CCC).The advisory body suggests that a dramatic reduction in the consumption of cow and sheep products could release up to 7 million hectares of grassland which could instead be planted to create forests and help store carbon. It recommends that the UK's land under forestry should increase to 19% from 14%. The committee also said a reduction in beef and lamb consumption would lead to a rise in the consumption of plant-based food as well as chicken and pork. The government's "Eatwell Guide" for a healthy and balanced diet outlines the proportion of a person's diet that each food group should provide. The report says that following these guidelines would lead to a dramatic reduction in the amount of red meat eaten by the population with an 89% reduction for beef and a 63% reduction for lamb. This would also see a 20% decline in dairy products.  The target of reducing sheep and cattle numbers by 20%-50% also relies on people following the recommended diet with the 20% goal achievable if people replace red meat with chicken and pork. The higher 50% goal would involve people switching to meat alternatives or substitutes.The report which has an overarching goal to create a "a new land use policy" that will help mitigate climate change also includes recommendations to increase Britain's forested area as well as the restoration of the country's peatlands and the reduction of flood risks. "This is a wake-up call for a complacent government that we must completely transform the way we use land to avoid climate breakdown and make space for nature" Friends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said in a statement. "As the Committee on Climate Change says we need to free up land from agriculture by eating much less meat and dairy and stop landowners burning and degrading peat bogs -- our single biggest carbon store."Animal farming is responsible for 14.5% of the world's greenhouse emissions according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization making it a significant contributor to climate change. Of those emissions 65% comes from beef and dairy cattle. A recent report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emphasized the need for people to consume about 30% less animal products. Eating less meat is one of a number of mitigation strategies suggested by the IPCC to overhaul agricultural and land-use practices including the protection of forests. A study last month predicted that as a result of population growth and the continued consumption of large amounts of red meat and processed food in the West the environmental pressures from the food system could increase by up to 90% by 2050.CNN's Meera Senthilingam contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)Traffic control measures have improved air quality in London but the number of children with poor lung capacity because of traffic pollution remains high a new analysis says. Low-emission zones -- areas with a daily charge for vehicles that don't meet emission requirements -- were introduced in 2008 and have led to small improvements in nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels found in diesel emissions according to a study published Wednesday.But no improvements were seen in levels of particulate matter -- PM10 less than 10 micrometers in diameter -- which can cause premature death and worsening of heart and lung diseases according to the London Air Quality Network. Despite a reduction in some pollutants the study found no evidence of a decline in the number of children with reduced lung capacities or asthmatic symptoms since the implementation of the zone in London. The authors stress that more ambitious control measures are needed to improve childhood respiratory health."Traffic pollution harms children's health particularly development of lungs" said Chris Griffiths professor of primary care at Queen Mary University of London who co-led the research.The impact of zoningLow emission zones restrict or penalize the entry of polluting vehicles and are often the biggest part of emissions-reducing strategies according to the study. London's current zone requires the most polluting diesel vehicles to meet European guidelines. In 2008 London introduced the world's largest citywide low-emission zone encompassing 8.5 million residents. There are 200 other such zones across Europe and several in Asian cities such as Singapore and Tokyo. Griffiths' team is the first to look at the effects of large-scale traffic emission controls on air quality improvements and at their effects on children's health he said. Each year from 2009 through 2013 they measured the lung capacity of 400 different primary-school children between 8 and 9 years old in four East London boroughs. All four boroughs were within London's low emission zone and are heavily polluted exceeding European Union limits on nitrogen dioxide at the start of the study. Average exposure concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured annually at each child's home and school addresses."The introduction of lower-emission zones did improve air quality but had less of an effect than expected" Griffiths said. They hoped to see children's lung capacity grow year by year as the zoning should reduce pollution but the researchers found the opposite: Their lung capacity was an estimated 5% smaller than it would otherwise be. "Although changes of this magnitude are unlikely to cause problems in healthy children we urgently need to know whether these lung deficits will impact lung function and health in later life" Griffiths said. At the study's start 99% of the children were living in areas that exceeded the European Union's limits for nitrogen oxide. By 2013 34% were living in areas that exceeded EU limits -- but many went to schools that had higher levels of pollution next to busy roads according to the paper."Doctors should consider advising parents of children with clinically significant lung disease to avoid living in highly polluted areas or to adopt personal mitigation measures to limit their exposure" Griffiths said.Improving child healthA reduction in lung capacity can lead to stunted lungs which is dangerous for two reasons Griffiths said. First it increases the risk of asthma and worsens the condition in those who have it. In the long term it can also be problematic for adults as lung size is a good predictor for life expectancy for reasons that are not exactly clear. With age the lungs start to decline and if people enter adulthood with already declining lungs this will lower their life expectancy he explained."All of the children involved in this study lost some degree of lung function from breathing toxic air" said Dr. Penny Woods chief executive of the British Lung Foundation who was not involved in the research. "What this means is that we urgently need to go much further to protect people right now."Griffiths highlighted that the study would have benefited from a comparison group of children living in an area of similar poor air quality and without any zoning regulations in place. Also a larger number of children would have helped strengthen the findings.About 93% of children globally breathe polluted air according to the World Health Organization and 4.2 million deaths every year are caused by outdoor air pollution.Some of the world's most polluted cities include Peshawar Pakistan; Varanasi India; Cairo Egypt's capital; and Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia.Is ultra the next step?In April Central London will be equipped with a new version of the traffic control measure: an ultra-low-emission zone in which vehicles will have to meet stricter exhaust emission standards or drivers must pay a daily charge to travel within the zone. The measure will encompass a larger area of London to include more than 3.6 million additional residents by 2021. It will also require that vehicles meet updated European guidelines on gas and diesel vehicles. "It is predicted to have much bigger impacts on health" Griffiths said and the research team is conducting a new study on the upgraded zone's effectiveness.Ultimately "a big step forward" to deal with traffic pollution would be to move away from cars that use diesel or gas and switch to electric vehicles he said. Even in that case there would be pollution created from tires and breaks the researcher added.  The British government also encourages such vehicles through grants of up to 4500 pounds (US $5800) to buy environmentally friendly cars. "It is disappointing that the low-emission zone in London has not helped to improve children's lung capacity and [the study] shows that a piecemeal approach to reducing air pollution does not work" said Samantha Walker director of research and policy at the charity Asthma UK."If children's lungs don't develop properly as a result of air pollution it can increase their likelihood of developing asthma leaving them coughing wheezing and at risk of a life-threatening asthma attack." Stefan Reis head of atmospheric chemistry and effects at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology added that the study "highlights a key challenge for the implementation of policy interventions to improve air quality." "Planned measures aiming to reduce population exposure in urban areas and in particular vulnerable groups such as children or older adults need to be adequately assessed prior to implementation.",Health
 (CNN)For years researchers analyzing traumatic injuries found on Neanderthal fossils believed they had lived dangerous violent lives.But a new study reveals that early modern humans and Neanderthals both suffered the same level of head trauma. Like a recent study dispelling the hunched caveman stereotype this new research suggests that Neanderthals didn't invite injury through inferior hunting techniques or dangerous lifestyles. Instead the fossils of Neanderthals and humans show that life between 40000 and 50000 years ago was dangerous for all.Previous studies of Neanderthals usually compared them with the modern humans of today. But the researchers on this new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature used a quantitative database of recorded trauma in 295 Neanderthal bones and 541 human bones. The human bones from Upper Paleolithic modern humans had the same level of preservation and shared similar aspects of their environment in Western Eurasia with Neanderthals. The modeling also accounted for gender age at the time of death and geography.The researchers discovered through their analysis that males were injured more frequently than females among both humans and Neanderthals -- probably because of gender-specific behaviors activities and division of labor. "For me the most important impact of the study is the better understanding of Neanderthals" Katerina Harvati study author and professor at the University of Tübingen's Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment wrote in an email. "This study elucidates the population rates head trauma of Neanderthals compared to those of Upper Paleolithic modern humans which have implications for their assumed behavior."Neanderthals were believed to have sustained head trauma due to violent social behavior their hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Ice Age environments and attacks by large carnivorous animals. Museum models show them stabbing or thrusting with spears at close range to their prey causing close confrontations during hunting. Harvati said that because of these findings those commonly cited behaviors should be reconsidered. "Our results suggest that Neanderthal lifestyles were not more dangerous than those of our ancestors early modern Europeans" she said.One surprising difference was age-related. Though traumatic injuries spanned ages for humans Neanderthals were more likely to have died before reaching 30. This suggests that Neanderthals were either more likely to be injured at a younger age or more likely to die after being injured.Perhaps these differences provide insight as to why humans had an advantage over Neanderthals suggests Marta Mirazón Lahr author of an accompanying News and Views article. Lahr in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge did not participate in the research. Though the research team only looked at head trauma studying other injuries preserved in the fossils and how those injuries might have happened could shed more light on behavior activities or social norms that have eluded us about Neanderthals and our ancestors Lahr said. Harvati said the team is "planning to extend our analyses to the rest of the skeleton but also to later samples for example later Upper Paleolithic specimens so to gain better insights into possible trends of injury rates through time.",Health
Samutprakarn Thailand (CNN)Anucha Tasako was just 13 years old when he stepped into the Muay Thai ring to fight a boy just two years older for prize money of around 2000 Thai Baht ($60).He'd done it almost 200 times before but Saturday's fight was his last.Anucha died after being knocked unconscious and suffering a hemorrhage at his brain stem according to Sub. Lt. Rawin Nasomsong of the Royal Thai Police's Institute of Forensic Medicine.The death of the young fighter from Kalasin Province in Thailand's northeast has led to calls for reform to the sport and its practice of using boys and young men -- sometimes as young as seven years old -- to compete in professional bouts. Tourism and Sports Minister Weerasak Kowsurat has vowed to introduce further legislation to the country's Boxing Act to protect young fighters the Bangkok Post reports. The amendment to the country's Boxing Act would ban all fighters younger than age 12 and require all those between 12 and 15 years old to be provided with safety equipment especially head guards. "This draft stipulates the criteria concerning ages of young people who want to compete in this sport" he said adding that the Ministry "will rush through the process to forward it to the cabinet for consideration as quickly as possible." 'He died like a warrior'Anucha started practicing Muay Thai at the age of seven or eight said Damrong Tasako the teenager's uncle who raised him from the age of three. Tasako added the teen was "very talented."He first fought in the ring when he was eight years old his uncle told CNN winning his first match that came with a prize of 300 Thai Baht ($9). The prize money for his match on Saturday was 2000 Thai Baht ($60).Anucha wanted to train in Muay Thai because he wanted to earn money to buys things said Tasako. To date Anucha has taken part in an estimated 170 fights."His dream was he always wanted to be a champion at Lumpini Stadium or Ratchadamneon Stadium" he said referring to the two main Muay Thai venues in Bangkok. "Also if he could he wanted to enter military cadet school."When asked about Anucha's death his uncle said he didn't blame anyone. "He died like a warrior. He was a fighter."A religious ceremony in honor of the teenager took place Wednesday in Samutprakarn Province in central Thailand where his final fight took place. His is body will be cremated Thursday.Damrong said that they had met his opponent a boy two years older than Anucha who paid his respects at the temple where the 13-year-old's body had been laid in repose. The older boy had started boxing even earlier at age 6. He told CNN he had his first paid fight just a year after that. After Anucha's death he says he received a lot of vitriol on social media but also enormous support. To honor Anucha's memory he's participating in the boy's cremation ceremony as a novice monk; Thais can temporarily join a monastery.However the death of his opponent has not deterred him from stepping into the ring."I want to continue on this road as a Muay Thai boxer and see how far I can go" he said.Shining light on the issueActivists and doctors have tried several times to amend the child boxing bill but their attempts have never been successful said Dr. Witaya Sungkarat chief of the Thai Child Boxers Research Project at Mahidol University adding that the news of Anucha's death has just shone a big light on this issue again."We have never recommended a total ban of Muay Thai boxing" said Sungkarat. "But we want them to avoid hitting the head of the child until they are at least 15 years old." His institute has carried out research scanning the brains of children who take part in Muay Thai and comparing them against children who don't. The result has clearly shown that brain development of kids who don't compete in Muay Thai are different from kids whose heads were hit in matches said Sungkarat. The results were heeded by the new draft bill which remains with the Ministry of Tourism and Sports Promotion to review he added.Correction: ,Health
 (CNN)You can expect a "drinking checkup" when you visit the doctor. All adults including pregnant women should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use by their primary care physicians the United States Preventive Services Task Force advises. For those patients who drink above the recommended limits doctors should provide brief counseling to help them reduce their drinking according to the new task force statement published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA.As far as teens the independent panel of medical experts came up empty. The task force said it did not find enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against alcohol screening and counseling for those under the age of 18. The panel is calling for more research. Unhealthy alcohol use means drinking beyond the recommended limits. No more than four drinks in a single day and 14 drinks in a week is the line drawn for men age 21 to 64 according to National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. For women and older men the institute advises no more than three drinks in one day and no more than seven drinks in a week. There is no safe level of alcohol for pregnant women according to the institute.The negative consequences of too much alcohol include illness injury and death -- unhealthy alcohol use ranks as the third leading preventable cause of death in the US according to the task force. When pregnant women drink birth defects and developmental problems in their children may follow.Too many doctors don't speak up about alcohol The new recommendation is a simple update of the task force's long-standing position. Since 1996 the task force has recommended doctors screen and briefly counsel adults for unhealthy drinking and before that in 1989 it recommended physicians ask their patients to describe how they use alcohol. "Yet implementation of screening and brief intervention still remains quite low" Angela Bazzi and Dr. Richard Saitz both of Boston University School of Public Health wrote in an editorial published with the new guidelines in JAMA. "For example in the United States 1 in 6 patients reports having discussed alcohol with their physician; rates in Europe are similarly low."Bazzi and Saitz note that the World Health Organization supports screening and brief counseling for unhealthy drinking in adults while the American Academy of Pediatrics does so for youth. Even small steps are beneficialThe lack of discussion in doctors' offices continues despite high prevalence of unhealthy drinking "evidence for screening and brief intervention efficacy substantial government funding practice guidelines and quality measures and incentives" wrote the editorial authors.  Behavioral counseling interventions include in-person or web-based sessions that are usually short for example just one to four sessionstwo hours or less of total contact time according to the task force.   In studies patients who have been advised to cut back on alcohol often report that they have done so to please the researchers while reviews find no effects on objective measures of alcohol consumption (their blood levels) or the rates of injuries alcohol-related illnesses and hospitalizations according to Bazzi and Saitz. Still "even small behavior changes" could improve health they wrote."The societal context must change" wrote Bazzi and Staitz. They added that less use of alcohol "is better for health.",Health
 (CNN)If you're sitting down while reading this stand up. Guidelines released Monday by the federal government show that most Americans are not getting the exercise they need costing the health care system over $100 billion each year.The new standards are similar to those released 10 years ago but the government is scrapping a recommendation that physical activity occur in 10-minute blocks instead telling Americans to "move more and sit less" whenever possible.Any amount of exercise has some health benefits officials say and some benefits are even immediate like better quality of sleep or reduced anxiety."The new guidelines demonstrate that based on the best science everyone can dramatically improve their health just by  moving -- anytime anywhere and by any means that gets you active" said Dr. Brett P. Giroir assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services.The guidelines recommend an hour of "moderate-to-vigorous" activity each day for children 6 to 17 along with muscle-strengthening activities two days a week like climbing on playground equipment or playing basketball. For the first time the guidelines also recommend that preschool-age children have at least three hours of "active play" each day. For older children and adults moderate-to-vigorous activity can include brisk walking running or "anything that makes the heart beat faster" and adults should aim for about 2½ hours each week. But just 26% of men 19% of women and 20% of adolescents are meeting the standards officials said costing the US health care system $117 billion each year and leading to about 10% of premature deaths. The findings were published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "When we move more we have better cardiovascular health we are stronger and less susceptible to disease and we feel better" Giroir said. "Physical activity can help manage chronic conditions that many Americans already have."Based on new evidence the updated guidelines say exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety slow the progression of hypertension and Type 2 diabetes and help prevent eight types of cancer in adults.Exercise can also improve cognition in those with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or dementia the guidelines say and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease."These guidelines are fairly clear that there's strong evidence that physical activity reduces a person's risk for developing dementia" said Keith Fargo director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association.The group which was not involved in crafting the guidelines says that exercise isn't a cure for Alzheimer's but it notes that physical activity and other lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of cognitive decline. "That's something you can do right now today" Fargo said "People can begin to take their risk for dementia into their own hands."The American Heart Association announced Monday that it would adopt the government's exercise standards. "We urge other health groups and interested parties across the country to adopt the guidelines and join us in committing to help ensure more people get moving" said Dr. Ivor Benjamin the group's president adding that exercise can "help people live longer healthier lives for themselves their families and their communities.",Health
 (CNN)Having children tends to increase our agony during moments of violence. I don't know a parent who after hearing about innocent people being hurt or killed doesn't instinctively reach for their kids and long to never let go. This feeling is especially strong when the violence was directed toward a group with whom your family identifies. What if it was us?My family consists of conservative Jews who regularly attend a conservative synagogue just like the Jews who were recently killed in Pittsburgh. Hate-filled trolls have repeatedly threatened violence against me and my Jewish children on social media. It's getting harder and harder to not think about the unthinkable.But after the initial agony passes and we release our children from our immobilizing grips their presence can actually help us work through these dark moments. Children have lots of questions and tend to be dogged pursuers of moral clarity. It's rarely enough for them to learn that something happened. They want to understand why it happened and will keep why-why-why-ing their way through each and every piece of information provided to them. At the end of this road sits the biggest question of them all the question not about the act of violence but about what would make someone do something like that in the first place. How does one help them make sense of hate?This is not an easy task. Intense hate is for most of us a foreign emotion one we have never felt.We must talk to our children about it anyway explaining to them why someone hates them where this hate comes from and how it has been dealt with in the past. While this conversation should absolutely include an acknowledgment of all the other groups who are the target of it the processing of hate best happens through particulars -- of a people of a history of a moment. In my family this means viewing hate through a Jewish lens.Begin with the past The Jewish holiday cycle rests largely upon a series of ancient stories in which Jews were persecuted for being Jewish and then ultimately prevail. During Passover we remember when we were slaves in Egypt. During Purim we remember when our lives were threatened in ancient Persia. And so on."They tried to kill us we survived let's eat" goes the old joke a pithy summary of many Jewish holidays. When children receive a Jewish education it's these stories the Jewish communal memory that take prominence. Is it strange to hear preschool children discuss the various ways in which one group of people can express their hatred of another? "Sometimes the Jews want to stay but aren't allowed to and sometimes the Jews want to leave and aren't allowed to" my son reflected at age 5. Yes it's strange. But there's no Judaism without it.So how does one take our history in which hatred of the Jews is a leitmotif and use it to help our children make sense of the present? Shai Held rabbi Jewish theologia and author of "The Heart of the Torah" said stories of past persecution can help us understand how hate is sadly an inescapable part of the human experience. "Any religious perspective on the world is going to emphasize that human nature is messy and complex and human beings are prone to hate" he said. "There is oddly something helpful in knowing there is nothing new here. ... It allows you some degree of sobriety."An incident of hate becomes a chance to discuss not just hate but the ways all of us contain within us the capacity for bad and good. No we aren't ever likely to find a way to stop that bad from occasionally growing into violent hate in some people. But if we pay attention we will notice that expressions of hate are often met by expressions of love and compassion.In nearly every ancient story of hate there are non-Jewish people who fight on Jews' behalf. Last month Jews saw non-Jews of all backgrounds join us in mourning and protest."I think it is always powerful to remind kids that if someone hates you it doesn't mean everyone hates you" Held said.A reckoning with hate when rooted in Jewish history is also a reckoning with resilience. Yes lots and lots of people have hated us incensed by the mere fact that we are not exactly like them. But they didn't win. Held said parents could emphasize this against-the-odds survival of the Jews as a point of relief if not pride for children. "Thousands of years of antisemitism has instilled in us a deep persistence" he said. Connect it to childhood feelingsWe all old and young have an instinct to trace hate back to its source. Where does it come from? And how does it take shape?Children (and their parents) might get some insight into how hate develops by studying the behavior of their younger siblings cousins or friends. Wariness of all people and things unfamiliar begins to unfold in the early years of life explained Fred Zelinger a New York-based psychologist who previously worked in schools."We are wired to be uncomfortable with things that are different" he said. "Most kids outgrow it past age 3 but some environments can make it flourish."If a child is never exposed to other cultures or is told that these other cultures are bad then that perfectly natural "stranger danger" can morph into something more menacing and permanent. This is particularly the case with people who have fragile self-esteems and seek to improve their standing by putting down or eliminating those who they see as a threat. A good way to show children how all this works is by deliberately modeling the complete opposite explained Laurie Zelinger child psychologist and author of "Please Explain Terrorism to Me: A Story for Children." Speak kindly about other groups of people; eat in their restaurants; play alongside them at playgrounds; learn about and when possible celebrate their holidays; invite them over your house. This is especially important during moments of communal fear when calls for diversity in speech are not often met by diversity in action."When people feel scared they have an instinct to insulate their children and keep them away from anything they are nervous about" she said. Focus on the oppositeThere's an underlying element of hate that will likely remain inscrutable to children -- and everyone else. When we hit the edge of our ability to process it the best and really only place to turn to is toward the goodness the majority of us contain within.Out of all that was written in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting the one phrase that provided me with the most comfort was a declaration of the human capacity for good. "May we redouble our efforts towards kindness and love" my rabbi wrote in an email sent hours after the killings took place."One of the things that is striking about Jewish theology is that Jews are supposed to learn compassion and empathy from two places. We learn it from God's compassion which is the positive model. And we learn it from our suffering in Egypt which is the negative model. Whether you have a positive or negative experience you are supposed to learn empathy" Held explained.Love is not sadly the only answer to hate. Vigilance education self-defense and self-care are all necessary too. But it's our unyielding belief in human goodness that makes it all worth it. I believe most children already feel this but it is up to us to help them understand it.Elissa Strauss writes about the politics and culture of parenthood.,Health
Hate speech is all over the internet. Fueled by trolls extremists false information and a group mentality this kind of cruelty against a religion ethnicity sexual identity gender race -- or anything really -- has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet looking up a definition or maybe checking out some music they'll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video a meme in their feed or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas the frequency with which kids see them and the acceptance by so many that it's just part of internet life mean that it's critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They'll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it's hurtful what to do when they encounter it and even what to do if they're drawn to it.Hate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment -- unless it specifically targets someone includes threats and harassment or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what's OK and what's absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it today's kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram Twitter and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech -- which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race- religion- and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups they must wonder why adults can't stop these hate crimes.How to talk to kids about difficult subjectsLet's be clear: The internet didn't create hate speech. Although it may change some people's minds the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn't account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information which is easily created easily distributed and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people -- and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.Somewhere in this mix are your kids who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing scary and shaky. We can't -- and shouldn't -- rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don't have that much time. And plus they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately hate speech is an area where sharing your own family's values -- around compassion and tolerance appropriate communication and empathy toward other -- sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.Fact-checking tools for teens and tweensConversation startersWhat is hate speech? Look up the definition of hate speech and talk about whether your kids have encountered it. It may have been just a word or it may have been in a video or a meme. How can you tell if someone is trying to be funny or their words are intended to hurt?How does hate speech affect people? How would you feel if you were a member of the group targeted by cruel language? Does it matter if you're exposed to it a lot or a little? Are people with different social statuses -- for example a popular kid vs. a loner type -- affected differently?What's the difference between hate speech and cyberbullying? If someone is trying to hurt someone or knows that they're hurting someone and does it repeatedly that's cyberbullying. When someone expresses vicious views about a group or toward an attribute of a group that's hate speech.What's your role in online hate speech? Do you feel safe calling out the person or people using hate speech? Would it make you feel cooler to do that or would it make you feel uncool -- like you're not part of the group? Would you block people using hate speech? Would you ignore them? Would you stand up for the person or group of people being targeted?5 ways to help kids deal with disturbing newsHow far does the right to free speech go? Is there a clear boundary between free speech and hate speech? What is it? Should people have the right to say and do whatever they want online? If people's feelings are hurt or they're offended they can just go on a different site right?Does hate speech lead to hate crimes? Convicted killer Dylann Roof accused murderer Robert Bowers and others accused of hate crimes left clues to their murderous views online. Should there be a place for people with extremist leanings to gather and share their ideas online even if they're offensive and threatening? Or not?What responsibility -- if any -- do technology platforms have? Should Instagram for example be held accountable to victims of hate crimes committed by users who posted hate content? Should they try to bring people together either through dedicated spaces new algorithms or other methods?Why are certain people attracted to hate groups? It's natural for tweens and teens to want to join groups and sometimes groups devoted to hurting others make certain kids feel more powerful. Kids who have pent-up anger or insecurity about other things in their lives may be attracted to groups that feel protective and united. Can you imagine why someone might be swayed by hate speech rhetoric?Practical ways to manage hate speechReport it. Hate speech violates most sites' terms of service. You can report people without their knowing that you're the one who turned them in.Block it. You can block people who use hate speech but this can be tricky socially for some kids.Don't share it. Forwarding any form of hate speech is wrong -- but it can also get you into trouble because it can be traced back to you.Call it out. If your kids feel confident enough to confront the hate speech poster without fear of attack then they should do it.Fight it. Nurture the values of empathy and compassion in your kids. Challenge them to consider how other people feel and how they would want to be treated.Read age-appropriate news from reputable sources. Try these best news sources for kids.Learn more. Hate often stems from ignorance. Media designed for your kids' ages can help them learn about history and people's struggles in terms that they can understand and relate to.

 (CNN)Vitamin D and omega-3 supplements do not prevent cancer or heart disease a new study finds the latest in the years-long debate over their benefits. The trial enrolled more than 25000 Americans of various ethnicities who were over the age of 50 and had no history of cancer heart attack stroke or other forms of heart disease.Participants were randomly assigned a daily dose of vitamin D omega-3 or a placebo. After more than five years no significant heart disease or cancer difference was seen between those taking supplements and those taking a placebo.Lead researcher Dr. JoAnn E. Manson chief of the Division of Preventive Medincine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School said the study distinguishes itself because it is the world's largest randomized trial of its kind.Previous research has looked at bone health or used high-risk populations she added but her study had the "the primary aims to look if vitamin D and omega-3 could reduce risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease" in typical people with no history of such conditions.The results of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL -- known as VITAL -- were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2018 in Chicago and published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine. VITAL's initial trial took place last year and included more than 8000 participants. Research has suggested that the fatty acid omega-3 could prevent cancers and cardiovascular diseases the study says and vitamin D has been suggested to reduce cancer risks because there are fewer cancer cases in countries with high sun exposure. Such observational studies are susceptible to confounding factors for a lower cancer rate in places where there is greater sun exposure because people who spend more time outside are most likely also engaging in other healthy habits such as exercise."If you're already taking one or both of these supplements there's no clear reason to stop. If you want to consider starting our recommendation is to talk with your health care provider but this does not need to be done on an urgent basis" Manson said.Little protection from vitamin DThe study was a large clinical randomized trial noted Brian Power honorary senior dietitian at University College London Hospital and lecturer in nutrition who was not involved in the research. He described it in an email as "the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness of interventions of this sort; bias and confounding are reduced."Looking at moderate to high dosages of 2000 IU of vitamin D 1617 people developed cancer; of these 793 were regular vitamin D takers and 824 were in the placebo group.Also 905 participants developed major cardiovascular events such as stroke heart attack or death from cardiovascular disease. Of them 396 were taking vitamin D supplements daily; the placebo group had 409 cases of a major cardiovascular event. The researchers concluded that the difference is too small and says there is no link between vitamin D and a lowered risk of major cardiovascular events or invasive cancers.Anastasia Z. Kalea senior lecturer at the Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics at University College London who was not part of the study said the results are "very important but not surprising." Both conclusions were suspected and the trial supports them she added.The study shows that it is not possible for vitamin D supplements to prevent cancer and the differences in the placebo and vitamin D groups are minimal Kalea said.However over the course of the study deaths from cancer were significantly reduced by 25% for those who took vitamin D supplements. This finding needs further research but Manson thinks it can be explained with vitamin D affecting tumor biology making it less likely that the tumor grows and spreads. Recent research also disproved the theory that vitamin D improves bone health and prevents fractures but some experts disagree with this citing small time periods and sample sizes as well as insufficient dosages.Some benefit from omega-3In the omega-3 analysis invasive cancers were found in 820 participants taking daily supplements of 1 gram of omega-3 and in 797 who received a placebo. Also 386 people taking 1 gram of omega-3 experienced cardiovascular events during the study as did 419 people taking a placebo. But for heart attacks specifically findings showed an overall 28% reduction in those taking omega-3 supplements. For African-Americans the study found a 77% reduction in heart attacks linked to daily of omega-3 supplements. In people who don't eat the recommended one or two servings of fish a week the supplements were linked to a 40% reduction in heart attacks. But for people who followed the recommendation there was no such association.Manson recommends trying to get omega-3 from a healthy diet that incorporates fish. But people who don't eat or don't like fish should talk to a health care professional about the option of omega-3 supplements.  "It could be a chance finding" Manson said and thus it needs to be replicated. But if confirmed this could point to a "promising approach to reducing health disparity."Nathan Davies lead for the Clinical Nutrition and Public Health program at University College London said these findings are not "radical findings by any means. There could be benefits there but they are not as clear-cut." The findings show that omega-3 oils are not harmful added Davies who was not involved in the research. However he noted that the study could have benefited from longer duration. "You always want an even longer duration especially if you are looking at cancer."It also doesn't analyze whether there is a dose dependency effect and a higher dose could lead to better results Davies said."Diet is more important than supplementation. If you have a good diet you won't need supplements" he said adding that this is not always practical as factors such as income and availability can also affect diet. Victoria Taylor senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation wrote in an email "We don't recommend taking vitamin and mineral supplements to prevent heart and circulatory disease and this study's findings support our advice."If you eat a healthy balanced Mediterranean style diet you should be able to get all the nutrients that you need to protect you from heart and circulatory diseases" she added.,Health
 (CNN)For 10 years some residents in Denmark South Carolina have been suspicious of the rust-colored water coming from their taps. They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.But through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.The state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance known as HaloSan was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.The city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city. The EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope. It's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3000 people who live in this rural tight-knit community but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from. The chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.One thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use and it should not have. It was used for 10 years. CNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.A spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was "advertised.""The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... " said Tommy Crosby director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.Berry Systems the makers of HaloSan has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment. "It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used" said Gerald Wright mayor of Denmark South Carolina.  "We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test monitor and advise."An EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water."HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and therefore EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water" according to the EPA. An EPA risk assessment from 2007 Disinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program. The EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law "a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product "can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment." The EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered. Wright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC. "The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how or if the standard for daily monitoring was met. Marc Edwards a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark said he was "dumbfounded" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells."I did a thorough search and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before" he said. "And the EPA approvals that I saw none of them were for municipal potable water."In addition Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated."You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose" he said. "There's a maximum allowed amount even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that that level is not being exceeded." Wilma Subra a chemist and environmental health scientist told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring "performed by the certified system operator" of "any chemical" added to the drinking water ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.Joe Charbonnet science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute said without knowing the concentration levels in the water it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.Like many small towns Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at even if the discolored water isn't violating the law. A $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough according to Wright Denmark's mayor. "[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first" he told CNN. "At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do." Water is a problem in thousands of towns across the United States. But in Denmark it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.Denmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years although a link has not been made directly to the water.Brown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink."How can they say it's good to drink?" Smith told CNN. "I'm not gonna drink it and I know other people drink it but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice." The couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook drink and brush their teeth.In 2016 Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television talking about the lead crisis in Flint Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal state and local governments on water quality and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water. Brown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark too.Edwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled.  But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.However medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body. South Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010 and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later it found levels had dropped below the legal limit. But in 2011 Eugene Smith was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high and he should avoid his own water.  "They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN. "I was shocked" Smith said. "Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time."Documents from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water he suspects it.But Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing especially after finding red flags like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright Denmark's mayor later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.Skeptical of the town's transparency Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.Wright wavered and eventually Edwards says he was denied access to the wells. Wright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing."I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples" he told CNN. "I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me."Instead the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells. After Edwards began asking questions the state was ordered by Clemson University which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use. "I mean it has stopped but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?" Eugene Smith said. "I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god."Denmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe."I live here" he said. "I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water." A group of about 40 residents including Smith and Brown are now considering litigation claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston South Carolina attorney John Harrell to represent them.   Harrell tells CNN one of his clients a 12-year-old had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4000 stones in it and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed. "There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination" he said. South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control when asked about the potential litigation said it would be "inappropriate" to comment.CNN's Matt Gannon contributed to this report Correction: ,Health
 (CNN)A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge researchers have said. The test which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL) who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.A group of almost 3200 patients aged 58-74 had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002 before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years from 2002 to 2016. People with the most intense pulses which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions the research found because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels. Pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer "cushion" the blood flow coming from the heart."If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle" said Dr. Scott Chiesa post-doctoral researcher at UCL."What's good for the arteries is good for the brain" he added in summary of his findings. "Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline."If the findings are confirmed by larger studies they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.And the scans would be "well set up for routine testing" according to Chiesa. "It's very easy to do and it's very quick to do."When healthy arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.But damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study. "What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia" said Carol Routledge Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK who was not involved in the research. Vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia. Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.Around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide according to the World Health Organization with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.  In the United States the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death according to the Office for National Statistics.'Promising findings'The study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations."Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development" said Paul Edwards Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.But he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis saying: "The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia." There is currently no cure for dementia though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms."Often a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next."Previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level but its effects remain largely incurable. More research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia."While these findings are interesting as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be" said Routledge.Routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking only consuming alcohol within recommended limits staying active monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.,Health
 (CNN)Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage. This time though the barbs over social media came from the medical community in response to a tweet from the National Rifle Association.The piling-on began after the NRA tweeted on Wednesday a link to an article from its Institute of Legislative Action. The article titled "Surprise: Physician Group Rehashes Same Tired Gun Control Policies" was promoted with these words: "Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. Half of the articles in Annals of Internal Medicine are pushing for gun control. Most upsetting however the medical community seems to have consulted NO ONE but themselves."The tweet went out hours before a gunman walked into the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks California and killed at least 12 people before turning his gun on himself. The NRA's tweet had more than 1300 likes by mid-Thursday. But it also riled up people inside and outside the medical field who replied by the thousands. "Oh was I supposed to consult the NRA when my elderly patient with dementia accidentally shot themself holstering a gun they legally owned?" @DrMFraggle asked. "Because I was under the impression I was to consult general surgery and social services. My bad. :/ Gun control: not just about young people.""After treating countless patients with life altering spinal cord injuries and brain injuries secondary to gun shot wounds I would have to say this is my lane" @DanaBussing wrote."Next time I have 16yo boy shot through the spine and liver paralyzed and terrified gasping for air and have to pretend to reassure him that we will do our best as he only survives long enough to make it to the OR table I'll be sure to call you to come tell the family" @tnicholsmd said."I helped save a gun violence victim in med school. Those are my hands holding pressure on his femoral artery so that he wouldn't bleed to death. The bullet is right by my fingertips. This is me in #mylane @NRA" @nurielmoghavem tweeted accompanied by an X-ray image of a patient's torso."i've reviewed the literature" @kyblot wrote "and there are basically no studies on the therapeutic benefits of getting shot."What drove the NRA's criticism: a recent article in Annals of Internal Medicine a leading academic medical journal coincidentally published in late October in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings and the killing of two African-Americans in a Kentucky Kroger store. In the article the American College of Physicians shared new recommendations on how doctors can play a role in reducing gun violence across the country. The medical association has long maintained that firearm-related deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis.The recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety. The argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic known as SAFE  are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement "evidence-based policy" on guns.A spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments."The so-called 'uproar' on twitter or what could [be] characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet. It's clear form the comments that they didn't read the article" Jennifer Baker wrote in an email. "It's just another example of gun control advocates with the help of the mainstream media blaming law abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of deranged people and exploiting tragedy to push a gun control agenda that would not prevent these crimes. The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent [last night's] tragedy."Baker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided. If medical organizations "would like to concentrate on a public health crisis" she wrote "they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly 50000 suicides per year the medical community's complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over 42000 lives per year or the  250000 deaths due to medical errors." Few NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors nurses and others.But some stepped onto the field like @wickedgrin1 who said "This is a crime issue not a public health issue. Doctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue to be corrected by government interference in private lives. This is the opposite of what medicine should be and there is not end to it."And there won't be an end to it until doctors are satisfied said Bob Doherty an official with the American College of Physicians."Here's a link to the @AnnalsofIM paper we wrote that has the @NRA demanding that doctors not speak out on gun violence" he tweeted. "Doctors will keep speaking out. Until the carnage ends. #GunViolence #GunSense"CNN's Jacqueline Howard and Arman Azad contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)Free from the constraints she might have felt while living in the White House former first lady Michelle Obama is getting personal opening herself up to the world in bold ways in her memoir "Becoming" out Tuesday. One piece of her journey that she delves into: the struggles she faced with infertility a subject that so often remains in the shadows. She shared details about how she had a miscarriage and relied on in vitro fertilization to conceive her two girls according to the Washington Post which received an advance copy of the book. She also revealed how she was left to give herself the necessary shots when her husband was off fulfilling his duties in the state Legislature."I felt lost and alone and I felt like I failed" she told Robin Roberts in an interview that ran Friday on "Good Morning America." "I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them. We sit in our own pain thinking that somehow we're broken."What Obama articulates is "so universal not just throughout the US but around the world" says Dr. Zev Williams director of the Columbia University Fertility Center. "There's a real sense of self-blame and guilt and a reluctance to discuss it with other people."Williams co-authored a 2015 study looking into public perceptions of miscarriage. Even though he says miscarriage or pregnancy loss occurs in at least 20% of all pregnancies 55% of those who responded to his survey thought miscarriage was rare occurring in 5% or less of pregnancies and some believed that they occur "in under 0.1% of pregnancies" he said.Not only are miscarriages common they are "in almost all cases" not the mother's fault Williams added. The fact that this sort of information isn't widely known only makes matters worse. "Of those who had a miscarriage 37% felt they had a lost a child 47% felt guilty 41% reported feeling that they had done something wrong 41% felt alone and 28% felt ashamed" the study reported.Obama has revealed that she's no different from other women who've suffered in silence. And the fact that she is speaking out today is significant Williams said."This happened 20 years ago and she's talking about it now which really reflects the emotional impact it had on her as it's had on many others" he said. In sharing this part of herself Obama told Roberts she hopes to help change the conversation. "The biological clock is real" Obama said. "I think it's the worst thing that we do to each other as women not share the truth about our bodies and how they work and how they don't work." Putting her high-profile name and face on this topic will serve to help not just those who've been there themselves but also those who could be more understanding and sensitive. "For those who have gone through pregnancy loss they will get a sense of comfort in seeing that they are not alone in the world" and a sense of hope in knowing that Obama was able to go on to have two children Williams said. And for those who've been spared this sort of struggle he added Obama's story can be "eye-opening and perhaps help people be a little more careful with their words." ,Health
 (CNN)The woman had used oxycodone for almost a decade but told her doctors she had been sober for two years. She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy she said and had completed rehab.But her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs but why?Amid an opioid epidemic the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead they said the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.'A false sense of safety'According to a case report published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.The plant which is native to Southeast Asia is typically used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs it is hailed by some as a solution to the opioid epidemic but derided by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug. The mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep."I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative" said Dr. Whitney Eldridge a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report. The mother might have been well-intentioned but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications the boy was discharged to his parents.It's rare but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that "this case is not unique." He said the FDA "is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery." Gottlieb whose agency has issued a variety of warnings on kratom called the new report "a tragic case of harm" and said it "further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom including the potential for abuse and addiction."And though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom she believes that physicians today "need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn."Experts urge caution cast doubt Some experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms."I'm not surprised that this is possible" said Dr. Andrew Kruegel an associate research scientist at Columbia University "because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users especially at higher doses."But Kruegel who has studied the plant for seven years noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. "The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking" he said. "Without that information you can't really extrapolate too much."And the mother might not have been taking kratom at all said Dr. Edward W. Boyer an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital."It's the husband who reported the kratom use" he said. "The wife who actually ingested the product who thought it was kratom and the authors of the case report itself none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom."Kratom's rocky past and uncertain futureDespite the FDA's warnings kratom is easy to buy and is sometimes sold as a tea in cafés. The nonprofit American Kratom Association estimates that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products."We believe that as in many supplements there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this" Dave Herman the association's chairman said. "That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure."Kratom acts on opioid receptors which the FDA says is evidence of its potential for abuse. The agency points to 44 deaths associated with kratom but Kruegel said that "if you look at those 44 deaths the vast majority of them involve other substances including other strong opioids."Boyer said kratom may have other risks such as seizures but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because "there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone." Respiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction steering users away from more dangerous drugs."If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy" Boyer said.Challenges to developing kratom-based drugsThe American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug especially because they can't patent the raw plant."If I'm a drug company I think that it costs somewhere depending on who you speak to between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market" Herman said. "Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat ride down a river and grab it off a tree?"Because kratom is considered a dietary supplement manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms. But some companies have done just that drawing the FDA's ire for saying their products could "relieve opioid withdrawal" or "treat a myriad of ailments." The association says those cases are anomalies."The reality is our belief is this is America" Herman said. "And if a product is useful for your health and well-being you should have the right to take it as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm."The FDA however continues to warn against kratom even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic."Kratom has never been studied in humans" Gottlieb said in the statement. "What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead as the FDA has warned kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis.",Health
 (CNN)When Simon Kindleysides crossed the finish line at the Virgin Money London Marathon this year what followed was a blur -- but he became a "superhero" to his kids and he set a world record in becoming the first paralyzed man to complete the race on foot.He was the final finisher.When David Fraser crossed the finish line at the TCS New York City Marathon last year it marked his 10th time completing that race using his toes to push his wheelchair to the finish line.He was the final finisher.When Amina Abdul-Jalil crossed the finish line this year at an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race she never felt more proud. She accomplished something she didn't think she could with asthma but because of her history of depression running has been a "lifesaver."She was the final finisher.Lisa Jackson has run 110 marathons and ultramarathons around the world. After each she has a tradition of sleeping with the new medal around her neck to celebrate her accomplishment.In 25 of those races she was the final finisher -- and she revels in coming in last.The world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance Olympic medalist Shalane Flanagan broke the finish line tape at the New York City Marathon last year becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.Yet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia director of the New York City Marathon puts it "for every runner there's a story.""They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train" he said. "Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring from the first to the final finish." On average it takes bout 4½ hours for men and women to complete a marathon Ciaccia said but that time can vary drastically among racers.In honor of Sunday's New York City Marathon where more than 50000 people traveled through the five boroughs here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.One thing they have in common: They never gave up.'Even when I was able-bodied I took plenty for granted'As Simon Kindleysides 34 took his first steps in the London Marathon in April it felt as if magic was in the air. "As we were walking toward the first mile we actually started blending in with all the runners" he said. "Everyone was on the streets cheering and that was a magical moment."As time went on the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking. Kindleysides who is paralyzed from the waist down and typically uses a wheelchair was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving."I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery" he said.In 2013 Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.Before his paralysis the London-based singer and dancer had "always wanted to run a marathon" he said but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year."Even when I was able-bodied I took plenty for granted" Kindleysides said. "You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on."During the London Marathon the last two miles were the hardest."At that point I was exhausted. It was freezing cold and I was hurting and emotional" Kindleysides said but he kept going."I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us and I was raising money for The Brain Tumour Charity" he said. "I didn't want to let them down myself down and I thought if I'd get this far I'd have to continue."So he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.Once Kindleysides crossed the finish line a live news crew interviewed him and "I said 'I need a full body massage and a Jägerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking" he said. "My brain went mashed potato."Then recovering at home he shared his accomplishment with his three children."I was called RoboCop Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine" Simon said."They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair and now they say I'm their dad the only one who has walked a marathon" he said. "It was amazing emotional just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't."Kindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year including the London Marathon again.Meanwhile a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.'Every year I run the race for my wife'David Fraser who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment. Fraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does."My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year and they couldn't believe I was the last one because I had done many races. I had done 5K I had done half-marathons I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that" said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called Nightwarriors Fitness."But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it" he said of his family. "At the start of every marathon I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race."Cerebral palsy a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.Before 2007 he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding but that year his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race. He has set out to finish it every year since."That next year 2008 my wife developed stomach cancer and now every year I run the race for my wife" said Fraser whose wife still attends his races.He even developed a strategy: "Ninety percent of the race I do backwards" he said. "Because when I go downhill I go forward but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain I go backwards. ... I always run that way."Overall Fraser said "The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done really done you now have to talk yourself back into it."Fraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday and he's looking forward to the race."All runners are out of their minds" he joked. "Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it."As for one runner in Atlanta not only does she love it it has been a "lifesaver."'There's nothing I would change'Amina Abdul-Jalil started running last year around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer."I realized in that time I don't think it was even the whole month that I had gained 10 pounds and I was just stressed and I thought 'I need to do something now or this isn't going to end well' " Abdul-Jalil said.So she joined a running group called Black Girls Run. "To be completely honest it's been a lifesaver in a very real way because I have major depressive disorder" she said.Regular exercise such as running can help curb symptoms of depression something that Abdul-Jalil said she noticed firsthand.As she continued running with the group an opportunity arose to join in an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race but Abdul-Jalil was hesitant. Then she saw a video clip of ultramarathon runner Mirna Valerio a runner with a body type similar to her own."I was like 'she runs like me' -- and that was a big moment for me" Abdul-Jalil said. "So I was like 'maybe maybe maybe I could pull this off.' "Then she registered for The Race and trained for 12 weeks.Abdul-Jalil and I both ran that half-marathon last month. Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it."Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma" said the 41-year-old mother who lives in the Atlanta area."And I'm not FloJo-built" she added referencing late track-and-field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.Over the 13.1-mile course Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' "Ride" and Outkast's "B.O.B."Around mile three a medical director approached her indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it the medical director said.In that moment Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged."I wanted to cry and quit and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head" she said. To keep her going she thought about the running group Black Girls Run."I literally went back to conversations that I've had" she said. "Every time I said I can't do something there was at least one or two other people that said I could."So she kept going."By the last two miles it was just me" Abdul-Jalil said.Then during the last mile a race administrator and volunteer met her on the course and ran with her to the finish. They even posted a live video of her finish on Facebook to celebrate her as the last runner.A couple of days later Abdul-Jalil watched the video which has gotten more than 2000 views.With her depression Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish "that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart" she said. "There's nothing I would change."Before the race "I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh my God what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again" she said. "You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated. It's validating."Being the final finisher is something that one runner in London not only would do again but has done 25 times.'It's not about the time you do but the time you have'Lisa Jackson loves being the last runner."I think it's a special place in the race" said the London-based author of the book "Your Pace or Mine? What Running Taught Me About Life Laughter and Coming Last.""When you're last it's a sense of occasion. People really admire you for your grit when getting there" she said.Jackson 51 was "incredibly unathletic" as a child and ran her first marathon when she was 31."After the indescribable feeling of accomplishment and joy I thought 'I have to experience this feeling every year at least once' " she said and so she set out to run at least one marathon annually."When I first started running my biggest fear was coming last" Jackson said. "And it was actually my 31st marathon -- the South Downs Marathon -- when I was the final finisher for the first time."Jackson ran the South Downs trail marathon in the UK in June 2012. The course was hilly the summer heat was grueling and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.Jackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course she said. They spoke as she continued on her way and she made a friend.Next thing she knew she was approaching the finish line where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation."I no longer have any fear of coming last and if there's a risk of coming second to last I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line" Jackson said.After all in that moment on the South Downs she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile."My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have" said Jackson who went on to run the New York Boston London Chicago and Rome marathons among dozens of others."I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ... I think 'well how many races have you run?' " she joked."When you do something that is not easy and you think you're not cut out for and you succeed at it it gives you so much courage in other aspects of your life" she said. "Running is really the most life-affirming energizing thing you can do. Don't let the fear of coming last put you off. Every race needs a winner and a loser and it might as well be you.",Health
 (CNN)Two physicians who lost their young son to the flu last year want parents to listen to their message born of great grief and suffering: Get your child a flu shot. Drs. Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son Leon did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick. "I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy" said Laura a psychiatrist. "This has been a hard haul for us and we're very private people but we're trying to help other families."Leon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a historic high. Approximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot according to the CDC. Laura and Anthony a rheumatologist had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas where state law prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.The couple busy with their newborn third child Cameron decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit scheduled for January 3. Leon died 10 days before that appointment. "It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really really needed to prioritize" Laura said.  "It just slipped through the cracks." The Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Muñoz. For 20 years Muñoz a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children. The rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year according to the CDC which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot. The problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work children don't have as many options. In most states there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule. Only 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age according to the National Association of State Pharmacy Associations. "It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn" Muñoz said. There's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy said Muñoz who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.Some states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year after the historic flu season the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older. "Good for you New York!" Muñoz said. "More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push." Dr. William Schaffner an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics. Right now he said it's difficult for those departments to purchase large quantities of vaccine and to bill insurance. "We need to do more to make it easy" he said. The Sidaris are doing their part. Last month they sponsored a "Say Boo to the Flu" event in their hometown Albion New York where 59 children were vaccinated. Although the CDC encourages flu vaccines by the end of October each year it's especially important to get the shot well before the holidays Muñoz said. Flu activity can peak in December and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it. "Leon is my reason this season and every season for getting flu shots on time" Laura Sidari wrote on her Facebook page. "Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait but the flu shot cannot." CNN's John Bonifield and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this story. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated where the Sidaris lived last year. ,Health
 (CNN)John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too and she knew something had gone terribly wrong."I told myself that this can't be happening" Joanne said. "I'm putting two and two together and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts and I'm frantic my mind is running."John now 19 had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew. When the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked "John can you take off your shirt?" What she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before requiring additional surgeries to repair but this was different. "They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back" she remembers.Within a few weeks John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all and the recovery was grueling. "Every 15 minutes" Joanne said "the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?'" "I can't do this anymore" John told his mom ripping off his pulse oximeter. "I want to go home."A lifetime of struggleWhen he was 6 years old John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day taking it off only to shower. His mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school John felt different. "I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on" he said. "It was just so annoying."Scoliosis the curving of the spine from side to side affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.But for all its inconvenience the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery doctors said and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.But after 17 operations those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever. "It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot" said Dr. Jeffrey Wang president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. "But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails."John's surgeon unable to treat him any further recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society. "Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of" said Lenke. "Some surgeons at some point are not comfortable treating these conditions."  'How do I trust you?'John's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to NewYork-Presbyterian a month later Lenke said that John was "bending by the hour." Joanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations."She was a little terrified of any more surgeries" Lenke said "because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'Indeed Joanne remembers "I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option and the surgery had to be done."John's kyphosis an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back was so severe that it impacted his breathing leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. "Walking through school even from one end to the other I'd be out of breath" John remembered. "It was definitely a struggle."He needed surgery but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life. Called a vertebral column resection Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together."It does work well" Lenke said "but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord and that's risky." His mother was terrified but John had few options."The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die" Lenke said "and she could see that slowly happening."A moment of terror before 'a new chance at life'The surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan."We test electrical activity" Lenke said "and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out the spinal cord activity went away." That isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but "for an hour he was technically paralyzed." Lenke powered through the surgery working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord and John emerged from the operation with no complications. "The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom" said Joanne. "They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working and they saved my son's life."The top of John's spine had been bent forward over 120 degrees before his surgery making it difficult to stand straight up and perform daily tasks like walking up stairs."I was collapsing on myself" John said. His operation was so drastic that it changed his body's center of gravity."Those first steps leaning up against the bed I felt like I was in a new body" John said. "It's a pretty crazy feeling and I still remember it today. It was almost like learning how to walk again."It was his 18th surgery but things felt different this time. "This might be a chance at a new life" he remembers thinking. "I could feel myself getting stronger with each step."From the operating room to the golf courseA year later John graduated high school and attended his senior prom. "I was just praying everyday for a miracle to happen that I would be able to see my son graduate" said Joanne. When it finally happened earlier this year "it was a beautiful day" she said.John is now seven inches taller and regularly plays basketball and golf activities that were unthinkable before his surgery. He's learning how to drive too and is currently a student at Nassau Community College on Long Island.He isn't sure exactly what he wants to do when he graduates but John dreams of being a doctor."Since I was helped as a child I want to help children as they're growing up and dealing with their own situations" he said. And while he isn't picking up the scalpel just yet John has some advice for those who might be struggling like he did."If you just stay positive" he said "and work through and deal with the pain of the situation if you can just get through that then there are going to be brighter days."Davide Cannaviccio contributed to this story.,Health
Homosassa Florida (CNN)Kelly Thomas inches across the soft grass using a walker to navigate her way. Each step is exhilarating and exhausting. She pauses amid the 90-degree Florida heat and smiles. "It only takes a little bit of try -- and by a little I mean a lot" she says.Thomas 24 is one of three paralyzed patients who can now walk again thanks to a stimulation device implanted in her lower back coupled with intense physical therapy. News of the patients' progress -- considered an important medical advancement -- was published in separate studies in two scientific journals on Monday. On a recent sunny day Thomas returned to the spot that took so much from her on July 19 2014. It's where the truck she was driving came to a halt after flipping four times around a bend on Halls River Road and smashing into a tree. Her body was motionless hanging halfway out of the mangled wreckage. She was blue and getting cold.She has driven past the scene of the crash many times since then to try to jar her memory. To help remember what happened that night. To piece together the moment that changed everything. Nothing seems to work.Visiting this time she walks toward the tree talking to her legs to motivate them to keep moving. "One foot in front of the other" she says. "Slowly but surely."At 5 feet 1 inch tall she is a spitfire of inspiration. Her grit shows immediately not just from when she walks but also when she talks.  "Paralysis isn't in my dictionary." "Don't call me handicapped because I'm not.""Thank God I was raised cowboy tough."It takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories. "I tell you what" she says. "It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended."She woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19 she was paralyzed from the chest down.She told her neurosurgeon she would walk again no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to "go chasing something that's never going to happen."The journey has been in no way easy. There were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation she would say to God "I don't know why this has happened but if you can help me to understand this it might make it a little easier." She had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up. The trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met. As she stands next to the tree Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. "It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible" she says. "Somewhere between possible and impossible."Being here gives me a sense of power because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have."Transforming the spinal cord injury fieldThomas is part of innovative research conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville. In a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine two of four patients with "motor complete spinal cord injury" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers. "This should change our thinking about people with paralysis" said Susan Harkema one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. "It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries."Claudia Angeli the other lead researcher and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs. "It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy" Angeli said.Over the years their research has involved 14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. All 14 patients have experienced voluntarily movement with the implant the researchers said. They  also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.The latest study focused on four patients including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months.  A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 months after receiving the implant. All four were able to stand independently and two were able to walk over ground the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip setting his therapy back by several months the researchers said.The other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. "With the stimulator off" Angeli said "he can't even sit up."Harkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment. Harkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations according to a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016. The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work. What's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again? "I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program" Harkema said. "They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers."Adding to the excitement of these advancements another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California Los Angeles."What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis" Dr. Kendall Lee the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories said in a press release.There have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked. One study in 2015 and another in 2016 showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called "brain-computer interface" in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity allowing some patients to walk."They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system but the overall outcome is similar" said Monica Perez a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami. Monday's studies Perez said provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that "can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing." "What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited even though you have an injury from years ago" said Perez who was not connected to either study. From a scientific point of view she said an important consequence of the studies is the awareness "that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections" she said. "These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.""It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist" she said. "But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated."Harkema and Angeli whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program. For Thomas it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through. "Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life because I took something that was thought to be impossible and I turned it into possible" she says.'Way too many things to do'Since she was a child Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos she and Shadow were inseparable. "All you need is love and a horse" the motto next to her bed says.In her late teens she would run 3 to 4 miles a day train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist. All of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.Not only had she lost her ability to walk she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence she felt had been stripped. "I was lying there saying 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life' " she says. "I have way too many things to do."To walk again she'd have to "cowboy up" as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch. It would push her to the limits at times leaving her on the floor crying wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy working on standing and stepping for an hour every day. The stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant but at the time no one had walked. She thought "what's the point of going through so much work?""Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes" she says "was not enough for me."One of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder "what if" for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.  On August 5 2017 the family's vehicle was loaded up. "Are we going?" her father asked. They drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month. Sensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on."There was this rushing vibration" she says. "It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild."The real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success she says but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week a couple of hours every day.She clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions repeating phrases to herself: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" and "God is with me. I will not fail.""I tell you what: After the implant I was introduced to a whole new ballgame" she says. "The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions just to get me through because I wanted to quit."The stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves allowing her to consciously control the movement. It began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.She was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase "No Days Off" on that magical day in February. She took a step or two and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. "Oh my God" Thomas said. She wiped away the tears and took more steps. It was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs body and mind.  "Trying to trust my body trying to find a cadence was very hard."Finding her callingThomas can now walk and talk at the same time but she still must focus on each step.She presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. "I'm still paralyzed as can be without it" she says. When she stands she asks herself "How do I walk again?"Beyond helping her walk the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. "I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it" she says.Strolling across her front lawn at the family ranch she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again. She points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again. "That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed" she says. For now she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard. In town that encouragement is on full display."I just want to tell you congratulations sweetie. You're doing beautiful" a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.A man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. "Need some help?" he asks."No sir" she responds. "I've got it."She exemplifies a fierce determination like few others. Through her struggle she's found her calling.  Being around her one can't help but be inspired. She rattles off an array of powerful messages. "Even if I can't physically help people like I initially intended to do I can dang sure encourage help and motivate.""I carry on with my life like nobody's business even if my legs aren't working so great.""The stimulator is facilitating my movement but my strength is coming from within."That strength is what's gotten her this far. Her 19-year-old brother Sam sums it up in cowboy speak: "There's nothing she can't do. That's for sure."He lifts his sister onto Shadow. Kelly and Shadow trot around the front yard. She doesn't know when but she says one day she'll hop on without her brother's help."I don't have a time frame" she says "but I have physical goals to get me there."The moral of her story she says is never underestimate a cowboy.CNN's John Bonifield and Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report,Health
 (CNN)For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time. In Oklahoma a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction those years were the heyday of the "shake and bake" method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.The technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth but with one tiny misstep the chemical reaction that occurs inside can cause deadly explosions.By 2011 Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city. "People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine" he said. "It was a really horrible time."When new laws were enacted to limit access to pseudoephedrine -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011 his department encountered just 19 last year.But Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before with most of it coming from south of the border.And while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.The role of Mexican 'superlabs'Richard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.He said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.As it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void."They came in with much purer much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country" Salter said.Salter said in 2012 the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1100 an ounce. Today his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450."That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career" he said.The reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas "shake and bake" labs could turn out lots of small batches so-called "superlabs" in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.Salter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.Along the border officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.Anne Maricich deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year."The other hard narcotics like cocaine heroin and fentanyl we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth" she said.On the streets of Oklahoma this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.The number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017 there were 327 meth overdose deaths but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher according to Mark Woodward spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics."There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis" said Woodward. "But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine."Perhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.In just the first six months of 2018 Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds. He can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution. Wollmershauser said his department is trying to use more "front end diversion" tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.While the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year. "I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens but the addiction is strong and it's difficult" Wollmershauser said.How meth fueled a crisis behind barsLindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.At age 14 her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth. "I immediately liked it" McAteer said. "It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment." It was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.After using meth for several years she said she stopped for a brief period but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on her addiction spiraled out of control."I had nothing" McAteer said. "I was losing everything and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK despite the fact that nothing was OK."In addition to using meth McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.Mass incarceration is also an issue in Oklahoma -- particularly among women -- and lengthy sentences for drug offenses are a major contributing factor according to analysis by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. The state has the nation's highest female incarceration rate with 149 out of every 100000 women locked up more than double the national average. But even for those like McAteer who face time in prison there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. Women in Recovery or WIR is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.With the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.Mimi Tarrasch the executive senior director for WIR said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth."Early on because it's a stimulant they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated" said Roxanne Hinther clinical director for WIR. "But ultimately they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have."Tarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.Using a range of treatments training and education the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.McAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.Since Women in Recovery began in 2009 390 women have graduated with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity."I can say that recovery is definitely possible and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment" McAteer said. "It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work but the vast majority of us do.",Health
This story contains graphic language.  (CNN)Her Catholic boyfriend said he was waiting until marriage to have sex so she felt safe. But after she passed out fully clothed on prom night she woke up naked with him on top of and inside her. She got pregnant that night 36 years ago and he paid for her abortion. Then he mailed a letter to tell her she was going to hell.Five drunken frat boys piled on top of a college sophomore who was sober as the party's loud music drowned out her screams in the dark room. They grabbed at and groped her. One of them penetrated her with his finger before she broke free and ran. A 19-year-old studying abroad woke up to a young man fondling her and masturbating in her face. An older boy plied a 15-year-old with booze and after she passed out at a house party stole her virginity. Another young woman took the cocktail a cute guy offered on her 21st birthday. She didn't know what to call it when the same guy had his way with her after she grew woozy they left the bar and her body went numb. More than a decade later when a friend of friends assaulted her dislocated her jaw and left her bruised she knew the word: rape. These are just a sampling of the dozens of stories of sexual assault that were shared with me in recent days by phone email and through social media. They are accounts from women in their 30s 40s and 50s who I asked to reflect on their younger years mostly in high school and college. They spoke out on the condition that they and the accused would remain anonymous.Some called their sexual assaults a "cliché" perhaps too common to be worth mentioning. One woman simply quipped "Is there a woman who made it through college without this experience?"With decades-old allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Brett Kavanaugh making headlines and threatening to derail his Supreme Court nomination we've entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Women are thinking back to their own experiences many of them for the first time in years. They're talking about their assaults online in their homes and at dinner parties. What are these stories stirring up in women? Are they putting themselves in the shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers? And do they think they could or would come forward themselves if the men who assaulted them were suddenly poised for positions of power?  'Every scream I never screamed'Plenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few if they knew who their attackers were reported anything to authorities or other adults including parents. Those who did learned quickly why most girls and women don't. They weren't believed felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the "boys will be boys" line even by their mothers.  Some had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.There were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to "feel like a slut." The last time she was assaulted she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch."At first I froze but then I started to scream" she said. "I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed." They were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know and ones they were fixed up with knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the "golden boy" in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.A fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members."Until their parents die until they move away and I never have to see their face again until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women" she wrote in a social media post.  To come forward about these men before then wouldn't be "worth the headache" she said. But "if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes."'Bookend to Brock Turner'For some this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a "bookend to Brock Turner" a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who in January 2015 was caught on campus outside a fraternity sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three. One woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won. "I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office which meant that it was okay to assault women" she wrote.The growing activism of women give many of them hope even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.  "The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for" one woman said. They want to think though that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.If they could talk to their younger selves they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.Their own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones sons and daughters learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies. Some have told their older kids what happened to them while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant. One woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.'A skeleton' in his closetThey question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.There are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and even after all these years worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it they'd be as brave."The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward" one woman wrote in an email. "We can't all be liars."A few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them. They've monitored their lives and careers. One woman decided timed with the 30th anniversary of her assault to send the now-family man a letter. She never expected to hear from him -- and she didn't. She did it for herself. By putting words to what she's lived with all these years she felt better.At one point the prom date who once vowed he was waiting until marriage to have sex and then paid for an abortion after he raped his date held a job in a state attorney's office. "I remember back then wondering what I would do if I learned he was running for public office. It seemed plausible that he would" the woman said. "I wondered if he considered me and my abortion a skeleton in his Republican closet."Just days after she first typed #MeToo on her Facebook page last year even though they had no friends in common he sent her a Facebook friend request. It was the first contact he'd made with her since he'd written 35 years earlier to tell her she was going to hell. It felt a bit like "a litmus test" she said. Would her accepting in his mind mean he was safe?She waited a few days and then accepted. She did it not because she was letting him off the hook. She accepted because she wanted him to see her every post to know how strong she is. ,Health
 (CNN)"Jingle Bells" played on radios across Ohio. The local mall plastered "Merry Christmas" on its digital signs. And hundreds of people in 90-degree weather wore Santa hats as they caroled in front of one little boy's home. It's only September but for a 2-year-old with terminal brain cancer Christmas came early this year.Colerain Township a suburb of Cincinnati celebrated the holiday this weekend because doctors say the boy Brody Allen wouldn't make it to December. Despite aggressive and painful chemotherapy brain scans showed that Brody's five embryonal tumors were not responding to treatment. "The doctor had tears in his eyes as he was telling us" said his aunt Dina Brock. "The poor boy had gone through so much in the hospital but there wasn't any good news."After Brody spent more than 90 days at Cincinnati Children's Hospital much of it in the intensive care unit the Allen family decided to bring him home. Painful radiation therapy would do little for his prognosis doctors told the family and "we wanted to do everything we could to let him live life" said Brock."He can't use the left side of his body his speech has changed and he has tremors" she said. But back at home "he doesn't get down about it. He doesn't know what we know. He doesn't know he has cancer."'Team Brody' goes viralThe family started a Facebook group "Team Brody" to update loved ones on his status. Hoping to celebrate the holidays one last time with their son the family made a post asking friends and family for Christmas lights.That small request went viral and more than 13000 people have since joined the group sending prayers from as far away as London and Paris. "The love and attention they're giving Brody is unbelievable" said Brock. "People are reaching out for no other reason than their good will."Back at home Brody's neighborhood soon turned into a winter wonderland. Inflatable snowmen lined the streets and garland hung from fences and front doors. Brody was the Grand Marshal of his own superhero-themed Christmas parade which featured Santa riding a firetruck cheerleaders and a dazzling fireworks display this past Sunday."When the parade started my family was in the front row to see it all" said Amanda Hill a Colerain Township resident who watched with her husband and twin children. "It was overwhelming and abundantly clear how much that little boy meant to the community."A town comes togetherIn divisive times Brody's story has brought family friends and even strangers together."This is a community of people with diverse backgrounds beliefs ethnicities and genders coming together for Brody" said Matt Castleman a pastor at the Crossroads West Side church outside of Cincinnati. Castleman who studied musical theater worked with local radio station WARM 98.5 to organize a flash mob on Saturday outside of Brody's home.The Children's Theatre of Cincinnati provided reindeer and elf costumes Castleman's church helped turn out singers and the station took photos. Volunteers handed out lyric sheets at a local grocery store before consolidating cars and heading to Brody's neighborhood where they distributed gifts and sang songs like "Silent Night" while holding hands."The Allen family knew that we were coming but they were shocked when we showed up with hundreds of people" Castleman said. It was so hot he added that "you couldn't tell if people were crying or sweating." The airwaves were blanketed with the holiday spirit too. "We decided to play one Christmas song per hour with a shout out to Brody before every song to help him celebrate with his family a little early" said Brian Demay the program director at WARM 98.5.'He definitely seems happier'That support has meant the world to Brody an outgoing boy who spent months in the ICU where he often wasn't allowed to see his brothers or sisters. "He definitely seems happier to me" said Brock. "He loves people and he's not afraid of anyone." "He's a flirt" she added. "He's a major flirt. He's flirting with any and everybody but mostly the ladies." And he has fans too. Supporters have been using the hashtag #TeamBrody to send support to members of the Allen family who have already raised more than $37000 through a GoFundMe created to cover Brody's medical expenses. The boy's father Todd Allen wrote on Facebook that "the world collectively has reached out to hug our son.""You have taught me that we are not bound together solely by our nationality language religion culture race social or economic status" he said. "We are bound by our humanity.",Health
Augusta Georgia (CNN)There's nothing sweet or adorable about the way newlyweds Brittany and Ryan Coleman first met -- no "meet cute" like in rom-com movies or romance novels.  It was 2015 and Brittany bought heroin from Ryan in a parking lot and Ryan cheated her. Brittany called him some choice names and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Despite that inauspicious beginning and the many years of drug abuse that preceded it the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction. They want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States. "You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out" said Brittany 29. Addiction rehab and relapseWhen Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old her parents divorced and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania. She struggled emotionally and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon pain pills became her drug of choice and by age 18 she was addicted. Ryan now 37 was born into a military family moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany he had a loving family but as a teenager he felt like he didn't fit in and he started to smoke pot at age 14. "I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high" he said. By the time Ryan was 17 he was smoking pot every day and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers. His father an Army drill sergeant and his mother a high school teacher begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for. By 22 he was strung out on heroin. "I had to have it" he said. Over the next 10 years Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city they both used heroin methamphetamines prescription opioids Xanax cocaine and alcohol.Brittany overdosed three times and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole too and had a stint at prostitution. Their parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse. By 2016 both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta Georgia. They happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot. A forbidden love (and with good reason) He's cute Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab. She's beautiful Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar. He realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal. "I thought 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off" Ryan remembered. "I did want to make amends but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her."Dating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why. As they fell in love they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly imperceptibly Ryan slipped away taking Brittany with him. After about four months of dating one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life. But instead he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.He called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send. It said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send. And everything fell apart. Giving up heroin -- and each otherFor the next week Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin right back to cocaine right back to meth sometimes all at the same time. "I even romanticized it saying f*** all the rules we're going to be heroin junkies together all that 'Trainspotting' bull****" he said referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. "Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use." Then on October 3 2016 they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom and Ryan right outside unconscious in his car.The medics gave them doses of Narcan the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses. Ryan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her. "I had almost killed the person I loved the most" he said. Brittany returned to Hope House a treatment center for women in Augusta. Ryan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors he got down on his knees -- and apologized. "He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people" Brittany said crying at the memory of it. "He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me." They then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month they had no contact at all. "The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery and not on each other" Brittany said. "It was the only way it would work." Brittany then left Hope House and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly and then a year and a half later on February 24 2018 they were married.Two years soberNext month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center helping others overcome their addictions. They volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan the drug that saved both of them so many times. When asked how they survived addiction where so many have died they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them. They also say they let other people guide them: their families who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive. All of those people joined them on their wedding day."It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together" Ryan said. Sometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive much less in a loving stable relationship. "It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human" she said. "I didn't ever picture that for myself." They want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics there can be hope. "I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out" Ryan said. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.,Health
 (CNN)Cystic fibrosis did not define Claire Wineland. She did.No matter the obstacles placed in front of her of which there were many she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people invited -- no demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile spunk and spirit.On Sunday evening after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.'Love what is'A quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.Her parents Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland split up when Claire was 3 but they remained friends and partners in her care.Her father credits Claire with teaching him "to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet" and to learn to "love what is."Yeager who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.In 2017 Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point Claire looked at her mom and said "After you die you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything" Yeager remembered.These words were a gift a reminder that Claire would remain with her always even after she was gone.Trusting ClaireMore than 30000 people in the United States more than 70000 worldwide have cystic fibrosis according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The median survival age is 40 the foundation reports which is a great improvement from the 1950s when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.The genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion affects the pancreas and other organs and eventually leads to respiratory failure.There is no cure but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant when successful can add years to a patient's life.Claire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care she knew her body best -- what worked for her what didn't and how far she was willing to go.So when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant they had to accept her decision even if it pained them."I had to be honest" she once explained. "It's not for me and never has been."A change of heartClaire took the gift of life and her health seriously but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited "cures" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.She was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be "another happy sick person book" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.At a TEDx talk she gave last year Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life."Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second" she said. "It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given." Claire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome albeit terrifying development for those who loved her.To get on the list for new lungs she had to be sick enough to need them yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.But Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes. Revealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up "Don't Panic" logo from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."She listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed."None of it spooked me" Claire said afterward. "Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything."'It's a GO!!!'In late May she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list temporarily. By mid-August she was back on and feeling ready.She'd worked hard to get there was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing upon doctor's orders would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.  She knew that the call could come at any minute and on August 26 it did."It's a GO!!!" she posted on Twitter not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. "See y'all on [the] other side."The nine-hour surgery went well and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room. But not long after the successful surgery hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries and what her mother described as "Herculean efforts" to try to save her the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully with her parents by her side. "They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last" Laura McHolm the board chair for Claire's foundation wrote in a Facebook post. Less than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge according to the United Network for Organ Sharing which operates the nation's organ transplant system.Claire who understood the importance of organ donation was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference. "Claire was able to save the life of two people her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. "Claire's gift is huge I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero."The family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease. 'Go enjoy it'In one of the last videos Claire posted she went where she hadn't before.A self-described "goofball" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more."It hurts everything inside of me to make this video" she said into the camera. "I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ... The years of telling myself I can do it on my own are over."She had plenty of emotional support but she worried what transplant surgery might mean for her future and her parents' future if it didn't go well. What if they poured everything into her transplant and she didn't make it or was not able to work again she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it she said she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.Before signing off Claire implored viewers to do one thing."Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously" she said with her signature smile and laugh her eyes not yet dry. "Go enjoy it 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it.",Health
Hong Kong (CNN)Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.It's summer on the island and at 8:30 in the morning the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit with an unforgiving level of humidity. But the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.  The word qigong is a combination of "qi" meaning energy and "gong" which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice explained Lok who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years. It is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow coordinated movements. Movement meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being. Lok explains that "in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty so the first thing to empty is the mind so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing relax all the strength and relax the mind so it's some kind of meditation."Meditation has been shown to improve stress anxiety depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity. As a result qigong itself is a health practice Lok said.Feeling the energyFor Lok it is vital that all his students experience "qi" before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong which has a strong connection with nature he explained. In his class he says that you can start to experience the "qi" by simply holding a specific posture. Your feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints. Lok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground. He then asks his students whether they can sense "qi"-- a warm feeling or  feeling of life in their fingertips often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it the movement routine can begin. He warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing "qi" and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice. The goal of the movement is to clear blockages release pain and refresh the body and mind.Slow and steadyThe movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads rotate their wrists lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that "as soon as you get into it the qi begins to flow."Emotions are also calmed and people tend to live happier Lok believes. In a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.Removing the mysteryCecilia Chan chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.  There are a lot of "misconceptions about qigong" said Chan whose team studies internal qigong or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead the participants use their own energy to do the movements similar to other movement practices like yoga. They do not explore external qigong in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures. Chan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome. Her team conducted studies on women with chronic fatigue in 2012 concluding that qigong "may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning."They conducted another study in 2017 to explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. "From our study we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive" Chan said. "They become less indulged in their suffering and they leave the victim's role more readily." She likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it "teaches a philosophy of letting go" helping those who practice it to embrace a "philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself."Researchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong with their research finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease. Lok however needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. "There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general" he said. "If you have a little time try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong but if you don't try it there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy and the benefit is ever so great.",Health
Nyack New York (CNN)Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph. The crowd claps in unison and a DJ cranks up the music. The banquet hall on the banks of the Hudson pulsates as nine of Cara's best friends lead a procession to the dance floor. It's the start of her Sweet 16 birthday party -- a celebration not just of her big day but of all that has happened in the past year. A way for friends and family to express their love. Cara became a viral sensation months ago after the teen with a seizure disorder delivered a blunt message to her insurer. Her two words for Aetna -- "screw you" -- expressed the anger she felt at being denied a minimally invasive brain surgery that promised to end her seizures. Her story first told by CNN in December triggered a massive uproar and Aetna eventually approved the procedure.This Saturday evening amid the cheers of her closest friends Cara radiates on stage beneath strings of white flashing lights. Then someone shouts and the dance floor clears. Everyone rushes outside. It's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens. Cara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos. "That's what's important in life -- miracles right?" her mother Julie Pressman says pointing to the sky. "I can finally exhale."Her father Rob says it's "like a unicorn coming down.""She's been so happy since the operation" he says. "We're looking forward to a great year."It's a moment the family thought might never come. After Cara speaks Aetna changes policyCara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures. Each time they struck her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field during softball games on stage during plays in the classroom. Most anywhere.Her doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate. It's cutting-edge work performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or in some cases the entire skull cap is removed. Yet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery "experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.""Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition" Aetna said.When first approached for comment by CNN late last year the insurance giant stood by its denial.In response Cara had this message: "Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain I would probably just say 'screw you.' "From there the story took off. The hashtags #ScrewAetna and #CaraPressman were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read "I'm on Cara's team" on the front; on the back the message said #SYA (short for #ScrewYouAetna).Behind the scenes neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwell Health New York's largest health care provider.The hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: "This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own." Solazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.The Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it."I was happy to do that" Mehta said.Cara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery he said he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot. As a result Mehta said her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go."We did our due diligence and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy" he told CNN.Along the way Aetna had a change of heart. In April the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: "Coverage for this service has been approved subject to the requirements in this letter."There was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.Pressed by CNN for answers Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. "Based on recently published clinical evidence the procedure was approved."Aetna went on to say it recently updated its policies for epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation. "Related in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data" Aetna said. "The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met."As shared in December we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies and will continue to do so."Mehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: "She really advocated for herself and it worked out for her. Whatever happened it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her."Northwell's Solazzo added "Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery."'Never been more excited'The day of the surgery July 25 was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister Lindsey crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial everyday stuff as families often do.But make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone. Cara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had "never been more excited for anything in my life." Her first grand mal seizure when she fell to the floor and shook came at the age of 9 but she remembers having smaller aura seizures when she would space out for brief spells as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day sometimes as many as 30."It's been really really difficult to live with" she said. As she was wheeled off to the operating room Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her reassuring her that Cara would be OK. Cara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started. Laser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery known as a temporal lobectomy."This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done" she says.In the operating room the hourlong procedure "went quite well" Mehta said. "Everything went as planned." There are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation Mehta said where laser ablation surgeries are performed with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.A comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: "My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy."The laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents he says because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery Mehta said.Patients can suffer short-term memory loss especially forgetting names of people they meet. "It's not usually something that is devastating especially when you're younger" he says. "Given that she's young we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt."Cara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.Based on her recovery three weeks after surgery he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. "The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures" Mehta says. "We want no seizures."I'm keeping my fingers crossed."A new vibrant CaraAt her birthday party the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.Her sister marvels at her transformation. "She is just flourishing" Lindsey says. "I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself."Cara says it's been "weird" ever since her surgery because "I feel so much better." It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free."It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream but I also know it's real."On stage Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: "One of the funniest people I know."There's the uncle who is "one of the biggest weirdos I know" the friend who "always knows when to cheer me up" and the one who "always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave." She saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner and thanks her for planning the entire party. "She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best" Cara says. "Mom please come up and light the final candle!"As the Beatles' "Here Comes the Sun" echoes across the room Mom rushes to hug her daughter. As the two embrace George Harrison's voice sings:Little darling the smiles returning to the facesLittle darling it seems like years since it's been here.,Health
This is the first part of the series"Escape from the Mayo Clinic." Read the second part here. Sherburn Minnesota (CNN)In a jaw-dropping moment caught on video an 18-year-old high school senior rushes to escape from the hospital that saved her life and then she says held her captive.  At the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.Staff members come running toward him yelling "No! No!" One of them grabs the young woman's arm."Get your hands off my daughter!" her stepfather yells.The car speeds away the stepfather and the patient inside her mother at the wheel.Mayo security calls 911."We have had a patient abduction" the security officer tells police according to a transcript of the call.'A cautionary tale'  The patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.   She and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo "medically kidnapped" her.   Unhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.   According to police Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in "gaining guardianship of Alyssa" who was an adult.A spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo supplied that form to CNN. Alyssa signed the form but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead she provided a statement which said in part "We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient."Read the Mayo Clinic's entire statement to CNN.This story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family a family friend law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.   By everyone's account this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.   "It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly" said Richard Saver a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.    Art Caplan head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine also reviewed the documents and he agrees.  "This should never have happened" he said. "This is a cautionary tale."    A Christmas Day aneurysm  The relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.   On Christmas morning 2016 Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother Amber Engebretson a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson her stepfather since she was 4 years old who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings then 18 months to 11 years old.  They live in Sherburn Minnesota population just over 1000 people about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis on a farm with sheep cows horses and pigs.  Alyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America her favorite club.   Then she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.  "Mom I need you!" Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor vomiting.  It was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.  "You could see looking at her that she was petrified" her stepfather said.   He called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa who'd always been healthy had a ruptured brain aneurysm: A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.  Surgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. A nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it she said.  Amber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.   They begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester Minnesota.  "They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo" said Alyssa's mother Amber Engebretson who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.   But Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive and helicopters couldn't fly.  The weather eventually broke and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.  On Christmas night surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was "grim."Her parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the  #Christmasmiraclegirl.  Alyssa lived up to that name. She survived thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.   "They were like she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds" her stepfather said.   "Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life" added her mother. "We'll be grateful to them forever."On January 30 Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.It should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.  Tensions flare  Although all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.  First doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.  "She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain" her stepfather said.  Many medical authorities including the Mayo Clinic's website say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.  A week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.  "[Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes" Amber wrote on February 7.More disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.  Her parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.  "We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us" Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.  Alyssa's parents say that at their request they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.   "I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered tests left undone and every other question we could think of" Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.Amber says that at one point during that meeting she told the staff she felt like they "don't give a f***" later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter. "We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point" Amber wrote on Facebook that night. Mayo kicks Mom out  On February 22 the day after that meeting Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.  That afternoon Amber says she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care. Amber had requested the meeting and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.  Amber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected the man and the social worker were talking about her family.  "I proceeded to open the door and say 'Since you're talking about my family I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also to be included in the conversation' " she remembers.  She says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her and she took a backward step into the hall. The man who Amber later learned was a physician demanded that she leave.  She says the man told her "I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?"  Amber describes the doctor as "intensely aggressive."  She replied to him she says with similar aggression and frustration: "I need to talk to you. Do you understand me?" The doctor walked away. CNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.  About an hour later Alyssa's parents say the same doctor the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.  "[The doctor] said to me 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now' " Amber remembers.  Amber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.  Later a social worker would tell police that "Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property."According to Alyssa's parents the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.  The couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.  "He said 'There is no patient advocate' and walked away" Amber said.  When asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.  "Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients. As a general practice this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted."Plumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.  "We would never compromise her care" Amber said. "She's our daughter. We love her."  She also says she never put staff members at risk. "We would never do that -- ever" she said. On February 23 the day after Amber was kicked out she went on Facebook.   "PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us" she wrote."I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why no paperwork and no explanations" she continued. "I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!"The response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo and fast.   'Basically a prisoner at Mayo'  Alyssa who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization says that around this time she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.  She says she never received a response.   "They were cruel to me" Alyssa said adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo "as bad as possible."   On February 23 three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab Amber complained on Facebook tagging Mayo.   "They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged" she wrote. "No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo."Alyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.  "I asked two to three times a day and it would go nowhere" Duane said.   "Duane said 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here' " her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. "But there was no response."  Duane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.   "He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem' " Duane remembers. "I even asked him 'can I speak to your supervisor your boss' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room and that was it.'  Duane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.    Olson Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.  "She was truly being held captive" Olson said. "I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams."  The family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.  Two nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa and they kept careful watch according to visitors.  "It was like they were watching every move you made" said Joy Schmitt Alyssa's boyfriend's mother who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.  'They were taking over our daughter' On February 21 the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.Around this time a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa according to the police. If they had succeeded she would have become a ward of the state.Alyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.  On February 26 staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.  The same day Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa according to Duane and Amber's sister April Chance who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.   Duane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.   "The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit" Duane said.  The family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions such as physical and occupational therapy.   "I said 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on' " her aunt remembers. "And they said 'No you're impeding her care.' "   She said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.  "They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter" Duane said.   Mayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date which was supposed to be February 27.  Meanwhile her mother's following was growing on Facebook with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.   One woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.   Articles in The Boston Globe and elsewhere described how in 2013 Pelletier then 14 years old was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward. Amber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.   Through their lawyer John T. Martin the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.   A spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is "committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being" and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.  Amber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles. "OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening" Amber wrote. "It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared."  A Mayo board member steps in  Alyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont Minnesota.  Gaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president. He informed her of the situation and explained that CNN had contacted the family.    "Could you please please do what you can to get your arms around the [situation] immediately?!" he wrote. "Please get to the bottom of this quickly before it blows up even more."But Gaalswyk's pull wasn't enough. He says Mayo treated Alyssa "terribly.""I'm probably the most pro-Mayo person who has walked the face of this earth" said Gaalswyk who left the board January 1. "But this was a mess."He said he thinks Amber probably "used words she shouldn't have" with hospital staff. "I'm not saying that Amber is 100 percent in the right" he added "but I know what Mayo did is not OK at all."In its statement to CNN the Mayo spokeswoman said that "Mayo Clinic is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all the patients we treat."Feeling like they were running out of options Alyssa's parents then enlisted the help of Karie Rego an attorney and patient advocate they'd met on Facebook.  On February 27 Rego spoke on the phone with Joshua Murphy Mayo's chief legal officer and faxed him a letter urging Mayo to transfer Alyssa to another facility.  "Given what has happened here an expedited transfer this coming week would be best for everyone" she wrote.Rego says an attorney in Murphy's office called her later. She says that he told her he  couldn't speak with her and that she never heard anything more from Mayo's legal department.   That night Alyssa's parents thought about Justina Pelletier and the 16 months she spent in state custody. They went online and printed a form for Alyssa to sign saying she was leaving the hospital against medical advice. But her parents didn't know how they would get her out. Two nurses were assigned to keep watch over her at all times. They started to hatch a plan to get her out of Mayo the very next day.Read the second part of "Escape from the Mayo Clinic." ,Health
This is the second part of the series"Escape from the Mayo Clinic." Read the first part here. Sherburn Minnesota (CNN)One winter afternoon last year Duane Engebretson sat in his stepdaughter's hospital room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota trying to figure out how she could escape. Alyssa Gilderhus 18 and a senior in high school had been a patient at Mayo for about two months ever since having a ruptured brain aneurysm on Christmas Day. Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life but she and her parents were unhappy with the care she was receiving in the rehabilitation unit and they say they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred. But they say Mayo refused to let her transfer to another hospital even after a lawyer wrote a letter asking Mayo to make the arrangements. Alyssa and her family began to suspect that Mayo was trying to get a guardian appointed to make medical decisions for her. They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements. Duane and his wife Amber Engebretson weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times. But on February 28 2017 an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room. He looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.  Betty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile. If he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room it might just sound believable he figured.  He put his plan into action about 4 p.m. with his 9-year-old daughter Allie secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.  Duane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.The video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.Two women in scrubs follow them.When the group arrives in the lobby there is no Grandma Betty.  Duane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.As he approaches the car the front passenger door opens.There is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat."Alyssa we're going to go home honey. Come on" Amber says to her daughter.As Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat the two women in scrubs run toward her and someone yells "No!" "Yes she is! Yes she is!" Duane and Amber yell back.The video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her."Get your hands off my daughter" Duane yells at the aide.Duane closes the car door and gets in the back seat."Get out of here Amber" he tells his wife. "Go go go go go go!"The car drives away from Mayo.  Recalling her escape some months later Alyssa says it felt "phenomenal.""It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders" she said. 'We have a patient abduction' At 4:28 p.m. a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.  "We have a patient abduction" the caller said. An officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later. A Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa "cannot make decisions for herself" and that her mother couldn't care for her "because Amber has mental health issues."The social worker also told police she "understood there was no formal diagnosis" for Amber.Amber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.  "It's absolutely absurd" Amber said. "She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification." The social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties "trying to get emergency guardianship" but had been unable to get court orders to do so.An Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that "Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa." But something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.  If Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself as the social worker had said and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?  When police asked that question of Mayo staffers Sherwin said they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.   "When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient" Sherwin said.  He said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa "in fact could make decisions on her own" -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.  "There was no abduction. This was done under her own will" he said. "You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning."Though satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions Sherwin still was concerned about her health.  "What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital" Sherwin said.Mayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves. But first the police had to find Alyssa.  Police search for Alyssa  Alyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones and they weren't at home either.They later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.  "We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again" Duane said. Unable to find the family the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato Minnesota about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa according to a Mankato police report.It turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart purchasing a wheelchair a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube which Duane says he'd been trained to use.  They then checked into a nearby hotel.  While at the hotel the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked. The deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them according to the family. Alyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel. It was now almost 9 p.m. and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels. As Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway a sheriff's deputy called urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson about 75 miles away. But then the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility. After the calls from police Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.   They got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.  "I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later" he said. 'This kid is in danger'  The next afternoon March 1 one of Alyssa's doctors a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim a Rochester police investigator.The doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger."The longer she's away the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very very sick" the physician said according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN. The day Alyssa left Mayo that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.  "Alyssa's medical condition medical status cognition and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care" the doctors wrote. "She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather."Alyssa was at risk for pneumonia malnourishment dehydration aspiration infection and falling according to the note. She didn't have her medications with her and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube according to the discharge summary.The doctor said Alyssa was probably "a ways from here by now" and requested a wider-scale search."[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor" the doctor said."We wouldn't do that nationally" Bush-Seim responded. "That wouldn't be done."Without a national search the doctor said "we're not gonna find her."Bush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had "done everything they possibly could to find her.""There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger" Alyssa's doctor responded.The police back off But other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician. Less than 12 hours after leaving Mayo she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.  They explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice according to medical records from that emergency room visit. The Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.  Although Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.Mayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment. When police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home they stepped aside. "If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion that kind of takes the law out of it" said Chris Vasvick a Martin County sheriff's deputy. "That's one doctor's opinion against another and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all." Sherwin the Rochester detective agreed.  "We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene" Sherwin said.He added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them."As parents they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest" Sherwin said.   A few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room Alyssa and her parents went home.  A letter from Mayo was waiting for them thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.   The family found it ironic given that it was dated  March 1 the day after Alyssa left the hospital.  A few days later another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.  "We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo" the administrator wrote.  On Facebook Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.  "This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!!" she wrote.'Hospitals aren't prisons' To understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case CNN showed experts key documents including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.  The experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture. "You're only hearing one side" cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner a professor of pediatrics medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.After reviewing the documents the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa who was 18 and legally an adult to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred according to the family.  They said that typically adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice and they can leave without signing any paperwork. "Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will" said George Annas an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.  But Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.   "Due to the severity of her brain injury she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions" her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.  In that report the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked "the capacity to decide to sign releases of information make pain medication dose changes and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice." That hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions yet in the discharge note they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.  It didn't jibe with the experts either.  "They can't eat their cake and have it too" said Feudtner the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.Even if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa. Brian Smith the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa. "The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her" he told CNN. If that happened Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo as she was already receiving treatment there Smith said.  Bush-Seim the Rochester police investigator spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.  The legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient they said rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.  Robert McLeod a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa as he did not want to comment on any specific case.  He said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.  "From my 25 years of experience a judge is going to say 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason" said McLeod an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul Minnesota. Other experts agreed. Saver the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.  "It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy" Saver said. "I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to." Alyssa said her biological father Jason Gilderhus told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.   Even if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out there were other friends and relatives to turn to such as her stepfather grandmother great-grandmother aunt or boyfriend's mother.  "It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian" added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.Another feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.  Caplan the NYU bioethicist said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.   An ethics committee would listen to the doctors other staff members the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.   The family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.   Annas the lawyer at Boston University agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control. "Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time and they can either escalate or de-escalate" Annas said. "An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate."  The experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case the conflict escalated. "I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital" said Cochran of the University of California.  "I felt sad" said Feudtner the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. "Viewed in its entirety this did not go well for anybody who was involved."Gaalswyk the former Mayo board member said he hopes the hospital learns something. "I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo" he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. "The situation need not get out of hand like it did." Being 'held hostage in an American hospital'  While the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways according to patient advocates.  Dr. Julia Hallisy founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.    "You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital" she said. "People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story."  Kristen Spyker said it happened to her family.  When Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.   She said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.  "The surgeon said 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss and I say what happens' " she said.  She said a social worker accompanied by hospital security guards then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.  Spyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action. Her son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor. When she told her story on Facebook Spyker said other parents shared similar stories.  "It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us'" she said. "They had been so embarrassed to talk about it but they felt freer when I said it happened to us."  Spyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while  their daughter was at Mayo.  In a statement to CNN the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.  "Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment" said Dr. Jay Bhatt senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. "Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for."When hospitals and families get into intense conflict Hallisy a dentist who practices in San Francisco says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter Katherine was being treated for cancer.  "People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements but they're human beings and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over" she said.  She said that in Alyssa's case she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer perhaps a social worker could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.  She thinks back to her daughter who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital. She thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away as well as farms and a family business to run.  "They were under incredible stress" Hallisy said. "They'd almost lost a child and they had other responsibilities too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that."  The prom queen graduatesMore than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic Alyssa now 20 has belied her "grim prognosis." Last year she graduated from Martin County West High School receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award. Her feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.  She finished up her physical and speech therapy in March about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.Alyssa has not filed a lawsuit but has engaged Martin the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.  Alyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital. "I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her" her stepfather said. They say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.   They think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff especially a senior physician.    "I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what" her mother said.   She's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.  "We stand by it 100 percent" her stepfather said. ,Health
 (CNN)As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face she could feel the wound.Her vision is greatly impaired due to her injury but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat. She could feel where her face was swollen. She could feel the portions that were missing.That was before Katie at 21 became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant performed last year aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.Now Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.She is featured on the cover of National Geographic magazine's September issue which debuted Tuesday in an article titled "The Story of a Face" and in National Geographic's full-length documentary "Katie's Face."'I had no clue what a face transplant was'In the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt she faced a number of emotional hurdles. She underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship. Around that time Katie's mother Alesia was abruptly fired from a teaching job at Katie's school because Alesia "questioned several decisions that were made lacking integrity" Katie's father Robb told CNN.On March 25 2014 when Katie was 18 her older brother Robert Stubblefield heard the gunfire and found her after she harmed herself in a bathroom at his home in Mississippi.He was devastated.Katie doesn't remember that tragic day when she lost her face. She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later. It was in Memphis where Katie's parents Robb and Alesia heard the term "face transplant" for the first time. "There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind' and he said 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant' " Robb said. "I was standing there thinking 'What do you mean a face transfer? What do you do?' "When Katie was later told about the possible procedure she said she was equally stunned."I had no clue what a face transplant was" Katie said. "When my parents helped explain everything to me I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again."Full and partial face transplants are medical procedures that involve replacing all or parts of a person's face with donated tissue including skin bone nerves and blood vessels from a deceased donor.Katie's procedure involved transplanting the scalp forehead upper and lower eyelids eye sockets nose upper cheeks upper jaw and half of lower jaw upper teeth lower teeth partial facial nerves muscles and skin -- effectively replacing her full facial tissue according to Cleveland Clinic.Similar to Katie the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient Connie Culp underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.That was a near-total face transplant. The world's first successful full face transplant was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona Spain in 2010.As for where Katie fits in "only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant and we believe that she is the 39th person" said Susan Goldberg editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine."We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year" Goldberg said of the magazine. "We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science."'You take it for granted the different components of our faces'Before Katie's face transplantation surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw said Dr. Brian Gastman a plastic surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.The surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister Olivia McCay to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction."We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant" Gastman said.He noted that when he first saw Katie's injury he worried that she might not live.In March 2016 Katie was placed on the waiting list for a face transplant. Fourteen months later a donor was found: Adrea Schneider a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose National Geographic reported. Before the procedure Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor. After she was cleared to receive her new face the 31-hour surgery began May 4 2017. It involved 11 surgeons several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day."I am able to touch my face now and it feels amazing" said Katie who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.Her father Robb translated some of her sentiments: "You take it for granted the different components of our faces -- the bone the tissue the muscle everything -- but when it's gone you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant you're so thankful."Katie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of transplant rejection which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.Katie also continues physical and occupational therapy works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons."I'm definitely taking many many daily steps" Katie said of her rehab progress adding that her family has been a big help in her recovery and that her faith has kept her strong."Life is precious and life is beautiful" she said.Face transplantation is considered experimental and insurance companies Medicare and Medicaid don't cover it. A grant from the US Department of Defense through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine covered Katie's transplant according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including face transplantation -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women."I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One because of the type of wound that she suffered but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers" Robb said. "She's in that late-teen to early 20s where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured."While Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation there are many other hopes for her future.Katie plans to attend college online soon possibly followed by a career in counseling and motivational speaking. She hopes to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention."My first wish for Katie is to be happy" Gastman said. "That's number one but beyond that I'd like her to have some level of normalcy" he said. "Then she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects -- for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are. Further on the other hand how much a singular rash decision made by so many young people today could negatively change your whole life."He said Katie "had the ultimate second chance."Suicide awareness remains critical said Katie's mother Alesia.Globally close to 800000 people die due to suicide every year which is about one person every 40 seconds according to the World Health Organization. In the US suicide rates significantly climbed in 44 states from 1999 through 2016 according to a report published in June by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 45000 lives were lost to suicide in 2016 and more than half of people who died by suicide did not have a known mental health condition.In 2016 guns were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the US accounting for 22963 -- almost half of all -- suicide deaths according to the National Institute of Mental Health.Among young people "I think we do a pretty decent job of educating them about sex and about drinking and driving" but education around suicide prevention is lacking Alesia said."I can honestly tell you for Katie we do not believe for one moment that she wanted to die" Alesia said. "But we do believe she hit that low where she definitely tried and thought about it and for a moment -- 20 seconds or less -- kids can make those decisions.",Health
Petersburg Indiana (CNN)When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control she said her doctor was a "cheerleader" for one option and one option only: Essure.Potts says the device which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.It was so bad that she had a hysterectomy removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.Last week the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.Potts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?A CNN analysis of federal data shows that from August 2013 through December 2017 Bayer paid 11850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.These payments are legal but very controversial.Potts' doctor was one of the highest earners according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.More than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service one of just three doctors to earn more than $100000.The financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that but the database doesn't go back that far and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years."I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal $5000 to $7000 a year" she said.Basinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.Studies by scientists at the University of North Carolina Yale University the George Washington University and Harvard Medical School among others show that when doctors are paid by pharmaceutical companies they're more likely to prescribe drugs made by those companies.In those studies the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money."I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way" she said.She said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it."I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money" she said. "A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians."She added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.Bayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will pull the device off the market and that it stands by the safety of its product.But according to a US Food and Drug Administration statement put out the same day the device has been associated with "serious risks including persistent pain perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen."Bayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices "The Bleeding Edge."On Friday Bayer posted a "fact check" to the documentary which states that the film "presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure."Also Friday the pharmaceutical company published an "Open Letter to Patients and Providers About Essure" which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure "was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women."The Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.Their private Facebook group Essure Problems has more than 37000 members including more than 12000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device according to group founder Angie Firmalino.'I felt like she was very pushy'When Potts who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg Indiana gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006 she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.Potts then 27 asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear."She was very upbeat about it" Potts said. "I felt like she was very pushy."She and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches joint pain abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.She said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child then 8 to help with her three younger children."It was hard" she said.Since the hysterectomy her symptoms have almost completely gone away she said.Potts says she's angry that in her memory Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied also known as tubal ligation the other option for permanent female birth control.She felt "violated" because she felt that her choice was taken away."I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision more or less because she said that this was best and I wasn't really given another option" she said.Basinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures."In my notes I did document that I talked about risks benefits and alternatives with her" Basinski said.Another patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient who requested not to be named to protect her privacy later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.Basinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation."We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits" she said. "It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other."But Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.In 2009 she appeared on "The Balancing Act" a television show aimed at women along with Trista Sutter a former "Bachelorette" contestant who had been implanted with the device.The host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure."Well I'm going to tell you something because of Miss Trista here I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure" Basinski said. "When women find out about this they want this procedure."CNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure. "Knowing Dr. Basinski I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them" said Cindy Dossett who was implanted with Essure in 2008. "I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to and I wouldn't say that about all doctors."'That looks like a bribe'In a statement to CNN Bayer said that "close cooperation with and continuous education of healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help."The statement added that health care professionals "are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities."Friday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts.   "These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure" it states. "They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase prescribe or otherwise support Essure."Dr. Martin Makary a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research he doubted that the more than 11000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts."That looks like a bribe" he said. "That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors."Data on EssureThe FDA estimates that Essure has been used by more than 750000 patients worldwide since it was approved on November 4 2002. At the time Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc. which Bayer acquired in June 2013. From 2002 through 2017 the patient problems most frequently reported to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21215) heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9846) headache (7231) fatigue (5842) and weight fluctuations (4970).According to the FDA reported adverse events "cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence severity or frequency of problems associated with devices" and "confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report."In April the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.Basinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year."I think it is a safe and viable option for women and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option" she said.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.This story has been updated with additional comments from Bayer and added detail on the adverse event reporting process for medical devices.,Health
San Francisco California (CNN)Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids. So it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013 nearly five years later Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son Henry one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later with their newborn in their arms they exchanged vows and were legally married. Having Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers they needed a support group legal help extensive research reams of documents reproductive science and about $150000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate. One embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday. Then came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.The fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.The eggs she wasn't usingTaroli 47 was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood he was open to a variety of options.Li however was keen on having a biological child making the decision of how to proceed easy Taroli said. Henry "got his sperm and my name."  They scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center studying pictures and written statements. They settled on "Isabelle" a name chosen by the potential donor and elected to sit down with her in person. She was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially as she had family support and scholarships but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.Isabelle the name she preferred to go by for this story also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more."Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them" she said by Skype from the United Kingdom where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. "I thought 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'"She also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who without someone else's eggs might never have children.Isabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs."No no no -- don't do it" Isabelle remembered her pleading. "What's the point?" She ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7000 to $8000 each time she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections. Most of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle the experience she appreciated most went to two men who chose her.She was excited to meet the people "who wanted my eggs to be part of their family" she said. When they got together in the clinic offices Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li who didn't want to speak for this story sat by with a clipboard she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.Isabelle now 29 has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.Capable but 'not interested in carrying my own'They came to know their embryos well including their sexes through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings which measured their viability and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents. Next Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.  A traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process if they chose a carrier who also lived in California would be less legally complicated for the gay dads Taroli explained.  The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead both of their names would. A few hours north of Castro Valley the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family in which the women generally have five or six kids and her pregnancy had been "really really easy" she said.An article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.The surrogate asked to be identified as "Audrey" to protect her privacy. "I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable" Audrey said. "It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own." Her husband whom she's been with for more than 16 years also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother Audrey said was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother however were completely on board. It was her father divorced from her mother and living several states away who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before and Audrey then 30 was prepared to move forward. It wasn't about the money for her although the $27000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.She'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth. The agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.With her husband and 3-year-old son with her Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward sort of like heading into a blind date she said."They brought me flowers which was really sweet" she remembered. "You could tell how much they were trying to impress me."Like her husband who works in IT so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up they shared their histories and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate not just during the pregnancy but after a proposition that made her smile. She left feeling like in them she'd found her match. 'Not just a vessel for their child'After some additional testing at the fertility center Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.  She laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her she said and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary. Eating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers. For many people in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch. She Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit the two men would take her and her family out to dinner. "They really valued me" Audrey said. "They saw me as a person not just a vessel for their child."She recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant someone asked her son "Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother?" The young boy answered without skipping a beat "That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby." As her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room she held off on pushing and screamed out "Are the dads here? Are they here?" A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.Audrey and her husband who was also in the room watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper."They were so funny" Audrey now 36 remembered. "They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son and it was so cute to see that in someone else." Audrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.She and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other but they still get updates and pictures. 'He's not my son'Isabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs still.  And as a result they've seen pictures of one another as they're both central to Henry's story. Isabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey."I remember thinking she had my egg inside of her" she said. "That's just crazy." Isabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1½. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry."I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being" said Taroli who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.The clinic in turn put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.Isabelle's mother who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy. That would come later. The first visit with Taroli Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone. As she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe "This is my baby" she said. "But then when I got there and I saw Henry he couldn't have cared less" she said with a laugh. "I was just another person in the room. Yes he's genetically my son but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me." She tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and "is probably more attached to him than I am" Isabelle said. Sometimes she wonders if Taroli and Li had had a girl whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.Taroli and Li told her at one point that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use."It would be quite ironic wouldn't it?" asked Isabelle who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos if she needed them someday stayed in the back of her mind.An ocean between them Taroli was texting with his mom with his television on in the background when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage he said to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland Ohio.He had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction so did San Francisco.He fired off an email to the fertility clinic not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li who is establishing a new business in China was abroad so Taroli sent him a message too with a link to the TV segment. A day or two later Taroli said he got a late evening call from the clinic confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed however would take further testing. To test an embryo requires that it be thawed first which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK they could hope that the others were too. "So we did that" Taroli said over coffee in April. "They all came back dead." With thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them the couple processed what this meant for them."They were viable lives. They were potential babies four boys and a girl that if we chose to could have been our kids" Taroli said. "It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility." And it's the death of what might have been for Henry who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.Taroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son who recently turned 5 and the extra big hugs he was getting. "If I get upset he cries" Taroli said. "I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him." Breaking the newsIt was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start and they deserved to know how it ended.Before he got to Isabelle though she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know out of the blue whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately. If the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit she said she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.The exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.When she woke up at 4 a.m. she said she had an email from Taroli telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again he wondered. The clinic contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions would not comment for this story.The news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle."For some reason I kept thinking about the little girl egg" she said and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. "They would never become people. But then I guess we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people right?"Isabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again her eggs were theirs.Audrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child but she hated that the option was taken away from them.Because her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.After that she said she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li."They were so great and I love them so much" Audrey said. "I would do it a million times over again for them." Taroli and Li knew this.'Happy with where we are'Pacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round and their doctor whom they don't blame in any way was eager to have them go through the process again. But Taroli and Li after processing the shock mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now have decided they aren't interested in going through this again. They're getting older they love their life with Henry Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart and now is not the time for them to have more children.The truth is they may have never used those embryos but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms."If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet our thinking might have been different" Taroli said. "We're happy with where we are." Meantime attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again. "I work in tech where lives aren't on the line" Taroli said. "You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens." He doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies and he knows that for some for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.But for him and Li they will love the child they do have stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here. And someday when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings they'll find the words to explain. ,Health
Columbia South Carolina (CNN)Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room. She points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior a small sculpture of her riding a wolf. At 13 Emmy has undergone an awakening. Just months ago she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive. She was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.The very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her."It's horrifying to know that every day you would give your child a medicine that in essence could kill them" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. "It's just really scary."For Emmy every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable. The first time she was given an insulin shot she stopped breathing fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout "I'll be a good girl!""We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive" her parents would say.For nine years she suffered like this. Beyond the pain she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much she struggled with memory and an array of other issues. Her parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.Desperate her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. "Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin while we find a solution to her allergy" Jack Reeves wrote.More than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.  Emmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes.  He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.But that email set in motion a chain of events resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes. "It's amazing. She's a totally different child" her mother said. "Every day that she does not reject this organ I'm going to hug her even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her."'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'Kandaswamy the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father "like it was yesterday."Kandaswamy who has two daughters himself felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child.  But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.Only nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done  in a child this young he said was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor Dr. David Sutherland who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.  "Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children" Kandaswamy said. But his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself " 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question and you will get your answer."Kandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. "I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy" he said. "Looking at her you could see: 'Hey if this was your daughter what would you do?'"You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling" said Kandaswamy who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. "Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival."He had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital and if the surgery didn't go as planned the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted."There was a huge amount of apprehension" Kandaswamy said. "I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well."A team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons anesthesiologists nephrologists allergists transplant coordinators pain management specialists and others. After a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life. "We didn't make the decision without due thought and process" Kandaswamy said. "We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here."Kandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child the surgical techniques and post-transplant  management have advanced to the point that his team could "successfully perform a transplant in a child this young."A healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks including the possibility her body would reject the organ."Pediatric patients they have very active immune systems and they will try to spit out any kind of organ" Kandaswamy said.Emmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available. Before she headed north though Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana feast on a steak in Texas visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California where she once lived. The family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list. It was her parents say a farewell trip should she not survive.False alarms and the magic momentEmmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available. Three times the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.At one low point Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still she battled on.Then came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9 Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves her favorite animal with her tutor at a museum. Mom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well. At the hospital Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic. Emmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived. About 3 a.m. Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. "I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good" he said. On Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.As Emmy underwent surgery Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes. The surgery took more than four hours. "It was a great great feeling when we got her done" Kandaswamy said. "But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point."The doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed "Player 2" -- worked properly that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.She responded well the first week but in the second week after the transplant her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it."I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection" her mother said. "We're not sure what's going to happen in the future."They decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. "We're already down the rabbit hole Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do" Emmy said.Ever since her pancreas has functioned as hoped.Dr. Melina Bellin the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy said it was "touch-and-go" early on but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around."It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted" she said. "It definitely makes it that much better when it does."Kandaswamy added "We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around."With the healthy new pancreas he said her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and "blunting her consciousness" Kandaswamy said. "Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming" he said. "It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way."One of the greatest moments of his career Kandaswamy said was when Emmy hugged him: "There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up give me a hug and say 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard."Pancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. "I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness" he said.Speaking up to help othersIn the family home in Columbia South Carolina Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister Abby. "She's getting a childhood finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid" her mother said. "I mean this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years."The family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she. "If our experience could help even one kid I think it would be worth it" Tiffanie said.Emmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. "We still live life and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to" her father said. Emmy hopes to be a zoologist one day. For now she's shy around CNN's camera and doesn't want to talk with cameras rolling. When they're off she stands next to a window overlooking her backyard and a decaying swing set.She says she's drawn sketches of what she envisions back there: a greenhouse a new swing set a fire pit and a fence. When the Make-A-Wish Foundation reached out she told them she didn't want to travel anywhere fancy or meet a famous star. Instead she shared her vision of a new backyard a place where she can finally be herself.,Health
Petros Tennessee (CNN)Fifty years ago a career criminal named James Earl Ray traveled from Atlanta to Memphis stalking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him. While King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace) Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away. Over the next two months while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List Ray was on the run traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee surrounded by thick wooded hills. In its day it was considered one of the toughest state prisons where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel "The Silence of the Lambs" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.Brushy was also nearly impossible to escape but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days though "rescued" is probably the better description. Cold hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from "The Great Escape" to "Blair Witch Project." Ray himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days a detail that made one local long-distance runner Gary Cantrell think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.And thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted. Man vs. landCantrell whose nickname is "Lazarus Lake" or "Laz" as he is known by everyone was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name "brushy" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts bruises and falls. It's so dense you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.These mountains where a day hike can be a challenge are where truly competitive racing should be held he thought not on a flat paved well-marked course.The Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told it has about 67000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29000 feet -- not that the other 67000 feet of descent are much easier. The loops are run back to back over three sleepless days and nights on unmarked trails. Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes aid stations teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish but the Barkley is designed so racers fail. And fail they do. Of more than 1000 who've entered only 15 have completed the full distance in time. "It's a good place for your ego to take a beating" Laz said before this year's race sporting a red beanie labeled "Geezer." His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight like the Yoda of the runner's world.  Among ultramarathoners the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective of course. There are footraces that cross deserts traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.It's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.How it works (or doesn't)For a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down of course) all to maximize the challenge. Some of the choice unwritten rules include:No GPS or phones. The only permitted technology is a cheap watch from Walmart handed out by Laz to each runner and synchronized to his watch.Unmanned checkpoints (13 this year) which are paperback books. You rip out the page that corresponds to your bib number to prove that you reached it. You must have all the book pages in hand at the end of each loop. The books are hidden under rocks or taped to trees usually. 60-hour cutoff. Two years ago Gary Robbins got turned around in his exhaustion with only 2 miles to go arriving at the campground a few seconds over time disqualified not just for missing the time cutoff but for going off-route.No aid stations. Philosophical Laz: "Being totally free doesn't come without risk."No outside assistance. No friends and family to meet you with food or socks except at the camp between loops. No hints as to the location of checkpoints or map secrets. This year's theme according to cackling Yoda-esque Laz: "Help is not coming." Start time TBD. A conch is blown one hour before the race starts but that can be anywhere between midnight and noon. "The uncertainty is half the fun" Laz said with a chortle "and one of the hardest things to deal with."Entry fee is $1.60 a pair of socks (this year) and an essay. Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars but Laz isn't in it for the money though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.Thousands apply every year and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website email or physical address posted anywhere. Would-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete and Laz chooses among these factoring in their arguments or in some cases poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted runners get a "letter of condolence" and told the date of the race (also a secret) and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.'Good luck morons'This year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements. Four or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as "Where Do We Go From Here" and "A Time to Die." I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read "You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff unless it is foggy then you will have to guess."Chicken and beans cooked over an open fire were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read "Good luck morons."Because you don't know when the race is going to start it makes for a fitful night's sleep lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.Mercifully or just randomly Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m. under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start Laz gave few remarks none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years Laz removed his hat and a bugler played taps the traditional song of military funerals.Tradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or as Laz described it "the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that it turns ugly."Although he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon) Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley for whom he named the race. '4/5 Pure Joy 1/5 Pure Hell' The details of the race are a well-guarded secret and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map. The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.The race takes place every spring a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing. "This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog" Laz said pausing for his punch line: "at the same time." This year it started pleasantly cool and cloudy but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.Between each loop runners will eat doctor their feet maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops two are clockwise two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop five made it to the third loop and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out a bugler played taps. Like some previous years it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.Finishing is so rare there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune 2011's only finisher calculated "4/5 Pure Joy 1/5 Pure Hell." Andrew Thompson finished in 2009 after setting the speed record for the 2160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47½ days. "Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected" he wrote. "All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick and cold and damn happy to be done."Only one person Jared Campbell has finished the race three times. "I am thrilled" he said after finishing in 2016 "setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60." In 2014 he was more philosophical: "There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life." And in 2012 he was nearly psychedelic: "Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts which was both an educational and beautiful experience."In 2013 finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: "The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself." 'A different breed'To reach the Barkley you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual "human sacrifice" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals also known as periodization building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: "100% self-extraction") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia. Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley plenty of other gear is including compasses walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that "snapped in two" Laz said and the runner still finished the loop. "It's a different breed" he cackled.Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners according to a recent study by the University of California Davis and Stanford University though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1212 active ultrarunners in the study injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40) less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies hay fever and exercise-induced asthma probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general running is outstanding cardio exercise benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.As for the mental rewards -- well that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A "sense of accomplishment" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line it most certainly means going through hell to get there.,Health
 (CNN)With a drop of a pan Shalom Blac's life changed forever."I remember just screaming and scraping my body and my skin was literally falling on the floor" Blac said.  "I remember my mom telling me that I fainted. She thought I was gone."When she was 9 Shalom and her younger sister were napping under a table at their mother's restaurant in Nigeria. Her mom unaware of the sleeping girls below placed a pot of hot oil on the table. Someone accidentally knocked the pot over scalding the sisters.  The girls were rushed to the hospital severely burned. Eventually an aunt got them visas so they could come to the United States and undergo several surgeries. A dark placeAfter the accident Shalom's life took a "huge huge turn.""Kids that I used to play with they were either scared of me or some would call me 'monster' and 'two-face' and just laugh. I started thinking about committing suicide because of the bullying." As a little girl Shalom loved playing with her mother's makeup. But she first learned how to properly wear it during her hospital stay in the United States."They were teaching me how to do makeup even though I wasn't good. I used to just have concealer all over my face and go to school. It was horrible."Then one day while watching YouTube she came across cosmetics tutorials that changed her life. "That's how I picked up on how to do a lot of different stuff. And I started applying that to how I want my makeup to look and how I want to look with makeup. " A girl in one particular YouTube video really struck a nerve. "She was a young girl who was battling cancer and she was completely bald. I was just like 'Oh my how is she so young and so brave to come on camera in a public place?' So I just decided to challenge myself and do the thing that scares me the most." Shalom started making her own YouTube videos. Without makeup she let the world see her as she is scars and all. "I just decided to do a video and then post a picture of me without my wig which was a big deal. I was so scared but seeing people tell me how my picture or my videos have inspired them really pushed me to do more and share with people." YouTube sensation Shalom's transformation videos in which she demonstrates how she uses makeup to change her looks went viral.

Portland Oregon (CNN)All Erika Zak wants to do is play with her daughter on the playground. Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.She's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.At 38 Erika is dying.Her battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter Loïe was born four years ago when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. The cancer was removed from her colon and her doctors say she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts. Every day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections bleeding and an array of other health issues.She has high blood pressure in her liver which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die. "Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding we all hold our breath worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?" says Dr. Skye Mayo her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University. "This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like."More than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver. After weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January Erika finally got her big break. On February 2 doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant. The news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house 4-year-old Loïe would say "Mommy when you get a new liver can you push me in the swing?"But Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer UnitedHealthcare denied coverage for the transplant saying it would not be a "promising treatment." She appealed and was rejected again. The mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Loïe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned: Dear LoïeIf you're reading this I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect warm breeze upon your sweet face.Erika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious. Outraged and heartbroken Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC) giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process riddled with errors that determined her life wasn't worth saving.Weeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea the answer was the same: Denied. Then last week an amazing thing happened. 'My life hangs in the balance'If it's true that opening your heart revealing your feelings unleashes freedom and makes you whole Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing. It was early April. She sat at her computer her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband Scott Powers and their daughter Loïe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible. There was too much at stake. UnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant saying "unproven health services is not a covered benefit." The words burned like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.The young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group David Wichmann. Her frame may be tiny but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet. As she typed Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for "my only option" a liver transplant."Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review" she wrote "it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC."She blasted what she called the "shockingly incompetent manner" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from "chemotherapy toxicity" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had "life-threatening lesions.""Neither are true" she wrote Wichmann. "(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays incomplete responses inept scheduling contradictory statements and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history. "Most importantly decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months." One review doctor noted she had a "9cm tumor" in her liver she wrote apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure. "I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along" Erika wrote. "Now when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest I need UHC's support more than ever."She sent the letter via FedEx on April 11. Her concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer but instead was the result of "a consequence of complications following microwave ablation."  "Of note what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity which was a secondary cause of liver failure."The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time."Two days after sending her letter Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review. Several times the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision. As time wore on Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2 the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.On Instagram she posted an illustration with the words "waiting waiting waiting" on a pink backdrop with black crosses. "Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver" she wrote. "Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved."'Wait or die'More than 100000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery said Dr. Andrew Cameron the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program. For liver transplants 20000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7000 will receive a new liver in 2018 according to Cameron who is not connected to Erika's case. "The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure" he said. "Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die."Transplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant Cameron said typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in. It is deeply disturbing he said when an insurance company overrules the "decision made by a thoughtful careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life."The negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200000 Cameron said adding it is "exceedingly rare" for an insurer to deny a transplant. "That is highly unusual and highly undesirable" Cameron told CNN. In Cleveland Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.   It's groundbreaking and could prove transformative. "I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent" he said.  When you're trying such a new approach Dr. Aucejo said it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done "in a more expeditious way."He explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with "unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer" but the "outcomes were not good."Only 18% of the patients lived past five years so the transplants were stopped Dr. Aucejo said. But he emphasized most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since he said.Doctors in Europe primarily in Norway have begun changing the field he said finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years. That is a substantial difference he said. Dr. Mayo Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process "to help explain the facts of her case." That is troubling he said especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see. "It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered" Dr. Mayo said. "Her life now is not limited by her cancer" he said. "It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant."When opposites attractErika was in the prime of her life. At 34 she'd given birth to her first and only child Loïe the little girl who Mom calls "my tiniest most amazing companion." She'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design both in Providence. The two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast she from the free-wheeling West Coast.The connection wasn't immediate so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it. Soon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her he found the woman who he'd always searched for with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth. They tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg California.  Her career was taking off too. She was working for Old Navy choosing and designing the fabrics prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant she was promoted to senior textile designer."It was all coming together" she wrote on her blog. "And then like that my foundation crumbled."During the final trimester of her pregnancy she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side. On April 8 2014 she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old. "Worst Day Ever" read the headline of her blog.She had survived cancer once before. At 28 she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis. In the years after her colon cancer diagnosis she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group."Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?" she wrote. In her blog posts she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy. She'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position screaming and sobbing. It was "anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself" she blogged. Her fingertips felt like they had been "burned on a hot pan most of the time." Her hands cramped into weird contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.As a teen she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times she said "I hoped that I could just disappear forever.""It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here" she wrote on December 1 2016 two and half years into her cancer battle. She would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28 2017 she wrote:"This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day." On another day she penned: "Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability."On April 4 2017 nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis but it remained in her liver. "Mommy are you going to last?" Loïe asked."What do you mean Loïe?""Will you be here forever and ever?" the girl asked."I really don't know babe."Six days later Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver. To save her life surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile. With bile going immediately outside her body instead of through the liver and her body Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds. "All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her" Dr. Mayo said. "She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids."The cancer in her liver meanwhile was progressing on a path he said where "she would die of cancer." She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment. Her doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab known by its brand name Keytruda.Her sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. "She had an incredible response to this new drug" Dr. Mayo said. "I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure."With a new liver he said her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone too.But transplant surgery is not without major risks. Most of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months. Most of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care like chemotherapy or surgery he said profoundly prolonging their lives. For a small subset of patients though the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery he said. "Unfortunately in that subset of patients the survival is more dismal."While it's impossible to predict the outcome he said Erika shows "features that may do well." There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver he said. Plus patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant Dr. Aucejo said tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: "That's a good indicator."Dr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise. "We're talking about distributing limited organs" he said. "Again we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs."'This is so messed up'In the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO her husband Scott worked the phones. He felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision. Finally they were told a decision would come May 2. Erika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message weeping for much of the video. "My life is literally in their hands and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more" she says. "I don't want to leave. I don't want to die."The next day came. Each minute crept by.Shortly after 2 p.m. Scott's phone rang. It was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.He had crushing news: Denied.He explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them he said "changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'" However the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: "The bottom line is they're upholding that decision."The doctor who sided in favor of the transplant their UHC contact told them was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon. Scott grew furious. "Honestly you know that is messed up" he said. "I don't know who you've got to go to but I would go to someone now and have someone call us because this is so messed up."Scott pressed for more information. He got little. "Scott I know what you've been through" the UHC rep told him. "I know what you're going through."Erika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words it was time to speak up. "Hey!" she shouted. "This is Erika and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying."Through tears she said "I need a liver transplant and I need it now."The UHC rep confided he "was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news." He suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies. "Someone needs to be accountable for this" he said. "You know why when we have these guidelines in place did we not follow them?"That needs to be looked into" he said adding "I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug."He apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note. "Like I said I wish I had better news." After more than 30 minutes he ended with: "Have a good night OK." Not the words the couple wanted to hear. Erika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings. Scott felt equally distraught. "I just want her to get a liver" he said. "She deserves that."The CEO never responded -- not by email phone or letter.A sudden changeFive days later on Monday May 7 a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Loïe for school when Scott's phone rang. They had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left and they didn't want to blow it. They hadn't sent any new information since the last call.It was their UHC rep on the phone. This time he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.When Scott heard she'd been approved he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room. There was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps. Erika called her mother who unleashed a guttural scream at work. Dr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors nurses and staff celebrated.In Cleveland Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial. "They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them" he said. "I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision."I had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.I was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. "UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever" Scott texted.  When we met a couple hours later Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now suddenly she has hope for more. Glancing at her daughter and husband Erika broke down in tears. "I can't imagine not being here" she said. "It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.""Mommy why are you crying?" Loïe said."I'm crying because I love you."Loïe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand. "Love you" Loïe said.As she and Loïe locked hands the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: "Be brave."EpilogueUnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case except to issue this one-sentence statement:"We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request."Even after the approval Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.It can mean the difference between life and death. "No one should have to fight and work that hard" she said "especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life."Since the approval the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.It's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a "MELD score" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority. Erika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range Dr. Aucejo said her transplant could be a few months away."But this varies a lot" he said. "There are many variables at play here."A patient for a liver transplant he said is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.Would Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?"That is very speculative at the least" Dr. Aucejo said. "I couldn't say that."He chose his words carefully saying it's a "complex dynamic" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance. "She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant."Dr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition. "It's a new territory" he told CNN. "I can't blame anybody."If Erika receives her transplant and succeeds Dr. Aucejo said she could help set precedent for many others down the road.More than anything she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be.,Health
La Jolla California (CNN)To face each day Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.But last month as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla California hotel room she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different. She'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother her best friend and her pit bull Daisy who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant. A year earlier Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery."It's not for me and never has been" she said at the time. She was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it. A series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching however have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire 21 needs new lungs or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept. The only question is: Did her change of heart come too late? Feeling trappedIt wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.She had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13 she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14 she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way she nurtured a love of travel.She was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.Doctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst. "You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain" she remembered them saying. "And I was like 'OK I got the message! Copy that!' " She took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.Cystic fibrosis affects more than 30000 people in the United States (and more than 70000 worldwide) according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The disease causes an overabundance of mucus which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs complicates digestion affects the pancreas and other organs and eventually leads to respiratory failure. Read: Living while dying: 'Little Buddha' wisdom from a terminally ill 'goofball'The median survival age is about 40 according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare. Claire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes endured as best she could the feeding tube at night even though it made her throw up and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily she said she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day. But even with all of this her lung function continued to decline. In one year she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.CFers as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis often talk about "the Wheelchair Decision" with dread Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February it initially felt "like freedom." With her best friend Larissa taking on the role of "designated wheeler" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach where Claire lives visiting the canals going to the park soaking in the ocean breeze.And while most of the time she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair there are accessibility issues the sidewalks are a mess and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably she's had those moments when she thinks "It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far."Then Claire who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia. Though the portacath was fixable Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously."I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything" she remembered feeling with a panic. "I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die."Ready for the raceAfter leaving the La Jolla hotel Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team. She'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then she was eager to tell them why this time was different. A nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator Megan Serletti spent several hours educating Claire her mom and Larissa about the process. They talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list some of which Claire knew well and described as "gnarly." They discussed the lung allocation score the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.They discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center the importance of not ignoring phone calls the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule."We call a transplant your marathon" Serletti said. "We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race."There were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute? "I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money" Claire quipped. "Way to bring the hustle."How about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C a condition that is treatable?"Honestly I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else" she said. "I already have the body of someone who's been around the block." Serletti spoke of the realities after surgery including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life the physical and emotional challenges she might face the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor. Claire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up "Don't Panic" logo from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." "None of it spooked me" Claire said afterward over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. "Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything."'We both just started crying'To qualify for new lungs a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.  There were 1436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20 according to the United Network for Organ Sharing which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year of the total 2449 lung transplants performed CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients. A lung transplant is not a cure but it can extend a life if all goes well.Of those who received lung transplants (not just CFers) dating to 2000 an average of 84% survived after one year nearly 54% survived five years and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more according to the organ sharing network's data. Deciding to go for a lung transplant let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers) is no small matter. Claire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17 she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down her mom explained because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again at the very place she had returned to now when she was 19. While her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms she was being asked to contemplate her mortality. She prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did but her heart wasn't in it she said. She was still happy with what she had and as an adult able to make her own decisions.Her parents who split up when Claire was 3 struggled to make peace with her choice. "Just think of it as insurance even if you don't want to do it" her mother Melissa Nordquist Yeager pleaded at first. "Get on the list so you can change your mind."But ever since she'd been a small child Claire had a sense of self an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.Her dad John Wineland said Claire "has a relationship with her body that is sacred" and described his daughter's thinking: "This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with." And as her parent he said "I have to live with it."To see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind they were thrilled excited and terrified. "I was blown away so grateful happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up" remembered Yeager who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first. "I called her dad and we both just started crying" Yeager said."I'm just praying my ass off really that everything goes smoothly that she can get a shot at more time on the planet" Claire's dad said. "There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted."'Are you ready?'It's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.Fijolek who serves on the transplant team remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about "who are these [new] lungs going to live with" she said get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.Is Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?"How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?" Fijolek asked.Claire mentioned how her decline starting last fall threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days. Photos on a cell phone are passed around showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.Fijolek turned serious locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: "You know you need a transplant.""I was so young. I was so naïve" Claire answered describing where she was before. "All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed."Fijolek who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence pushed her further."Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time" she said. "Are you ready?"Claire assured her she is."It's a big change from where you were" the social worker said."I didn't want to waste anyone's time" Claire answered.Her mother sat by fanning herself with a medical brochure listened and wiped a tear from her eye.All she hadThe last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.Dr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood."Two days ago" she told him. "It's usually one or two times a month."He prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said "Your shoes will have to change."The doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed he explained.He asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats. Claire -- who used to do yoga six days a week loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had. For the first time that day her cheeks had color. "I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long" Afshar blurted out. Given her blood type and her condition he said she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.Claire's eyes opened wide and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly it seemed real."Three months!" Yeager said outside the center. "That made me want to throw up a little bit.""I'm a little overwhelmed" Claire said. "I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness."Hoping for a chanceThe truth is according to Claire not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well. She was able to "work with what I had in front of me" she said rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more. "If I had told myself things could be better than they are now I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives" she said. In changing her mind she said she had to swallow some of her pride and "open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried."A slew of tests still awaited Claire but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging. "For the first time ever I'm going there and it's really scary" she said. "Now that I actually want something better what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?"The pressure is on and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance. ,Health
 (CNN)In 2008 an Olympic year Lee Sweeney's phone was ringing nonstop. For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine that may be expected but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.The people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes. In the late 1990s Sweeney made headlines because of his research on "Schwarzenegger mice" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair. The main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.Word got out however that he was not interested.Ahead of this year's Commonwealth Games which started April 4 Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency."At the beginning when we first started publishing on this we did get contacted by high-level athletes" said Sweeney who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. "These days it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities."Back then gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.Responding promptly to the possibility in 2002 the anti-doping agency established "gene and cell-doping panels" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.In 2003 the organization banned "gene doping" which it defined as the "nontherapeutic use of cells genes genetic elements or modulation of gene expression having the capacity to enhance performance."This new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?Now almost 20 years later the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disorder hemophilia blindness cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles Sweeney said. "So because of that it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes."It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen" he said.Getting inside your genesIn the case of the "Schwarzenegger mice" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger. Genes are delivered into an organism using a "vector" the most common being viruses like that used by Sweeney which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and there unload the genetic material which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes. One example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin commonly known as EPO which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues. With the injection of external EPO elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.If extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery however it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.But the technology is not quite at that level yet."Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult" Sweeney said highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home. Another way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR or CRISPR-Cas9 a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing. The technique is rapidly developing leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its "gene-doping" ban to "gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression."The ban went into effect in January."There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9" Sweeney said. "One is to take cells from a person modify those cells and put them back into the person and that is probably the safest way to use it."The other way to use it which is to modify your existent DNA in the body is potentially very unsafe." Sweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases. In the case of gene-doping through gene therapies using vectors for delivery it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample such as blood said Olivier Rabin senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency. In particular Rabin said the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes he added."Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement he said.Rabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as "pretty good markers of gene manipulation" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.Asked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said "We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list."The question now is whether the first few cases have in fact happened without our knowledge.Modern occurrence "I never heard anything about it except for one time and it was around five years ago" said Sebastian Weber coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. "There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide. AICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production. In cycling for gene doping to be effective techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen. "Just because you have more oxygen it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it" Weber said.As AICAR was a drug it wasn't gene doping but it led people to wonder about what was next he says after this "first step" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. "That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping."Tailoring to your genesThere are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance by understanding their physiology. For example project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot the RugbyGene Project are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed. "We recognize it is not only genetic" said Dr. Alun Williams an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. "Training diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor."The researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season give longer rest periods reduce the number of matches played in a season or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.But Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. "This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic like the tendon injury is still a small bit of a bigger picture" he said. "So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context." A different point of viewSome experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not."Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances" said bioethicist Andy Miah the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of "Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics Gene Doping and Sport." "Even if it's not a world record it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do and often that is about transcending boundaries."We give athletes all sort of technology to do that added Miah who readily claims to "disagree with anti-doping."Instead of the current scenario in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement. "If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised then I think that is a much more safe and healthy.Nick Busca is a triathlon coach personal trainer and CNN sport and health contributor.,Health
 (CNN)Two years ago Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. "She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a "breakthrough therapy" -- meaning that it demonstrated "substantial improvement" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Still to recommend approval the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review Dr. Paul Andreason warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes including death at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing he said had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. While Tyne had heard about these risks he said he "discounted death as a real statistical possibility" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  "I have two young children who love their grandmother" he told the committee. "If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving funny caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please I beg you do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love." 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective Andreason said in his medical review though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations according to the hearing transcript. "I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this I think they're probably willing to take that risk" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a "plea" to the FDA to "consider a large observational study so we can ensure that once it goes into real-world use that the benefits will outweigh the risks."   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. "She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release patients' family members doctors and other health care professionals started reporting "adverse events" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths life-threatening incidents falls insomnia nausea and fatigue. In more than 1000 reports patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.In November an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization the Institute for Safe Medication Practices warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was "not providing the expected benefit" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA these so-called "adverse event reports" document deaths side effects and other issues and can be made directly by consumers caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label for instance or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports "reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good." Thomas Moore senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit said the deaths are an "important warning signal" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June Nuplazid was the only medication listed as "suspect" in at least 500 of the death reports. Physicians medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks."This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported" said Diana Zuckerman founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research adding that because reports are voluntary potential problems may be underreported. "You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously."Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease according to the FDA and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death which it is required to pass along to the FDA."If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported especially in an older chronically ill patient population" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its "benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted for example that since the drug's approval two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. "I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug" Jankovic said in the statement. "While not all patients are completely satisfied many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations paranoia and other psychotic symptoms." In an interview this week FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product he said he is "familiar with the circumstances" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is "appropriately balancing" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard however and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  "You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's "complex safety profile" recognized at the time of its approval resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far according to the FDA typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    "Based on these data the FDA has at this time not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe "black box" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid the researchers interviewed by CNN said the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that because the drug was already approved these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning a nurse noted that the woman was "sleepy." Shortly after she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and less than an hour after the nurse's visit she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was "related" to Nuplazid her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away she said she was told by "someone at the hospital" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there "is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid." Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug along with Medicare claims data. However multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30000 a year for a single patient though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    The company meanwhile is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population concerned medical experts told CNN.    "You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. "If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    "That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk."    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   "This is exactly what I thought was going to happen" he said. "We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths."  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that after previous studies didn't show it was effective the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used "consistent appropriate and validated assessment methodology.""If patients know there is some level of benefit they can judge their risk" said Fox-Rawlings. "But if we don't even know that it does work how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope."    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  "I remember leaving really really frustrated" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the "staggering cost" of the medication she said she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories however and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   "Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    "If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror."

 (CNN)For the past 20 years Hope Workman has hustled up a dirt path on the side of a mountain in Lovely Kentucky just to get drinking water. She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap. If she's by herself she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3½-foot PVC pipe. The day CNN visited the temperature was just above freezing and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water. "This is what we go through to get water unfortunately" she said. Workman is not the only person in Martin County Kentucky or America for that matter who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint Michigan's lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria. As our water infrastructure system ages experts say keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.According to the the society about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age they can crack and water breaks become more common. In fact the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes. For many cash-strapped local utilities it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see. Faucets run brownBut when the problem does come to the surface it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes it smells like diesel fuel. Locals ask themselves "Just what's in the water?"Until several months ago customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer. Eastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame. 'We're just scared of the water'Martin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water. "We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years" she said. "You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. "I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better but I don't feel any better about it." Dr. Don Lafferty a local physician feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. "I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. "We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region." Where the War on Poverty beganNestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015 the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate. But poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty. "In 2018 in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine" said Gary Ball editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper The Mountain Citizen. What's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country said Lindell Ormsbee director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.  "I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine" Ormsbee said. What is happening? A large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county placed up and over rocky terrain making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet. When water systems are operating optimally there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes there is suddenly room for soil debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water. And because of the leakage issues the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. "As far as systematic lines it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished." Burns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine. But on top of issues with the lines there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities pumps and meters that still need to be made. Investments in hardware and software are neededFor a financially struggling municipality it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income. Infrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management. Small water systems such as Martin County that serve less than 10000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country. In addition to  infrastructure and financial challenges many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016. Some citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. "Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries" Lafferty said. "We are Americans too."Ball points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez the county seat. The cost is nearly $20 million money that he said could have been spent on upgrading the water system.  Some reliefRecently Martin County received federal grants amounting to $3.4 million to go toward its water system. Experts believe that overhauling the system would take $13.5 million to $15 million. President Trump's infrastructure proposal gives some residents hope. The $1.5 trillion plan touted by the White House is supposed to cover all infrastructure upgrades in the nation but experts believe that it would cost the country $1 trillion just to maintain and meet the demands for drinking water for the next 25 years. Critics further point out the White House's plan earmarks only $200 billion in federal investment. The remainder is to be made up by the states and the private sector. "Time will tell" Lafferty said. "Politicians should remember that 'forgotten people' usually have long memories."

 (CNN)They're not slumped over in alleyways with used needles by their sides. Their dignity at least from outside appearances remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high. They are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs pay the bills and fool their families. For some addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.What addicts have in common according to experts is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill for example and never crave it again.This is a story about the others those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now experts explain can easily and lethally be derailed. Hanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who for the benefit of everyone's understanding want to be heard. After CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row the sorts we think of when we picture "heroin addict" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story. Being a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up. 'All smiles and happiness at work'Loving and successful parents good schools a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then at 15 he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery. "The feeling in my head was 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life' " Todd says. "It was the perfect drug for me."The 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26 he has gone stretches where he's been sober but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back. He's done heroin for periods of time and says it's "fantastic" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference assuming he can find them is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and if he can't get that Subutex. He makes good money which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit. He's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana. "I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1000" he says. "There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better." To avoid that hell Todd often lives a lie. He's "all smiles and happiness at work" he says and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off. But death is very much a reality in his life.His last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction. He'd like to find love build a relationship and have a family but says "It would be dishonest and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem."He knows that he has a lot to live for but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely. "I've always wanted to see the world" he says. "I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison." The sign of an addictThe sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life was the giveaway. He like 10% or 15% of people has the disease of addiction explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. What offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem says Gitlow is that "you don't know in advance what person you're going to be."Todd may be functioning now but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?"They all start out functioning" he says. "The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying." What Todd needs Gitlow says is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority or 80% of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well he says.Not a unique storyIt didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12 when she began cutting herself. Carving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain giving her a high she says. The first time she did it she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.Now at 23 Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used "I hurt myself a lot less." The difference now is that she like Todd no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning she insists "I just do enough to stay well" through the day and not feel physical pain. She works hard always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school where she was dubbed "gifted and talented" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.How she found heroin she says is not unique. Long plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief as did deep-tissue massage. Finally four years ago a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills. She found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions she says effectively ending her lawful pain management. Once her pills ran out she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find though and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend a heroin user suggested that she give his drug a try."I can't find pills I'm in pain and it's really cheap" she remembers telling herself. "What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people."Where she lives in Texas near the Mexican border the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50 but she can get half a gram of heroin which is far more potent for $20. The same product she says would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country. "If I moved somewhere where it was $100" she says "I'd quit."Her husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan the overdose antidote drug in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses."He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me" Lisa says. "That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end." Lisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else her family included believes she's hooked on "just pills." It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment."People drink and we think nothing of it. You do heroin and you're the scum of the earth" she says. "People will cut you out of their lives." Everybody's problemHeroin users weren't always "the scum of the earth." In the late 19th century it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer. Today there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't and much of that is rooted in racism says Dr. Michael Miller who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. White socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it he says but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it the perception changed and stuck.Now with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative it's become everybody's problem -- white or black rich or poor on the coasts or in middle America no matter whether you live in a city suburb or rural community. That's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret. She admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then? "She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge" Gitlow says. "What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead."  'Like downing a beer'Not everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew. For as long as Matthew can remember he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD he says. An arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew 28 first tried oxycodone. Later a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain a condition he's had for six years. It's the sort of pain he says that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.Raised in the Eastern US he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications. It's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse. He's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take. "It's similar to a dose of Percocet." he says. "The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail." He doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out."I just don't find sober me is the best me" he says. Having a secret can be isolating he says but otherwise heroin has not hindered his life. Rather Matthew says "It's changed my life for the better." Not only does it help with the pain he says it constipates him allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.  "I'm dependent" he says. "But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict."  The crippling truthMatthew is kidding himself experts say."Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease" Gitlow said. "Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component." Starting at 19 the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than "conventional coping mechanisms" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.Matthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem Gitlow says is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.  Plus using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry says Siobhan Morse director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network. The natural way a body manages pain or stress Morse says is by producing endorphins."If you're giving it the artificial substance" she explains the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. "So when you take away the artificial substance everything is so painful." And for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse Morse adds. She describes the combination as a "moving target."Eventually she and other experts say Matthew's drug use will catch up with him."I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict" Morse says. The fall of 'Superwoman'Rebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.She grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled."I didn't have any boundaries" says Rebecca 59. "I could do whatever I wanted which was a recipe for disaster."Starting at 12 she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15 the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin. "I was in love" she says of the drug. "It became the love of my life."One day she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks. "Mom didn't bat an eye" Rebecca remembers. Instead she shrugged it off saying "Jewish people aren't addicts." Her father when he was around was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes she says. Rebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.Divorced and 24 Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help. Along the way she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose. Rebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart so did she. "That was when I started to spiral down" Rebecca says. "As soon as I started using it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using."Even as Rebecca returned to heroin spending $100 or more a day she built a career in corporate travel working for big-name companies."As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick I was like Superwoman" she says of her job performance. "If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict people would have laughed." Years of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30000 mistake at work got her fired."People kept saying 'You're going to die' " Rebecca says. "The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die it's that I was going to live." Her kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the "nasty places" she called home. "It was just awful" says Rebecca who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed. Today Rebecca is three years sober. The last time she entered treatment she says "something clicked and I remember thinking 'I can't do this anymore.' "She was "sick and tired of being sick and tired" she says. "I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high." Rebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic another is also a heroin addict and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills. "It's in the genes" Rebecca says. "No doubt."She has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community. "If there's any regret it's that I've missed decades" Rebecca says. "I just thought I wasn't going to live so I never worried about getting old."  She is fighting to make the rest of her life matter all the while knowing -- based on decades of experience -- how easily she could slip again. One lapse one moment of weakness or overconfidence that she can handle it and everything Rebecca is building up could come crashing down and quite possibly bury her.,Health
 (CNN)As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes the more money he or she makes.  In 2014 and 2015 opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25000 during that time.Physicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid. "This is the first time we've seen this and it's really important" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative. "It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics and that's very disturbing" said Kolodny who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. The Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers. "I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money but in either case it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value" said Dr. Michael Barnett assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. CNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives. Carey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids it must be because they were the best option for her pain. Then she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years. "Once I found out he was being paid I thought 'was it really in my best interest or was it in his best interest?' " she said. To do the analysis CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients. The CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015 during which time more than 811000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.  Fifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.Doctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money. Among doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.On average doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1% on average received nine times more money than the typical doctor. "The correlation you found is very powerful" said David Rothman director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. "What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more." Paying doctors for speaking consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications but it has long been a controversial practice.   Pharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment.  It's illegal however for doctors to prescribe the drug in exchange for kickback payments from a manufacturer.  Dr. Steven Stanos president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.  "They know those medicines and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding" Stanos said adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new "abuse-deterrent" opioid drugs.  Stanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017 according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  Stanos said the money was used for various projects including courses on safe opioid prescribing.  "I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient" he said. But Dr. Daniel Carlat former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits. "It's not proof positive but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care" said Carlat a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. "It makes me extremely concerned." Barnett one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.  "It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether" he said. "They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective."  According to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.  "PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing" according to the statement from the group. 'I trusted my doctor' Angela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment. She says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah a pain specialist in Greenville South Carolina prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2½ years from March 2013 through July 2015.  Subsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "He said it would do wonders for me and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth" Cantone said. She says Subsys helped her pain but it left her in "a zombie-like" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children two of whom have autism and other special needs.  "I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn" she said. She says that if she missed even one day of the drug she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.  She said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.  "I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out" she said.  She says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication he became belligerent. "He said it was Subsys or nothing" she said. Cantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016 the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200000 according to Open Payments the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors. CNN compared the $190000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.Nearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking training education and consulting. Cantone is now suing Thiyagarajah accusing him of setting out to "defraud and deceive" her for "the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions sales and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits." Through his attorney Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation. In a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was "reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care." His attorney E. Brown Parkinson said the doctor is currently practicing medicine alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York. Thiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.  But he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.  In 2014 and 2015 physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah however annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.After about two years on Subsys Cantone says she took herself off the drug cold turkey. According to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid buprenorphine "for non-legitimate medical need" in violation of federal law. In March 2016 the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys. The DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services according to Robert Murphy associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.  Cantone is also suing Insys the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.  Separate from Cantone's lawsuit John Kapoor the founder and largest shareholder of Insys was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug. "Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms" said Tom Becker a spokesman for Kapoor. "He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court."  Kapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October according to a company news release.  Several other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.  Separately Sen. Claire McCaskill a Democrat from Missouri is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry. According to her investigation and the federal indictment Insys used a combination of tactics such as falsifying medical records misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.  Saeed Motahari president and CEO of Insys wrote a letter in September to McCaskill noting that he was "concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees." He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.  "I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country" Motahari added.  The analysis Sometimes pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.  Among the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category which includes speaking fees consulting travel and food. Concerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.  Several studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits. For example researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients. "This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer" the authors concluded. Some studies have looked at whether the amount of money a doctor receives makes a difference. Studies by researchers at Yale University the George Washington University Milken Institute of Public Health and Harvard Medical School have all found that the more money physicians are paid by pharmaceutical companies the more likely they are to prescribe certain drugs. Dr. Patrice Harris a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association said that the CNN and Harvard data raised "fair questions" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other. It's "not a cause and effect relationship" said Harris chairwoman of the association's opioid task force adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions. "[We] strongly oppose inappropriate unethical interactions between physicians and industry" she added. "But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate."   Harris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they "can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients."  Stanos the pain physician said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient. "I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit" he said. But Jena one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.  "Every decision every recommendation a physician makes should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor" said Jena associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.  "If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred  how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?" he asked.  From 1999 to 2015 more than 183000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids according to the CDC. In October President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency. At least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.  Purdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla another opioid in November according to company spokesman Robert Josephson."We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers" a company statement said.  More than $1 million in three years Though Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs. Several patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers. From August 2013 through December 2016 Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park Kansas was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers according to the federal Open Payments database. Most of the payments were fees for speaking training and education. Ballou one of his patients says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors. "He said he was going to Miami and they were going to give him a convertible and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had" said Ballou who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.  Simon's lawyer James Wyrsch said he would not comment on pending litigation.  In court documents he asked for the case to be dismissed saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were "simply incorrect."  Bridget Patton a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office said federal agents went to the office where Simon works Mid-America PolyClinic in July. The clinic said in a statement that it is "fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24. "We had a lawful presence at that facility" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit. The owner of the pain clinic Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions. Simon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation. Ballou said that when she was Simon's patient it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs. But now she looks back with anger. Cantone the patient who went to Thiyagarajah the pain specialist in South Carolina looks back with sadness.  She cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.  Her card said her mother liked to sleep.  "Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park' it was the years of her finding me on the floor" Cantone said. "I feel like I failed as a parent." She becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.  "The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit not my own" she said.CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this story.

 (CNN)California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna."If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law" he said.Aetna the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers told CNN it looked forward to "explaining our clinical review process" to the commissioner.The California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015 according to the insurer. During the deposition the doctor said he was following Aetna's training in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him. Jones said his expectation would be "that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests" and that it's troubling that "during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna he never once looked at patients' medical records himself." "It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician as opposed to some other licensed professional" Jones told CNN. "That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation."The insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office.Members of the medical community expressed similar shock saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country."Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors."This is potentially a huge huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions" said Dr. Andrew Murphy who like Irani is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.The Gillen Washington caseThe deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court. Gillen Washington 23 is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's "reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him."Aetna has rejected the allegations saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency or CVID in high school became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser. Aetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion which can cost up to $20000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.Despite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.Once his blood was tested Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that according to Aetna Washington continued to miss infusions.Washington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary "to prevent acute and long-term problems.""Aetna is blaming me for what happened" Washington told CNN. "I'll just be honest it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change."During his videotaped deposition in October 2016 Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.Questioned about Washington's condition Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.Iinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient."Do I know what happens?" the doctor said. "Again I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it."Iinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off "pertinent information" provided to him by a nurse."Did you ever look at medical records?" Scott Glovsky Washington's attorney asked Iinuma in the deposition."No I did not" the doctor says shaking his head."So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?" Glovsky asks."Correct."Iinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while he said he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.How many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?"Zero to one" he said.Glovsky told CNN he had "never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors."Aetna's responseAetna defended Iinuma who is no longer with the company saying in its legal brief that he relied on his "years of experience" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately."Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct" Aetna said in court papers. "Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts." In its trial brief Aetna said: "Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations."In addition to applying their clinical judgment the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated and are publicly available for any treating physician to review."Jones the California insurance commissioner said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records."What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director he wasn't actually reviewing medical records" Jones told CNN.He said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine "whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician."If the probe determines that violations occurred he said California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.CNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson an attorney representing Aetna declined to answer any questions. Asked about the California investigation Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:"We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process."Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process medical directors are provided all submitted medical records and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.  "Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process."'A huge admission'Dr. Arthur Caplan founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center described Iinuma's testimony as "a huge admission of fundamental immorality.""People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients" Caplan said adding the testimony shows there "needs to be more transparency and accountability" from private for-profit insurers in making these decisions.Murphy the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member said he was "shocked" and "flabbergasted" by the medical director's admission. "This is something that all of us have long suspected but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records that's not good" said Murphy who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia."If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah you'd have to question every single case he reviewed." Murphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.  "We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements" he said."Dealing with these denials is very time consuming. A great deal of nursing time is spent filling and refilling out paperwork trying to get the patient treatment."If that does not work then physicians need to get involved and demand medical director involvement which may or may not occur in a timely fashion -- or sometimes not at all" he said. "It's very frustrating.",Health
 (CNN)Two years ago Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.  She could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease. "She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her" he told an FDA advisory committee. He believed that a new medication called Nuplazid made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals was the answer.  Nuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a "breakthrough therapy" -- meaning that it demonstrated "substantial improvement" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.  Still to recommend approval the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients. Some FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.  But the physician who led the FDA's medical review Dr. Paul Andreason warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes including death at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing he said had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks. While Tyne had heard about these risks he said he "discounted death as a real statistical possibility" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.  "I have two young children who love their grandmother" he told the committee. "If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving funny caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please I beg you do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love." 'You have to take it seriously' The committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients. Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective Andreason said in his medical review though they showed similar risk.    Even some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations according to the hearing transcript. "I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this I think they're probably willing to take that risk" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a "plea" to the FDA to "consider a large observational study so we can ensure that once it goes into real-world use that the benefits will outweigh the risks."   It hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017. Tyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. "She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all" he said.   Shortly after the drug's release patients' family members doctors and other health care professionals started reporting "adverse events" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths life-threatening incidents falls insomnia nausea and fatigue. In more than 1000 reports patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.In November an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization the Institute for Safe Medication Practices warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was "not providing the expected benefit" or potentially worsening the condition. Tracked by the FDA these so-called "adverse event reports" document deaths side effects and other issues and can be made directly by consumers caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug. An adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label for instance or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.    After analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports "reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good." Thomas Moore senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit said the deaths are an "important warning signal" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action depending on what the review finds.Since the institute released its analysis FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June Nuplazid was the only medication listed as "suspect" in at least 500 of the death reports. Physicians medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks."This is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported" said Diana Zuckerman founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research adding that because reports are voluntary potential problems may be underreported. "You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously."Acadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease according to the FDA and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.   Acadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death which it is required to pass along to the FDA."If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported especially in an older chronically ill patient population" the company said in a statement.Read Acadia's full response here    It said its "benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted for example that since the drug's approval two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.  The company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. "I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug" Jankovic said in the statement. "While not all patients are completely satisfied many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations paranoia and other psychotic symptoms." In an interview this week FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product he said he is "familiar with the circumstances" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is "appropriately balancing" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard however and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.  "You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known" he said.The FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's "complex safety profile" recognized at the time of its approval resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.    The cases reported so far according to the FDA typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.    "Based on these data the FDA has at this time not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling" the agency said in a statement.   The FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe "black box" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.    Related: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.    To determine the true risks of Nuplazid the researchers interviewed by CNN said the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that because the drug was already approved these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.   Hundreds of adverse event reports A CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.   In these reports the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.  One report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning a nurse noted that the woman was "sleepy." Shortly after she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and less than an hour after the nurse's visit she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was "related" to Nuplazid her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.    Related: Sick dying and raped in America's nursing homesIn another report an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away she said she was told by "someone at the hospital" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.      Acadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there "is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid." Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug along with Medicare claims data. However multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.   Widening the patient pool In the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.   Currently Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank. That can add up to more than $30000 a year for a single patient though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.   Acadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.    The company meanwhile is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process. While a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population concerned medical experts told CNN.    "You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. "If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much much larger -- that would be unconscionable.    "That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk."    'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up' Roughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.Andreason the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid no longer works for the agency. He said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.  He said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.   "This is exactly what I thought was going to happen" he said. "We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths."  Dr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that after previous studies didn't show it was effective the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used "consistent appropriate and validated assessment methodology.""If patients know there is some level of benefit they can judge their risk" said Fox-Rawlings. "But if we don't even know that it does work how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope."    Kim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.  "I remember leaving really really frustrated" she said.    CNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.   One of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the "staggering cost" of the medication she said she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories however and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.  The other person was Tyne. The 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid but he still gets frustrated talking about it.   "Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up" he said.  But he doesn't regret trying.    "If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror."

 (CNN)I often tell people to steer clear of alcoholic beverages when trying to lose weight. After all they don't exactly provide nutritious calories and consuming them can make it increasingly more challenging to lose weight.  But that doesn't stop people from asking me "what is the best drink to have on a diet?"   Clearly some alcoholic beverages are more waistline-friendly than others. So the short answer is: If you're looking to shed pounds some of your lowest-calorie bets are a shot of spirits (for example a 1.5-ounce shot of vodka gin rum whiskey or tequila contains an average of 97 calories) a glass of champagne (about 84 calories per 4 ounces); a glass of dry wine (approximately 120 to 125 calories per 5 ounces) or a traditional martini with an average of 124 calories for a 2.5-ounce serving.  A light beer (approximately 100 calories) or a glass of reduced-calorie wine (about 90 to 100 calories) are other lower-calorie options.But if you want to know why some alcoholic beverages contain more calories than others read on.Pure alcohol contains 7 calories per gram -- that's less than a gram of fat which has 9 calories but more than protein and carbs which have 4 calories per gram each -- but other variables of your drink influence the calorie count. The amount of alcohol the total volume of a beverage the amount of carbohydrates and sugars and mixers all play a role.Generally speaking the biggest difference in calories in beverages comes from the alcohol content but the presence of carbohydrates in alcoholic beverages also contributes largely to its calories according to Dwayne Bershaw who teaches winemaking classes in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University.  Any carbohydrates in wine consist of small amounts of sugar which may either be left over from the original grape sugar after most of it ferments into alcohol or added from grape juice or some other source in order to balance the acidity of the wine.  Unless we're talking about a dessert wine this amount of sugar is generally small and does not contribute a significant amount of calories to wine.Beer is made from grain which stores carbohydrates in the form of starch -- specifically large branched sugar molecules which are chopped into pieces by naturally occurring enzymes in malted barley during the brewing process. The smallest sugar pieces are converted to alcohol by yeast but some larger pieces remain that cannot be broken down by yeast according to Bershaw. These remaining carbohydrates contribute to the overall calorie count for most beers.Generally beer has more calories than wine but the calorie difference in the two primarily comes from the leftover carbohydrates in beer as the sugar content for most wines is fairly low.Low-calorie beers have an additional enzyme added during the brewing or fermentation process and it breaks down all of the starch molecules into simple sugars so there are no remaining carbohydrates. These beers also have a relatively low alcohol content to keep the total calorie count quite low according to Bershaw.And generally spirits -- including vodka tequila rum and gin  -- do not contain any carbohydrates or sugars. Some producers may add small amounts of sugar to combat any perceived bitterness according to Bershaw but like wine this small amount would not bump the calorie count much. Though they have higher alcohol by volume (up to 40% or more) the volume of a standard shot is small (1.5 ounces) making them a relatively lower-calorie option -- that is as long as you can stick to one shot or mix it with a zero-calorie beverage like a diet cola soda water or seltzer.Other ingredients -- including mixers tonic water juice soda syrups cream and coconut -- all pack sugar and fat calories on top of alcohol and should be consumed with caution explained Ginger Hultin a registered dietitian spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and author of the blog ChampagneNutrition.  "Margaritas and pina coladas can have close to 500 calories per drink depending on the size and how it's made and could be a real challenge for anyone with a weight loss goal" Hultin added.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. ,Health
 (CNN)You're out late at night and you've had one too many drinks. You're feeling a bit inebriated and you're wondering if a cup of coffee can help. Many of us have been there.Well here's the lowdown: While a cup of joe or shot of espresso can help to perk you up it's not going to help sober you up. In fact in some situations the combination of caffeine and alcohol could be potentially harmful. "I call it the 'perfect storm' " said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien senior associate dean for health care education at the Wake Forest School of Medicine who has researched the interactions between caffeine and alcohol including its effects on injury risk. How alcohol and caffeine are metabolized Caffeine is a stimulant so it can make you more alert and possibly improve your performance to some extent according to Dr. Robert Swift associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addition Studies. Specifically caffeine interferes with the action of a chemical known as adenosine. "Adenosine tends to be sedative ... and one of the signals to fall asleep is that adenosine builds up in the brain" Swift said. By blocking the action of adenosine caffeine has the ability to make you feel less tired Swift explained. Interestingly alcohol can trigger the release of dopamine which results in a stimulant effect when you first start drinking though this does not necessarily mean you are any less impaired from alcohol according to Swift.Alcohol's sedative effects tend to kick in after blood alcohol levels peak and then start to fall. Specifically alcohol promotes the release of the brain chemical GABA which produces sedation Swift explained. Alcohol also blocks the action of glutamate a brain chemical that stimulates nerve cells and this blockade can also produce sedation. During this time you might feel tired and in need of a pick-me-up. Alcohol and caffeine: A potentially dangerous combinationConsuming caffeine might make you feel less sleepy when drinking alcohol but it will not accelerate alcohol metabolism or ameliorate its effects experts say. Mixing the two is also a practice that the US Dietary Guidelines cautions against. A major concern when seeking out coffee or any source of caffeine in an effort to feel awake after a few drinks is that by making you feel less tired you may think you are less inebriated than you actually are. "Even if someone feels like the caffeine causes them to feel more awake and less sluggish they still need to be aware that the alcohol is still metabolizing in the same way and on the same timeframe as if they haven't had any caffeine ... which means that its effects can still be potentially dangerous" said Melissa Majumdar a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."Someone may think 'I can drive now' ... they see a car stop suddenly and they have to put their foot on the brake quickly but reaction time could be slow" Swift said. "What you feel is [linked to] a different part of your brain that is the motor system that controls reaction time.""Your blood alcohol concentration won't be reversed by caffeine" Swift added. That means people feel less tired from alcohol when they drink coffee "but they are not any less impaired" Swift explained.In one study involving close to 130 adult drinkers alcohol negatively affected reaction time and resulted in more crashes during a simulated driving test but drinking caffeinated beer didn't improve people's ability to drive. In addition to the fact that consuming caffeine while drinking won't make you any sharper behind the wheel there also is no evidence that consuming caffeine while drinking would improve your judgment in social situations according to Swift. What's more by making you feel less tired or sedated you may be inclined to consume more alcohol than you otherwise would. "If you take caffeine with your alcohol people drink more" Swift said. "The usual signal where people would say 'I've had enough' is no longer there.""Caffeine permits you to stay awake longer than you would have otherwise -- and therefore drink for a longer amount of time" O'Brien added. "I had the experience of taking care of a young man who was extremely intoxicated and almost on a ventilator ... he said had been drinking Red Bull and Jägermeister. When I asked why he was mixing alcohol and caffeine he said 'So I can stay drunk longer' " O'Brien said.The marketing and sale of premixed beverages containing alcohol and caffeine has been particularly concerning among experts. But there has been a positive outcome: O'Brien's research examining injury associated with these caffeinated malt beverages (dubbed "AEDs or "alcoholic energy drinks") contributed to the successful removal of these beverages from the market in 2010. "The FDA put the kibosh on that because of the negative public health implications" Swift said. Strategies for sobering upExperts say the only way to sober up is to let time pass. The specific time it will take for alcohol to leave your system depends on the individual but on average people metabolize about one drink per hour. "If you've had five drinks it would take about five hours to get the alcohol totally out of your system" Swift said.But an even better strategy is to prevent intoxication in the first place. Experts say drinking with food in your stomach can slow the rise of alcohol in your bloodstream which can make you less impaired than if you drank on an empty stomach. Alternating alcoholic beverages with seltzer or water is another helpful strategy. It won't slow the absorption of alcohol in the body or make you less inebriated but "water will help keep one hydrated ... and can potentially decrease the amount of alcohol someone drinks" Majumdar said.

 (CNN)Have you ever wondered why some people seem to stay trim effortlessly while the majority of Americans struggle with their weight? Sure genetics and a healthy lifestyle play a large role but there are other more surprising correlations that may be helping them stay slim. They live near a gym.A recent study in the journal Lancet Public Health found that people living within a kilometer (a little more than half a mile) of physical activity facilities -- including gyms swimming pools and playing fields -- weighed less and had smaller waists than those who didn't. The difference was greater in women and those with higher incomes. The study was observational so it does not prove cause and effect but it does reinforce the impact of the built environment including city design on body weight. Other research has found that more walkable neighborhoods are also associated with lower weight. The Lancet study also found an effect albeit weaker on proximity to fast food restaurants: Study subjects who lived 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) or farther from a fast food outlet versus within half a kilometer (a third of a mile) were slimmer especially women.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: A new way to track weight loss and more with these smart scalesThey fidget a lot.A review article nearly a decade ago found that people with the highest levels of spontaneous physical activity including fidgeting tend to weigh less. Although fidgeting has a strong genetic and biological component  increasing non-exercise-related physical activity -- including walking standing cooking and even gardening -- can also play a significant role in keeping people trim. This type of non-exercise activity makes up a significant and modifiable portion of your total daily calorie burning and it can play an important role in helping you stay lean. It is even more important in our modern environment filled with labor-saving devices televisions and technology. A 2003 study found that the impact of mechanization and labor-saving devices including dishwashers washing machines escalators and cars utilized in driving to work led to a 111-calorie reduction in daily energy expenditure. Unless this reduction is offset by increased activity it could lead to significant weight gain over time.They eat spicy food.If you pay closer attention you may notice that your naturally slim friends are the ones dousing their meals with extra-spicy hot sauce or eating hot chili peppers regularly. This may not be a coincidence. Observational data show that eating spicier foods is associated with less obesity. A recent review article summarizes the growing body of research showing that capsaicin a major bioactive compound present in chili peppers may play a role in weight control in several ways including reducing appetite activating heat-generating and calorie-burning brown fat increasing the use of fat as fuel and modestly increasing metabolism. In addition spicy food seems to keep people healthier. A very large Chinese study found that those who ate spicy food six to seven times per week versus once or less per week were 14% less likely to die from any cause. Numerous other spices including cumin ginger rosemary oregano cinnamon and turmeric may also play a role in helping you stay slim by reducing inflammation improving your body's response to insulin and improving the composition of bacteria in your gut. (I should disclose that I wrote about weight and health benefits of spices including spice-filled recipes in my new book "Spice Up Slim Down").They live at a higher elevation.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Colorado has the lowest rate of obesity in the United States and there may be a good reason why: the altitude. A 2013 article in the International Journal of Obesity found lower obesity rates in those living at higher elevations. Both men and women living at less than 500 meters (1640 feet) above sea level had a 5.1 and 3.9 times respectively higher odds of being obese compared with their counterparts living at 3000 meters (9800 feet) or greater above sea level after controlling for demographics and lifestyle. Those living at 1000 meters (3280 feet) had more modest but still significant 7.5% lower odds of being obese. The study's authors suggest that lower oxygen levels higher metabolic demands at higher altitudes and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system (which may reduce appetite) are all possible causes of this finding but a definitive explanation has yet to be fully established.They live in a big city.The study that looked at elevation and weight also found that people who lived in big cities defined as metro counties with a population of 1 million or greater had a significantly lower risk of obesity compared with those living in smaller metro non-metro or rural counties. The authors suggest that food security increased walkability of larger metro areas and better diet may explain these findings. But their conclusions are contradicted by other studies that have shown urbanization may lead to obesity especially in children and low-income populations.According to the Harvard School for Public Health this is probably due to increased access to high-calorie foods (especially fast food) more passive transportation (less walking) less open space more mass media marketing of unhealthy foods and less work-related physical activity. But even if you don't fall into those categories ...I don't expect you to move to the mountains of Nepal to stay slim but spicing up your diet and making an effort to move more on a daily basis could certainly help. And if you don't live in a big city or near an exercise facility a healthy lifestyle -- including daily exercise less sedentary behavior better sleep and a healthful diet -- will help keep you lean regardless of your environment.

 (CNN)You may be aware that a plant-based diet can make you healthier by lowering your risk for obesity heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. Now a study suggests there's another good reason to regularly eat meatless meals. By filling your plate with plant foods instead of animal foods you can help save the planet.The study published last week in the journal Nature found that as a result of population growth and the continued consumption of Western diets high in red meats and processed foods the environmental pressures of the food system could increase by up to 90% by 2050 "exceeding key planetary boundaries that define a safe operating space for humanity beyond which Earth's vital ecosystems could become unstable" according to study author Marco Springmann of the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food at the University of Oxford."It could lead to dangerous levels of climate change with higher occurrences of extreme weather events affect the regulatory function of forest ecosystems and biodiversity ... and pollute water bodies such that it would lead to more oxygen-depleted dead zones in oceans" Springmann said."If the whole world which continues to grow eats more like us the impacts are staggering and the planet simply can't withstand it" said Sharon Palmer a registered dietitian nutritionist and plant-based food and sustainability expert in Los Angeles who was not involved in the new research. Sustaining a healthier planet will require halving the amount of food loss and waste and improving farming practices and technologies. But it will also require a shift toward more plant-based diets according to Springmann. As Palmer noted "research consistently shows that drastically reducing animal food intake and mostly eating plant foods is one of the most powerful things you can do to reduce your impact on the planet over your lifetime in terms of energy required land used greenhouse gas emissions water used and pollutants produced."How a meat-based diet negatively affects the environment It might come as a surprise but Springmann's study found that the production of animal products generates the majority of food-related greenhouse-gas emissions -- specifically up to 78% of total agricultural emissions. This he explained is due to manure-related emissions to their "low feed-conversion efficiencies" (meaning cows and other animals are not efficient in converting what they eat into body weight) and to enteric fermentation in ruminants a process that takes place in a cow's stomach when it digests food that leads to methane emissions. The feed-related impacts of animal products also contribute to freshwater use and pressures on cropland as well as nitrogen and phosphorus application which over time could lead to dead zones in oceans low-oxygen areas where few organisms can survive according to Springmann.For an example of how animal foods compare with plant-based foods in terms of environmental effects consider that "beef is more than 100 times as emissions-intensive as legumes" Springmann said. "This is because a cow needs on average 10 kilograms of feed often from grains to grow 1 kilogram of body weight and that feed will have required water land and fertilizer inputs to grow." In addition cows emit the potent greenhouse gas methane during digestion which makes cows and other ruminants such as sheep especially high-emitting. Other animal foods have lower impacts because they don't produce methane in their stomachs and require less feed than cows Springmann explained. For example cows emit about 10 times more greenhouse gases per kilogram of meat than pigs and chickens which themselves emit about 10 times more than legumes.Like animals plants also require inputs from the environment in order to grow but the magnitude is significantly less Springmann explained."In today's agricultural system we grow plants to feed animals which require all of those resources and inputs: land water fossil fuels pesticides herbicides and fertilizer to grow. And then we feed plants to animals and care for them over their lifetime while they produce methane and manure" Palmer said.Adopting more plant-based diets for ourselves could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the food system by more than half according to the Nature study. A mainly plant-based diet could also reduce other environmental impacts such as those from fertilizers and save up to quarter use of both farmland and fresh water according to Springmann.Palmer explained that "legumes [or pulses] such as beans lentils and peas are the most sustainable protein source on the planet. They require very small amounts of water to grow they can grow in harsh dry climates they grow in poor nations providing food security and they act like a natural fertilizer capturing nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the soil. Thus there is less need for synthetic fertilizers. These are the types of protein sources we need to rely upon more often."Flexitarian: The healthy compromise for you and the planetExperts agree that if you are not ready to give up meat entirely a flexitarian diet which is predominantly plant-based can help. This diet includes plenty of fruits vegetables and plant-based protein sources including legumes soybeans and nuts along with modest amounts of poultry fish milk and eggs and small amounts of red meat. Vegetarian and vegan diets would result in even lower greenhouse gas emissions but a flexitarian diet "is the least stringent that is both healthy and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough for us to stay within environmental limits" according to Springmann.Palmer said that "although vegan diets followed by vegetarian diets are linked with the lowest environmental impacts not everyone is interested in taking on those lifestyles. But everyone can eat more of a flexitarian diet. It doesn't mean that you have to give up meat completely but you significantly reduce your intake of it." Registered dietitian nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner described it this way: "A flexitarian is really someone who wakes up with the intention of being more vegetarian. It's different from vegetarian in that there is some flexibility."Going flexitarian Just how "flexitarian" you wish to be can be flexible too. For example Blatner who was not involved in the Nature study offers three levels of the diet in her book "The Flexitarian Diet": a "beginner" flexitarian who consumes six to eight meatless meals per week (or is limited to 26 ounces of animal protein); an "advanced" flexitarian who eats nine to 14 meatless meals per week (or is limited to 18 ounces of animal protein); and an "expert" flexitarian who eats at least 15 meatless meals or limits animal protein to 9 ounces per week.The key is not just eliminating meat but swapping in plant-based proteins including beans and lentils. A Mediterranean meal might incorporate chickpeas; a Mexican meal might have black beans or pintos; an Asian meal might include edamame; an Italian meal might use white beans or lentils to make a "Bolognese" pasta sauce Blatner explained."I wrote the book because I really wanted to be a vegetarian but I just couldn't do it so strictly" she said. "I really wanted to lean in to a more plant-based diet but I needed a little more flexibility. So it's the great compromise." Flexitarian fast-startTo get started on a flexitarian diet here's a sample three-day plan courtesy of Blatner. You'll notice that some meals have a choice of a plant-based protein or an animal-based protein. Choose plant as often as you can and you'll soon be an expert-level flexitarian of 15-plus meatless meals per week.Day 1Breakfast of avocado toast: sprouted whole-grain toast + avocado + spinach + eggLunch of kale ranch bowl: chicken or chickpeas + chopped kale/tomatoes + roasted sweet potato cubes + ranch dressingDinner of tacos: seasoned white fish or lentils + corn tortillas + cabbage slaw + guacamole + salsaSnack of apple + pecans and/or cucumber + hummusDay 2Breakfast of peanut butter oatmeal: oatmeal + natural peanut butter + chopped appleLunch of a Mexican bowl: chicken or black beans + chopped romaine/peppers + brown rice + guacamole + salsaDinner of a Mediterranean plate: chicken or chickpeas + cucumber/tomato/feta salad + lemon-dill brown riceSnack of grape tomatoes + mozzarella stick and/or clementine + pistachiosDay 3Breakfast of green belly smoothie: 2% plain kefir + rolled oats + banana + spinachLunch of Asian bowl: chicken or edamame + coleslaw mix + quinoa + ginger dressingDinner of burgers: beef or bean burger + sweet potato fries + veggie dippers with ranchSnack of carrots + almond butter and/or dark chocolate + berriesLisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor. ,Health
 (CNN)Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease a study of more than 400000 adults in China suggests.  Daily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease which manifests as heart attacks and strokes compared with adults who avoided eggs according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.Commonly called heart disease cardiovascular disease includes heart failure arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure carrying too much weight or obesity and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease which is triggered by unhealthy diet physical inactivity smoking and harmful use of alcohol.'Controversial' nutrition sourceIn the past doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs. Though eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components they also have high amounts of cholesterol which was thought might be harmful explained Canqing Yu a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.  Yet "existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population "which have huge differences in dietary habits lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns" Yu said.These are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease. To begin they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer cardiovascular disease or diabetes.Slightly more than 13% of these adults ranging in age from 30 to 79 said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken not duck eggs Yu noted.Over nearly nine years the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events such as heart attacks and strokes including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due usually to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked usually by a blood clot.  "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China which accounted for half of the total mortality" Yu said. "Stroke including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is the first cause of premature death followed by ischemic heart disease."During follow-up 9985 people died of cardiovascular disease and an additional 5103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.Analyzing the data the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.In fact participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries.  Additionally the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.Finally egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.  Based on the results Yu said eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more the new research is "by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect" he said.On the downside the research team collected only "crude information" about egg consumption from participants and this prevented them from estimating effects "more precisely" Yu said. "We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China."Part of a healthy dietCaroline Richard an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease. "Saying that this is a very large study and that in itself is a strength and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors" said Richard who was not involved in the research. Her own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors including higher rates of blood sugar inflammation and cholesterol.  "Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol" or "good" cholesterol she added. The new study then "delivers a similar message" that "egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease" Richard said. Some studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes she said. "In this study however they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it" Richard said. Still she noted "this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China."Cardiovascular disease which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Cardiovascular disease causes nearly a third -- 31% -- of all global deaths each year. "Overall I would say that consuming egg as part of a healthy diet does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and we now have another carefully done study to support that" Richard said.,Health
 (CNN)Maybe there's no need for a fountain of youth after all. New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.After just one year on a reduced-calorie diet study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress a process that has been tied to diabetes cancer Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.The study was published Thursday in the journal Cell Metabolism. "Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status" said Leanne M. Redman lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. Animal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?Aging biomarkersDuring the first phase teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction others tested exercise only and still others tested half-diet half-exercise.Another question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?Aging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy Redman said. "We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them" she said. After the pilot studies the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston. At Pennington Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study participants ate what they liked yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were "nutritionally adequate" Redman said.Each participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25% weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time. However the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated Redman said: "People achieved 15% calorie restriction actual over the two years." No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were "pretty remarkable" she said. For example participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.  "The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%" Redman said. This remained true after one year when weight loss peaked and after two years when weight remained constant. A slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy. "It's important because every time we generate energy in the body we generate byproducts" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism also called oxygen radicals accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs she explained. And this damage is "what has been linked to a shortened lifespan" she said.Not only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction then mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals Redman said.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Commit to your diet with this subscription meal kit'Breakthrough'The "big breakthrough" with this study said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.  Randomized controlled trials in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis. "It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents" Speakman said. Since then studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. "For example it doesn't work in houseflies" he said. "Plus the monkey literature is a bit confusing."For this reason the new study's "big contribution" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species Speakman said.That said the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was "rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals" he said. "This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans." However a strength of the new research is that it "included extensive measurements of the individual responses."Exactly how calorie restriction prevents aging Speakman said "is the million-dollar question." The research supports two theories of longer life: the "rate of living" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage. However the study shows a correlation only he said "so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research."Going forward Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.It's not only the diet she repeated. It's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet Redman said. "But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease.",Health
This is part two of a two-part feature. Part 1: Curbing salt intake could add years to your life (CNN)We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.When cutting back on sodium it's important to start slowly as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. "If you try to make chicken soup with no salt you will notice the difference" said Sonya Angelone a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use. You can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods or make your own versions like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example canned tomato sauce can have 1000 milligrams of sodium per serving. "But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth" to make a sauce Angelone said.Using herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili while blends containing rosemary thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes Angelone explained.When dining out ask for steamed vegetables and fish and skip the sauces. And when food shopping compare the sodium values of similar foods. "Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet according to the American Heart Association along with cold cuts and cured meats pizza soup sandwiches and poultry. Be sure to look for hidden sources of sodium. Code words for sodium on food labels include fleur de sel monosodium glutamate  and disodium guanylate. And don't be fooled by different forms of salt which may appear healthier than they are. "Himalyan pink salt or kosher salt or sea salt all have the same amount of sodium" Angelone said. And reduce the amount of processed food you eat. Salt vs. sodium and the problem with processed foodsSodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in foods and enters our diets through processed foods. White salt crystals are technically a combination of sodium and chloride. In fact by weight salt is about 40% sodium and 60% chloride.If you sprinkle a teaspoon of salt on your food regularly cutting it out will eliminate a day's worth of sodium. But that's just skimming sodium's surface because only 11% of the sodium in our diets comes from the salt shaker which we may grab during cooking or eating. About 15% of sodium in a typical American diet occurs naturally in foods. But the rest -- more than 70% -- comes from sodium in packaged prepared and restaurant foods including canned soups frozen foods and lunch meats. Some of top 25 foods that add the most sodium to your diet include pizza cold cuts burritos soup cheese milk eggs rice and cake.  Manufacturers add sodium to help preserve food and enhance the flavor and texture. But they are contributing to our increasingly high sodium intake. If less sodium is added to foods during processing it's much easier for consumers to cut back. To help Americans achieve recommended sodium levels the Food and Drug Administration recently proposed voluntary sodium reformulation targets for processed foods. Potassium-rich foods: An important part of a salt detoxIn addition to limiting sodium experts say that focusing on increasing potassium-rich foods is an important part of a salt detox. "Sodium stiffens your arteries ... but potassium does the opposite" Angelone said. To maximize your salt detox Angelone recommends limiting overly processed foods that contain a lot of sodium and replacing them with more potassium-rich produce as well as unsalted nuts beans and legumes."By eating less salty processed foods and more simple fresh foods you are going to automatically consume less sodium and more potassium" she said. Finally when you choose to consume salty snacks and foods be sure to savor them. "If you are going to have salt have it in something that really matters. ... It makes food taste good but make sure it really counts" Angelone said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.,Health
 (CNN)"Intermittent fasting" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce Hugh Jackman Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.The method is not appropriate for everyone however particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad. "The jury is still out especially on how healthy sustainable and realistic this approach is" said Samantha Heller a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. "Eating very low calories or none on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food."If you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.Pick the level of fasting you can handleThe appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity. One regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day whereas an approach known as the "5:2" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days during which anything can be eaten in any amount. Though time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day especially if you tend to skip breakfast alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain."People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult" said Kristen Smith a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.For the greatest success Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food such as a chef.Focus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting daysProtein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.If you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies grilled chicken over spaghetti squash an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt two cups of plain popcorn a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.High-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days. Don't gorge on non-fasting daysOur bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days when we do eat our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available Heller explained. "We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want" she said. That kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. "Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day" Smith said. In other words having pancakes with bacon for breakfast a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.Don't go overboard with exercise on fasting daysStrenuous exercise such as cycling running high-impact aerobics and weight lifting is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity Heller explained. If you want to do some form of physical activity on those days Smith recommends sticking with walking stretching or gentle yoga.Drink enough waterIf you decide to avoid food for any length of time adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. "On a fasting day someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals which is a common time people hydrate" Smith said. Foods such as fruits vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages as they may contribute to dehydration Smith said.Know when to stop If you experience lightheadedness dizziness fatigue nausea headachesdifficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning you should stop fasting."If any of these symptoms occur it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you" Smith said.Lisa Drayer is a nutritionist an author and a CNN health and nutrition contributor.,Health
Not long ago fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.Sugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose) sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup refined flours condiments soft drinks sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.The diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes heart disease and some cancers.And it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.But you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods eating more vegetables cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.At best the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.Diet mentalityThe sugar-free diet is restrictive with lists of "allowed" foods (such as whole grains blueberries and grapefruits) and "not allowed" foods (such as white bread bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.People who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.Research shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.Dieting is stressful. In response to this our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol which may cause the body to store fat particularly in the abdominal area.Worrying about food can lead to stress anxiety and depression and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia.Sugar in the diet may increase risks of opioid addictionOrthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to or a form of an eating disorder.Estimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.But we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice however well-intentioned doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.Cutting out the good stuffSome sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.These diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive "healthy" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper "unhealthy" fruits such as bananas.Whole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre essential vitamins and minerals as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.Many sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk yoghurt and cheese due to the assumption these contain sugars.The sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate) which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.Sugar replacementsStrangely many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content) maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.However these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue and dates which contain fibre.Is the food industry conspiring to make you fat?People often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.What to do insteadEat plenty of plants enjoy whole grains beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.Most people could probably eat a little less sugar a little less often but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.Savour every mouthful of that chocolate cake or "sometimes food". Turn off technology and eat the cake mindfully so that your brain can register that you have eaten it. That way you can get pleasure and satisfaction from it and you won't be craving it again an hour later.No matter how we choose to eat remember that health is not simply about the number on the scale the size of our waist or the foods we avoid. It's also about our psychological health and our relationship with food which is just as important as our physical health.Tara Leong is a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at the University of the Sunshine Coast.Copyright 2018 The Conversation.

 (CNN)Keeping your heart healthy is about more than avoiding fast food and overly processed chow. You can also pump up your heart's health by choosing foods that will help reduce cholesterol lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Which food groups have the most science behind their heart-healthy claims? Oats and barleyThe cell walls of oats and barley contain a special type of soluble fiber called beta-glucan which has a host of benefits for human health.  Studies show that it blunts the body's insulin response and boosts immunity and it may be protective during radiation and chemotherapy. But its role in cholesterol reduction is what counts for heart health."Beta-glucans bind to bile acids and cholesterol in the intestines and prevent their absorption into the body" CNN contributor and registered dietitian Lisa Drayer said. "So if you have high cholesterol it would be a good idea to incorporate oats or oatmeal for breakfast on a regular basis." Other grains such as rye wheat and sorghum contain beta-glucans but in much smaller quantities than oats and barley. Beta-glucans are also found in seaweed baker's yeast and various species of mushrooms such as reishi shiitake and maitake.Research shows that eating 3 grams of beta-glucans a day will reduce cholesterol by up to 10%. According to Heart UK a British charity dedicated to helping those with high cholesterol you can accomplish by eating a bowl of oatmeal each day; adding 2 tablespoons of oat bran to your smoothie soup or entree at lunch; and having an oatmeal cookie for a snack.Heart UK says you can replace one of those oat servings with 150 grams (⅔ cup) of cooked pearl barley.Salmon and other fatty fishFish oils especially omega-3 fatty acids are critical for maintaining a healthy heart. That means fatty fish such as salmon albacore tuna mackerel herring lake trout and sardines and crustaceans such as lobster oysters and squid are the protein staples of a heart-healthy diet. They all contain health-protective omega-3s specifically the long-chain variety known as LC omega-3 which contain eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Long-chain omega-3s have been shown in human clinical trials to prevent heart attacks by helping the heart maintain its rhythm. Studies show that they also make blood less likely to clot lower blood pressure keep blood vessels healthy and less likely to narrow reduce triglycerides and lower inflammation. Whew!The shorter chain of omega-3 called alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is found abundantly in oils plants nuts and seeds but evidence of its benefit is not as strong."The plant-based omega-3s in foods like flaxseed walnuts and canola oil don't contain DHA and EPA" Drayer said. "And while there are benefits to the plant ones as well you can't count on them as a source for their longer-chain cousins because they are not necessarily converted into them once they are in the body."Fatty fish like salmon have the most long-chain omega-3s and the American Heart Association recommends adding a 3½-ounce serving to your diet at least twice a week. Children and pregnant women should be careful to consume fish with lower levels of mercury the association says such as fresh and water-packed canned salmon.However Drayer says be careful how you prepare your catch."You can make healthy foods unhealthy depending on how you cook them" Drayer said. "For example if you deep-fry fish all the unhealthy saturated or trans fat can outweigh the heart-healthy benefits. Ideally you want to broil bake grill or poach -- but in water not in oil.  Oil will contribute lots of extra calories.  If a menu doesn't specify ask how the fish is poached."What if fatty fish is just not your thing?"If you never eat fish you might consider a fish-oil supplement because of all the research on omega-3's benefits for heart and brain health" Drayer said. "There are some foods fortified with EPA and DHA omega-3s" added registered dietitian Rahaf Al Bochi a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "Some of them are eggs milk juices peanut butter and margarine spreads.""So instead of having regular spread on your toast you can add something to your diet that has an added heart benefit" Drayer said. "Why not give yourself an added edge?"Be aware that most fortified foods have a fraction of the omega-3s of fatty fish and may be the shorter-chain variety.Dark leafy greens Salad greens spinach kale swiss chard collard and mustard greens are rich in vitamins A C E and K and contain antioxidants that help rid toxins from the body. But it's their abundance of calcium magnesium and potassium that puts them on the top 10 list for heart health."Potassium magnesium and calcium are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation" said Al Bochi who specializes in helping patients with Type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for heart disease."Potassium is known to help with limiting the effects of sodium on blood pressure" she explained "And it along with magnesium and calcium help the walls of the blood vessels relax which increases blood flow and reduces blood pressure."Greens have minimal calories: One cup of spinach or Swiss chard is only 7 calories and kale has 33. Nutritionists say it's usually best to get your calcium magnesium and potassium from foods instead of supplements so pile that plate high.  Plus greens -- like most vegetables -- are full of fiber which helps lower cholesterol levels prevents constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids) and by helping you feel full helps with weight control. And of course maintaining a healthy weight is a key to good heart health. Nuts and seedsUnsalted seeds and nuts are also high in potassium magnesium and other minerals known to reduce blood pressure. Studies on pistachios for example find that the nut can reduce blood vessel tightening (called peripheral vascular resistance) heart rate blood pressure and cholesterol. According to one study a single helping a day was better at lowering blood pressure than two helpings.Walnuts pecans almonds flaxseed macadamia nuts and hazelnuts are also good choices. Walnuts are especially high in omega-3s but are the short-chain variety. Still that's good for the heart."Though to a lesser extent than long-chain omega-3s" Drayer said "alpha linolenic acid (ALA) -- a short-chain omega-3 found in walnuts and flaxseed and canola oil -- has been associated with protection against high blood pressure and heart disease."  But keep in mind that all nuts are extremely high in calories. So an American Heart Association recommended serving is going to seem tiny: about 1½ ounces or 2 tablespoons of nut butter. Beware of the added salt sugar or chocolate that is so appealing on nuts -- not good for heart health.BeetsA surprising choice? Beets turn out to be chock full of nitric oxide which studies show can help open blood vessels and therefore lower your blood pressure. In fact a small study of Australian men and women found that drinking 500 grams (about 2½ cups) of beet juice significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) within six hours. That's not all. Beets and their juice are one of the only sources of betalain a powerful antioxidant with high anti-inflammatory qualities which has sparked research into how beets could be used to treat diseases caused by chronic inflammation such as arthritis cancer and heart failure. Avocados Already eating a healthy diet? Be sure to add avocadoes once a day. A study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that replacing saturated fat with one nutrient-packed avocado a day could lead to up to a 13.5 milligrams-per-deciliter reduction in blood pressure. That could be enough to keep some people off blood pressure meds researchers say.Avocados are a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids which can lower both your total cholesterol and your "bad" cholesterol (LDL) while maintaining your "good" cholesterol (HDL) levels. They can also benefit insulin control which can be very helpful to those with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes.Olive oilMonounsaturated fatty acids are a mainstay of the Mediterranean diet which has been shown to improve heart health and brain health lower risk for breast cancer and increase longevity.A key component of the Mediterranean diet is the use of olive oil for cooking and for dressing salads and vegetables in place of more saturated fats such as butter. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and both bad cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing good cholesterol.  HDL is often called the "friendly scavenger" because it scours the blood for bad cholesterol and gets rid of it before it clogs arteries. That's why having high levels of HDL is considered good for the heart.A recent study of 300 Spanish men and women at high risk for cardiovascular events sheds some light on how the higher HDL from olive oil might work. Researchers compared people who ate a Mediterranean diet based on nuts and a group based on olive oil. The group who ate more olive oil had better-functioning HDL; in other words their HDL was more efficient at finding and removing LDL and sending it to the liver as waste.  Regardless of how it works olive oil is extremely high in calories. It should be used in moderation and as a replacement for more unhealthy fats in the diet.LegumesNo heart-healthy list would be complete without legumes which include all kinds of beans lentils chickpeas and black-eyed peas. Legumes help the heart because of their high levels of soluble fiber which is known to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. "Soluble fiber binds to extra LDL cholesterol in the body and disposes it in the form of waste" Al Bochi said. "You can think of it as a type of sponge."Studies have shown that eating less than a cup of legumes improved blood pressure and a randomized controlled trial found that obese subjects who ate two servings a day of legumes and four servings of whole grains reduced their waist circumference weight triglycerides and blood pressure.Legumes contain no cholesterol and are only about 3% fat (unless they are prepared with lard or other unhealthy fats). They are full of iron manganese copper B vitamins magnesium zinc and phosphorous and they are very low on the glycemic index which means they have less effect on your blood sugar. They are also extremely high in protein; for example a half-cup of some legumes has 8 grams of protein.One caveat: Most people eat canned version of beans and other legumes which will be packed with salt as a preservative. Salt of course can raise blood pressure."Make sure that you rinse the excess salt and water before consuming" Al Bochi said.  "And it's not just beans and lentils. Whether it's canned corn canned peas carrots any type of canned food it's important to remove the salt."Low-fat dairyIt may seem odd to include dairy in a list of top heart-healthy foods but it turns out that milk cheese and yogurt can help reduce blood pressure. In a study by Boston University researchers followed the eating habits of 75000 people for up to 30 years and found that women who ate yogurt at least five times a week had a 20% reduction in their risk of developing high blood pressure. Milk and cheese also had an impact on lowering blood pressure but it was nothing like yogurt said the researchers. Men in the study consumed much less yogurt than the women; the effect on their blood pressure was weaker."Dairy products contain calcium potassium and magnesium which are important minerals to help with blood pressure control" Al Bochi said.  Those in the study who benefited most also closely followed the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute's DASH diet which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. Its premise is simple: Eat more veggies fruits and low-fat dairy foods while cutting way back on any food high in saturated fat and limit your intake of salt.The DASH meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day four to six servings of vegetables four to six servings of fruit two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes."You're getting the combination of benefits by consuming these foods because they do offer more than one heart-healthy nutrient" Drayer said.In the Boston study men and women who had a higher DASH score and who ate yogurt five or more times each week were 31% less likely to develop hypertension than participants who had low DASH scores and ate little yogurt.Though the study didn't track the type of yogurt eaten experts stress choosing low-fat versions."Dairy products can contain a high amount of saturated fat so be sure to choose low-fat products" Al Bochi said. "Saturated fat has been known to increase LDL cholesterol the bad cholesterol that can cause heart disease."A low-sodium balanced diet No. 10 on the heart healthy list may seem odd but it's important. Experts say that rather than focusing on just one or two of the heart healthy foods you would be better served to eat a well-rounded diet that focuses on healthy foods of all types and colors."If you feel like there is a 'superfood' that you want to incorporate on a daily basis say oats or salmon that's OK" Drayer said "but I really feel that eating a variety of healthy foods is best because you're getting a different nutrient package with each."The other thing I worry about is when people focus on one food they may think that is their key to good health and eat more unhealthy foods" Drayer added. "For example some people say 'I eat a lot of kale so I'm healthy' and they don't pay attention to the rest of their diet. No one food can undo damage from an unhealthy diet."Unless your doctor says otherwise part of a heart-healthy diet is watching your salt intake. The hidden salt in many of our processed foods make it extremely difficult: It's estimated that Americans get up to 80% of the salt in their diet from processed foods. The American Heart Association has a list of some of the top offenders called the "Salty Six": breads and rolls cold cuts and cured meats sandwiches pizza soup and chicken."Some ways to help reduce the amount of sodium in your diet is to limit the amount of processed foods the amount of frozen dinners for example as well as adding salt to foods yourself" Al Bochi said. "Consider using some herbs and spices as well as fresh lemon and vinegar to add some flavor to your meals."Finally a heart-healthy diet should just be part of an overall heart-healthy plan that includes exercise weight loss stress reduction and not smoking.Correction: A previous version of this story misstated where beta-glucans are absorbed in the body.,Health
"Fit Nation: Around the World in 8 Races" will air three times on Saturday September 15 between 1 and 6 p.m. ET and one time between 5 and 6 p.m. ET on Sunday September 16. (CNN)Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible Jesus rode one not a horse into Jerusalem. The significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant though that's not in the official canon. I checked.Domesticated for about 5000 years donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car our U-Haul vans engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.Burros as the Spanish call them walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.Like a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact they're the camels of the East North and South too as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America Europe Asia and Africa. As some industries faded the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race. "They teach us so much" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. "They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul."The first race was in 1949 which makes it according Wann the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon. The race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation. There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.But it's still a serious sport even if it has a sense of humor. "Haulin' Ass" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.A burro-ful dayOriginally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.Now both towns have their own races part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay is the longest (29 miles) tied for highest (more than 13000 feet) and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.Race day in July was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150000 people showed up to watch the start of the race. The smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.The start of the race is critical explained Wann. "Don't break their will let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down" he explained. "Burros will pair up and want to go that pace and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race not a human race."The course also ends in Fairplay running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode) and then heading up dirt roads trails and rocky terrain to the 13185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?) The age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70 and they came from all over the US Europe Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado the state where it was born. About a third of the runners were women this year. In fact the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller with her burro Pill in 1951 nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules even then). The donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course. And don't call donkeys mules which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.Rules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick gold pan shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.Like any ultramarathon especially with elevation endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result there are of course comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races teams have had to drop out when this happens. The air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions the views as wild and West as some of pack animals.This year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too collectively known as the Triple Crown. Breaking in"In the whole world there are probably fewer than 1000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012 pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)If you want to be among this elite crew your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances — putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.Then there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible. There are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. "If the burro doesn't trust you or like you or you are pushing too hard" said Wann "it's not going to work." Organizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann a self described "donkey matchmaker" and wife of Brad rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience."Burro racing is a very mental game" he added. "We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen."Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take literally. Sometimes you're pulling them other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. On flats either teammate can be in the lead or side-by-side but human runners are still doing the steering. You control a donkey through their nose pulling back on the rope to slow down like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a "hup-hup!" can get 'em goin' and the classic "whoa" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the "GPS for the critters" Wann said. Gear-wise runners need the right shoes clothes running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.Ass-essing risk and rewardAs with any ultramarathon trail run injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1212 active ultrarunners they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.Being tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners of course. If you trip you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest. The rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey but in the race's history injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back as they're out of the race anyway. Donkeys get injured too but in 70 years of racing not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery. Animal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. "Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified" the race rules state. "No needles electric prods narcotics clubs or whips other than the halter rope may be used." But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous. Organizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. "If you observe donkeys in the wild they aren't sedentary creatures" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. "In the wild donkeys are very trim athletic animals" and "they exercise all day long." "They are willing participants" Thompson writes alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. "If they don't want to go you can't make them do anything.",Health
 (CNN)You might think you're fairly intelligent but are you emotionally intelligent?It's our emotional intelligence that gives us the ability to read our instinctive feelings and those of others. It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.Most of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.But many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence according to Brackett a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.That's important because experts say the ability to read understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health happiness and personal and professional success.So maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.What is emotional intelligence?The theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey the 23rd president of Yale University and John "Jack" Mayer professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire wrote up the theory in 1990 Brackett said.Their work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior said Robin Stern associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator author and licensed psychoanalyst.Experts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. "Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions" she said.It's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others said Sara Canaday a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic can look at situations from an alternative point of view are considered open-minded bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face according to Canaday."Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world" Stern said. "People with more emotional intelligence are healthier happier and more effective" Brackett said.Why emotional intelligence mattersCanaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive résumé or a high IQ score.Wait really?Well ... just reflect on your own work experiences Canaday suggests. Has anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?  "We might be hired for technical talents but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence" Canaday said.Individuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful she said but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence. "It is how well you can collaborate how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart."Emotional intelligence testsBehavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments usually broken down into "your ability to manage yourself your ability to manage relationships your self-awareness and your social awareness" according to Canaday. Your results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence. But Brackett warns that "measurement is a tricky subject." In his early research he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them. Another form of an emotional intelligence test is a "360 assessment." In the workplace setting a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often "see ourselves differently than others do."When a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser perhaps a current or former boss to evaluate your emotional intelligence she said. But Canaday cautions If you ask for someone's feedback be prepared to accept what they share. "This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand we say we want to learn and grow but on the other hand we want to be accepted just the way we are and those two human traits run counter."Can I improve my emotional intelligence?So maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that? From the earliest ages children should be taught how to recognize their emotions understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves Stern said. For adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. "Pick one or two areas where you want to grow and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop." If you are trying to gain better control of your anger for example you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing. Canaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. "Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do then you are hearing the same conversations and you are not growing and you are not learning to be open to perspectives."Brackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to "spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions be more self- and socially aware about your presence." Stern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions. How we talk to ourselves can also have a huge impact on our emotions and our health if that self-talk is not positive Stern says. She suggests that we would never talk to another individual the way we often talk to ourselves. "There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are allowed themselves to have emotions made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world we would in fact have a better world." ,Health
 (CNN)Your stamina -- or the time it takes for you to reach peak exhaustion during exercise -- can be tied to your dementia risk and a new study reveals how.The study published Wednesday in the medical journal Neurology found that women with high cardiovascular fitness or high stamina had an 88% lower risk of dementia than women who were moderately fit."I was not surprised that there was an association but I was surprised that it was such a strong association between the group with highest fitness and decreased dementia risk" said Helena Hörder a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who was first author on the study.Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain often leading to memory loss or other problems with brain function. Alzheimer's disease an irreversible and progressive brain disease is the most common type of dementia.About 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.About 850000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole according to the UK's National Health Service.Worldwide about 50 million people have dementia and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year according to the World Health Organization.The new study involved 191 women in Sweden 38 to 60 years old who completed an ergometer cycling test to evaluate their cardiovascular fitness.During the test the women's workload was measured based on how much weight or resistance could be added to the bicycle before they became fatigued."The level that you are so exhausted that you have to interrupt the test is a measure in watts of your work capacity" Hörder said. "Cardiovascular fitness or endurance can also be tested in a submaximal test where you don't push the person to maximal capacity."Some of the women had to interrupt their cycling test at submaximal workload before being pushed to maximal capacity mainly due to changes seen on an electrocardiograph or due to high blood pressure.Based on their crude peak workload the women were separated into three groups: Fifty-nine were in the "low fitness" group 92 were "medium fitness" and 40 were "high fitness."Those cycling tests were conducted in 1968 and the women were followed over a 44-year period until 2012. During that time the researchers tracked the women's health taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.The researchers found that among all of the women 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload that percentage jumped to 45%."Many of those who interrupted the test at submax very low watt level probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status" Hörder said. "This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis."The researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the "high fitness" group than in the "medium fitness" group and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: "High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%" the researchers wrote.The study had some limitations including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger more diverse group.Also the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.For instance other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk as well as the social aspects of fitness as loneliness has been linked to dementia."One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations and they can't necessarily talk about causality" said Keith Fargo director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago who was not involved in the new study.Still he said "the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife not just old age when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias."The new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors such as poor cardiovascular health a sedentary lifestyle poor diet smoking or excessive alcohol consumption.So people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise stopping smoking eating a healthy diet getting enough sleep staying socially engaged challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health according to the Alzheimer's Association."There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain" Fargo said. "The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ meaning that your brain has many blood vessels" he said. "The demand for nutrient- oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health.",Health
 (CNN)High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018. Such training known as HIIT typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds for example during a moderate-pace jog.The US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children noted Walter R. Thompson author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. "So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from say walking to jogging it decreases to 75 minutes per week."HIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines he said. "But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything there may be an increased risk of injury." If you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts Thompson recommends that you "get a good physical exam" before starting a program.Over the past 12 years the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals including personal trainers and physical therapists to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year. This year's survey which included responses from 4133 fitness professionals around the globe placed "group training" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile "wearable technology" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third and "body weight training" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. "Strength training" or the use of barbells and weights placed fifth.  Thompson said the survey was developed for two purposes the first being "to help guide the fitness industry." Although most of the industry is "commercial properties" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers."They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something they know it's going to work" Thompson said. "We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym the clients" he said. "It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs."Three new trends found a place on the top 20 list: "licensure for fitness professionals" "core training" and "sport-specific Training." Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport such as tennis or boxing.Meanwhile "work-site health promotion" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and "outcomes measures" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.One of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the "re-emergence of group exercise programs" said Thompson who remembers "back in the day when that was all we did." Personal training which was introduced around 2000 reduced the popularity of group training he noted.  However after the recession less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. "It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses" Thompson said.Another trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs. Most gyms "still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket" Thompson said. But the "really smart clubs" are changing music and lighting during slower times when the typical gym-goer is at work "so that now the 60-year-old feels comfortable going into the gym" he said. "It makes total sense." Finally yoga remains in the top 10 where it has been since the survey started Thompson said. "Yoga keeps reinventing itself.",Health
 (CNN)If you ask almost any fitness professional how to lose your love handles they will tell you two things: No amount of abdominal crunches will make a difference if you don't first improve your diet and exercise regimen. And there is no such thing as "spot reducing" when it comes to fat loss so you can't target this area alone. Love handles the pinchable fat on both sides of your stomach that leads to a "muffin top" appearance are especially stubborn. They do not respond as quickly to diet and exercise changes as the more dangerous visceral fat that is deep within your abdomen and leads to more of a "potbelly" appearance. If you are a woman and your waist is larger than 35 inches around or a man with a waist size greater than 40 inches you will lose the deep belly fat first. This is actually better for your health as visceral fat has been linked to numerous medical issues including high blood pressure high cholesterol pre-diabetes and inflammation. To lose the subcutaneous fat that forms not-so-lovable love handles (or excess fat on your hips thighs and buttocks) it's going to take even more time and effort. What is the best diet for losing your love handles? The one you can stick with long-term as it's not going to be quick or easy for most people. This is especially true for men as this is often the last place on their body where they lose weight. In terms of specific exercise recommendations three top trainers shared the advice they give their A-list clients. Gunnar Peterson who trains Hollywood actors and professional athletes including the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers advocates a comprehensive lifestyle approach that includes clean eating adequate sleep stress management plenty of hydration and sprint work mixed with steady-state cardio on alternate days to optimize fat burning. Sprint work also known as high-intensity interval training involves alternating periods of maximum effort with periods of recovery (not be confused with rest). The duration of sprints can increase and recovery periods can decrease as your fitness levels improve. Steady-state cardio involves working out at approximately 65% to 85% of your maximum heart rate for at least 30 minutes. One exercise Peterson does not recommend for reducing love handles is side bends with heavy weights. This type of exercise can actually exacerbate the appearance of love handles by increasing the size of the underlying external oblique muscles. Instead he recommends working all of the abdominal muscles not just the obliques in multiple planes of motion. Exercises that reach those areas include wood chops medicine ball rotations medicine ball slams (at a variety of angles) and banded overhead extensions side to side and back to front.Ami Jampolis a top San Francisco Bay Area trainer (and full disclosure my sister) recommends high-intensity circuit training several times a week to build or maintain calorie-burning muscle along with several days of steady-state cardiovascular training. High-intensity circuit training involves alternating strength training exercises (such as a pushup) and short bouts of cardiovascular exercises (such as jumping jacks) with minimal rest in between. This type of training is gaining popularity for its fast pace and time efficiency and can be done at home or at a gym that specializes in this type of training. For homing in on the oblique muscles Jampolis agrees with Peterson about avoiding side bends with weights. Instead she suggests two very simple yet effective exercises that don't seem to have the bulking effect on the oblique abdominal muscles: side planks and bicycles. Both can be done anywhere and don't require any equipment.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Integrate at-home interval training into your workout routine with these beginner-friendly productsCelebrity trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak takes an even simpler approach to losing your love handles. In addition to cleaning up their diets he gives all his clients fitness trackers to ensure that they meet his required 12000 steps per day and seven hours of sleep per night. He finds that higher-intensity training can often increase appetite making it harder to stick to a diet so he prefers simply walking along with regular strength training that includes working each major body part at least once per week. Although their approaches may vary professionals agree with the popular saying "abs are made in the kitchen not the gym." If you really want to lose your love handles start by finding a diet plan that works for you and that you can stick with long-term and then build in an exercise program that works with your current fitness level exercise preference budget and schedule. How to do a side plank: Lying on your side lift your body onto your forearm keeping hips feet and shoulders stacked over one another. Aim to hold this position for as long as possible increasing the time as you get stronger. Make sure not to collapse into your upper back. If your balance is a little off you can place one foot in front of the other for more stability. Switch sides and repeat three times. As you advance you can drop your hips to the floor and then bring them back up to the side plank position 15 to 20 times and repeat three sets per side.How to do bicycles: Lie on your back with both knees bent at a 90-degree angle and place your hands behind your head. Fully extend one leg out about 6 inches above the ground bringing your opposite elbow to the opposite knee. With control bring the extended leg in and extend the other leg out simultaneously bringing the other elbow to the opposite knee. Make sure to twist from your stomach and not your neck. Control is key on this exercise; speed is not your friend. Aim for switching every two seconds. Aim for three sets of 60 (30 per leg).

The world is obsessed with fad diets and weight loss yet few of us know how a kilogram of fat actually vanishes off the scales.Even the 150 doctors dietitians and personal trainers we surveyed shared this surprising gap in their health literacy. The most common misconception by far was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter which all chemical reactions obey.Some respondents thought fat turns into muscle which is impossible and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.So if not energy muscles or the loo where does fat go?The enlightening facts about fat metabolismThe correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.If you lose 10 pounds of fat precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.This surprises just about everyone but actually almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.Protein shares the same fate except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids which you excrete as urine.Why is obesity getting worse in America?The only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and after that it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.Kilograms in versus kilograms outWe all learn that "energy in equals energy out" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity.The reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms too not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.According to the latest government figures Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water.What's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen too and this figure is equally important for your waistline.If you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces) then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight more than 4.1kg will have to go.Want to fix America's health? First focus on foodThe 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates fats protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.An average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure despite the bold claims you might have heard.The good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.Eat less exhale moreSo if fat turns into carbon dioxide could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.But here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours you'd exhale more than 1200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.More realistically going for a walk triples your metabolic rate and so will cooking vacuuming and sweeping.Metabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.Therefore to lose 100 ounces of fat you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food no matter what you eat.Any diet that supplies less "fuel" than you burn will do the trick but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works few of us know why.Ruben Meerman is an assistant scientist at the University of New South Wales and author of "Big Fat Myths: When You Lose Weight Where Does the Fat Go?"

 (CNN)We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. "I love you" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world spoken millions of times every day. "I love you" translates intimacy between ourselves and others but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system where we process love. Psychologist Abraham Maslow created a "hierarchy of needs" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve with love cited as a basic need after safety food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth a deep sense of belonging an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people. Still how do we arrive at a loving state?Researchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing "I love you." Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. "It is possible for people to feel loved in simple everyday scenarios" explained the study's lead researcher Zita Oravecz. "It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures." Here are easy and effective ways to communicate "I love you." Read: Valentine's Day: Managing the pressureGive a small personalized gift Gifts are common enough that they can become as generic an exchange as "I love you" -- but not if you consider the receiver and tailor it to them. A sense of humor helps too. Author Sue Shapiro suggests "Instead of flowers or candy (which don't do anything for me) my husband will bring me a ream of paper and a little bottle of Wite-Out when he knows I have a deadline. True love! And I feel like someone actually knows me." Make foodMake someone's favorite dessert "just because" or give a freezable dinner to a busy friend. One study found evidence that offering food is seen as a form of affection and sharing food an indicator of love. Take that a step further and you could say cooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing altruistic act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness according to one study. Making food as way to express love explained dating expert and author James Michael Sama "brings people together in gatherings and celebrations and can be used as a bonding experience with cooking and sharing." This combination of doing an altruistic creative act while fulfilling someone's need to eat is mutually good for well being and feeling loved. CuddleCozy up. Researchers recruited nearly 500 Americans to answer a questionnaire featuring 60 common interactions and explain whether those activities give them feelings of love. "A child snuggling up to you" received 97% consensus on a hypothetical action that would make them feel loved. Besides boosting loving feelings cuddling lowers stress and boosts immunity according to one study. Call or write a note out of the blueWe often reach out to wish someone a happy birthday arrange plans or ask for help. Try contacting someone to ask how they are or simply to chat. Doing so has the potential to produce tenderness. More than 90% of that questionnaire's participants agreed that "someone calling to check in out of the blue" made them feel loved.Take a task off their 'to do' listPut away the dishes from the dishwasher. Fold the laundry without being asked. Pick up milk from the store. Relieving someone's burden even a minor one demonstrates care. "Try to pinpoint the small things someone does for you that warms your heart" said Saeideh Heshmati a co-author of the Penn State study and a postdoctoral research scholar there. "Once you find those little things try to savor them and preserve that feeling. As you're aware you're more prone to perceive them as love." ,Health
 (CNN)Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia a new study suggests.The paper published Monday in the journal Nature Reviews Cancer finds that acute lymphoblastic leukemia the most common type of childhood cancer is caused by a two-step process. The first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.More specifically children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia the paper says.The author Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves suggests the cancer could be preventable.Greaves reviewed more than 30 years of research including his own on the genetics cell biology immunology epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered "why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.""This body of research is a culmination of decades of work and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops" he said in a statement. "The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed."However other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia known as ALL is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly over days or weeks building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.Rates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018 with 1470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK according to Cancer Research UK.While a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced affluent societies which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life. Previous claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.The body of research "busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution" said Greaves.Greaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year its immune system is strengthened. But later infections without the initial priming can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.Population studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL probably by priming the immune system according to the study.Greaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia probably have different causal mechanisms."Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe" said Paul Workman chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research London.However other experts are more cautiously hopeful emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL."If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality" said Alasdair Rankin director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise."There is no proven link yet with a specific infection" said Dr. Donna Lancaster consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. "This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.Sheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain."It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system" said Cruickshank in a statement. "Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review."The research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However Charles Swanton chief clinician of Cancer Research UK stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed."This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs dirt and illness" Swanton said. "We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.",Health
 (CNN)If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other it is confidence.I've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure. Growing up as a perfectionist somewhat fearful of both failure and success I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.For all these reasons I was thrilled when one of my daughters during the first grade had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now "What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?"Journalist author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014 she and her co-author Katty Kay anchor of BBC World News America published "The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know." The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.As Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book one of the most common questions they would get was from parents women and men who were concerned about their daughters." 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter' " Shipman said they would say. "It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' "  Shipman who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school although it is applicable for girls up through high school Shipman says.In "The Confidence Code for Girls: Taking Risks Messing Up Your Amazingly Imperfect Totally Powerful Self" Shipman and Kay use graphic novel illustrations quizzes checklists and real stories from girls to try to make the topic accessible and relatable.They also commissioned an online poll which backs up what other research has shown.Between the ages of 8 and 14 girls' confidence drops by 30% according to the survey of nearly 1400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians. The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing"We were surprised at how quickly how deep that drop is" Shipman said. "And especially because right until age 8 there's really no difference in confidence levels."So how do we stop this troubling trend? I asked Shipman a mom of two  for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter with good results.1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.One of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters Shipman said is to help them get "comfortable being uncomfortable." Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks they will have succeeded.As for how to do that a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. "It's kind of counterintuitive but just telling yourself 'Oh you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary" Shipman said.So encourage your daughter and tell her "Yes it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway' " Shipman said.2. Have her keep a list of risks.Having your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.Also have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation such as "I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it."3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'Our girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. "We all need a cheat sheet to failure" Shipman and Kay write.They offer a list of 10 "failure fixes" such as "change the channel." Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place whether that is reading a book watching TV listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.Another fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor which she called a "virtual hot air balloon ride." Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. "First that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective like 'Wow look other things are going on' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way."Trying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. "Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!" they write.4. Role model failure and struggle. One of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.How could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual."Perfectionism or worry about this or that or sort of reticence to raise your hand that's recognizable to us" Shipman said. "Even if instinctively we know it's wrong it doesn't seem odd because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it whereas I think fathers who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange."The takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us especially mothers dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks."If we're going on 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right' it doesn't help them" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and "lift the veil a little bit."When she's upset about something for instance such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.With all the talk about girls and confidence it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence."It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys" Shipman said. "I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on essentially the world doesn't operate like school."Helping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers Shipman said."Girls even when they speak up in class or whatever it is they want to please people so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them" Shipman said. "And when they speak up some people will like what they say and others won't and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK because I'm me.' " ,Health
 (CNN)A few years ago when my girls were in the second and third grades they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.Their teachers would put on a video which encouraged the kids to get up and dance and then they'd get back to work. "What a brilliant idea" I remember thinking at the time.My kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.Groups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.It all seems like a no-brainer especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse. As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated let's get our kids to move.The challenge though is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training. Research: Physical activity benefits studentsJust as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy they can teach physical literacy teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life said Susan Kamin chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.The for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides "BrainErgizer" videos five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain. Dr. John Ratey an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain."When you move you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with and when you stimulate those nerve cells it gets them ready to do stuff" said Ratey an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of "Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the "attention systems" of the brain."When you exercise you turn on the attention systems so that means you're (paying) better attention you're able to deal with more frustration you're able to stay with it longer" he said. "You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it."A recent study a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math. The study published in the journal Pediatrics involved more than 10000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity especially physical education improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement especially math-related skills and reading."The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results academically" Kamin said. "It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom because if kids are able to move they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out."Breakthrough Magnet School South a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford Connecticut is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before but since the partnership the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience Principal Julie Goldstein said."I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured" Goldstein said.Her third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district she said. Beyond the benefits academically there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy she might have had one or two office referrals every month she said."This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings disagreements and even injuries at recess time and we've had none so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom" she said. "Even during the unstructured times they're better able to manage themselves to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to which is to give them time to play and have fun."Using screens to get kids moving Four out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom the company says.The concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos often about two minutes in length that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.KC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+ which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos games and classroom resources.)Estenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who like most parents has struggled with how much time his kids ages 8 12 and 14 spend on screens during the day."GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active" Estenson said. "The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen which is active engagement versus passive engagement and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive binge viewing hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else."The key he said is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12 grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness."And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there" said Estenson.'It really validates ... what teachers know'Active Schools which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative is a national movement partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.The goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play."One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' " said Charlene Burgeson executive director of Active Schools.Streamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money time and philosophy.Schools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum."I know lots of teachers who say 'Yeah I wish I had more time to do this' " the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be she said."It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke why fix it?'  Yet the schools that have made the leap see tremendous results. So how do you move the needle?",Health
 (CNN)We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.From the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.Of course you can't. Even that "Prince Charming" narrative in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return is everywhere.But what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.Even before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women even in children's programming.Research shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.Let me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10. Helping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits which brings me to "Andi Mack" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.Think about the storyline which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character Andi learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys and Cyrus who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.My girls ages 10 and 11 and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.'A girl can do anything a boy can do'TerrI Minksy the creator and executive producer of "Andi Mack" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof."There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made" said Minsky who made the pilot with a predominantly female team."I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power."Sofia Wylie plays Buffy who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia 14 believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch."I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference" said Sofia also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on "America's Got Talent.""So many people say 'Oh yeah boys are just like stronger' and when a boy says that I'm going to contain myself now" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. "It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man."Even today in 2018 a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well."People think if you're competitive that means you're mean" she said. "No she's competitive for a separate reason because she's been told that she has to be strong." In one episode we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom who is in the military is away during months-long deployments.A story line with #MeToo resonanceOne of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.And then Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom Bex she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when I would argue many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves "Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?" Lilan Bowden who plays Bex Andi's independent and individualistic mother says she wishes she had "Andi Mack" when she was a girl. Instead the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy the boy finally says he likes her back and they get together."That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice eventually you'll get what you want" Bowden said. "And to have that character to say 'I was nice and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge."Minsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement. When Andi expresses herself to Jonah she's the one who is in charge for the first time said Minsky who also created "Lizzie McGuire" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit. "It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances and the boy's sitting back and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself and he's like 'Oh wow I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me' and I kind of feel 'yeah I bet you did.' " (In another sign of the show's relatable nature it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)Peyton Elizabeth Lee who plays Andi said she Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was "finally finding her voice.""Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute and he's fun and he has so many friends and he's popular and he's athletic and whatever' but when it really comes down to it he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him" said Peyton 13 who has appeared on ABC's "Scandal" and "Shameless" on Showtime."I think she was realizing that she's worth more so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete."Gender equality in media? Long way to go There is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film. Research commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25% when women make up just about half of the actual work force. Fictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.We know that when you see it you can be it. In a survey of 1000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.Sixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics. Bowden who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy hopes shows like "Andi Mack" are a marker for what is to come. When she got to Hollywood and was auditioning there was a very limited selection of roles for women she said. "It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy" she said. "I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model."This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning" she said. With surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive."I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself" Sofia told my daughters. "I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is we're all ourselves."Added Peyton "A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer it all works out. If you're nice you get friends. You have a boyfriend but it's just not like that and you have to find that balance of being nice but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go.",Health
 (CNN)Several former NFL players called Thursday for an end to tackle football for kids ages 13 and under.Pro football Hall of Famers Nick Buoniconti and Harry Carson joined four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Phil Villapiano and researchers from Boston University to make the announcement. They're working with the Concussion Legacy Foundation to support a new parent education initiative Flag Football Under 14 that pushes for no tackle football until the age of 14. "I beg of you all parents to please don't let your children play football until high school" said Buoniconti 77 who has been diagnosed with dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy a neurodegenerative disease."I made the mistake starting tackle football at 9 years old. Now CTE has taken my life away. Youth tackle football is all risk with no reward."Buoniconti helped the Miami Dolphins to three straight Super Bowl appearances including two wins and an undefeated season in 1972 the only such season in all of NFL history. In November he said he intended to donate his brain to research. New York Giants legend Carson echoed Buoniconti's sentiments."I did not play tackle football until high school I will not allow my grandson to play until 14 as I believe it is not an appropriate sport for young children" Carson said. Villapiano is best known for his big plays for the Oakland Raiders. He said that witnessing how CTE ravaged his teammate and friend Ken Stabler is causing him to speak out about the dangers of tackle football for children under 14."At some point those of us who have had success in this game must speak up to protect both football players and the future of the game and supporting 'Flag Football Under 14' is our best way to do that" he said.How CTE beginsThe players along with researchers Chris Nowinski of the Concussion Legacy Foundation and Dr. Robert Cantu and Dr. Lee Goldstein of Boston University pointed to studies that showed CTE can start early in life and without any signs of concussion. A study co-authored by Goldstein and published Thursday in the journal Brain came to that conclusion. It found some changes in the brain occurred as early as 24 hours after injury.Goldstein and his colleagues advocate for no tackle football before 14 because children's bodies particularly their necks and upper bodies aren't strong enough to counteract the bobbling of the head and shaking of the brain that occurs during tackles. Dr. Julian Bailes the director of neurosurgery and co-director of NorthShore University HealthSystem Neurological Institute and medical director for Pop Warner said the concern over repeated hits is magnified in high school after kids are 14."The real exposure to larger players higher velocity hits and hundreds of hits starts in high school" he said. Goldstein said parents should heed the warning that CTE can develop early -- and the focus on concussions doesn't reduce the risk. "The NFL is setting a bad example by focusing on the concussion and while not focusing on the hits" said Goldstein. The NFL and Dr. Allen Sills it's chief medical officer did not respond when asked whether the league is considering changing its CTE and concussion protocol because of the recent study. "As highlighted in this recent study repetitive hits to the head have been consistently implicated as a cause of CTE by this research group. How and why exactly this manifests who is at risk and why -- these are questions that we as researchers and clinicians are working to answer" Sills said.  Sills noted changes the NFL has made to reduce head-to-head contact over the years including limiting how much players can wear their helmets off-season and limiting full-padded practices during the season. The NFL has also made grants and supported brain science.Goldstein said concussions remain the red herring of CTE. "We will never prevent CTE by focusing on concussions. Any meaningful prevention campaign has to focus on preventing all hits to the head including sub-concussive impacts" said Goldstein.And one way to do that he said is to limit overall exposure to hits by waiting to play tackle football. Carson the former linebacker noted that "the game is more popular now.""Parents should understand exactly what they are signing their kids up for" he said.CNN's Kwegyirba Croffie contributed to this report.,Health
 (CNN)Sexting among teens and younger children has increased over the past decade and poses a growing challenge for educators and parents according to a new study. One in four young people said they'd received sexts and one in seven reported sending them according to the study which was published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016 with a total of 110380 participants all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11. The researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people. The increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.With that trend in mind the study's authors suggest that "age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education." Why sext?The researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people."As teens get older we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior" said study co-author Jeff Temple a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch. "It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are."Kami Kosenko a communications professor at North Carolina State University agreed: "As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication of which sexting is a part." Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.Teens sometimes 'assume safety' The study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved especially among younger children that is a cause for concern the researchers said.Preteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail."As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting" Temple said. On average children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones. Danger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private although this may not be the case. "Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not" said study co-author Sheri Madigan an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary. "Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect" Madigan said. "When they send a picture they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture." Kosenko said that "with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety."Part of the problem lies in the children's brains Madigan said. "Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting."There is little or no literature on tweens  and sexting according to Madigan who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic. Nonconsensual sextingAccording to the study 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver."That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting they can talk about those potential risks" Madigan said.Nonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health."If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced that is where you see the negative mental health problems and we see the same thing with sexting" Temple said. According to the study further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting "to appropriately target and inform intervention education and policy efforts."What parents need to knowJAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as "the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages." This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to "prove" how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.The biggest concern according to the journal is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:Start the discussion early with your kids using broad questions such as "have you heard of sexting?"  By understanding what your child already knows you can then frame your conversation. Use examples appropriate for your child's age. Be specific about the possible consequences of sexting. "Parents should be proactive and not reactive" Madigan said. Remind your teenager of their own worth. Let them know that being pressured is not OK and that sexting is not a way to "prove" their love. "If you have the conversation early and often when problems arise then kids know they can go to their parents and talk to them" Madigan said.Being open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting Kosenko said."This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion" she said."You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting.",Health
 (CNN)As a mom of two daughters I'm mindful of how girls today have more opportunity than ever. In fact I tell my girls this all the time: They can be anything they want and shatter any glass ceiling even the highest one the presidency. Be confident and speak up and you can achieve great things we tell our girls. You can play any sport join any after-school club volunteer for any cause and get the grades. In fact girls are regularly outperforming boys in school and enrolling in higher numbers in college.It's a great time to be a girl -- or is it? Because behind all these possibilities is a troubling development: Girls' anxiety and depression are climbing and increasingly turning tragic.Between 2007 and 2015 the suicide rate for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 doubled reaching a 40-year high in 2015 according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics."I think no one can dispute the wholesale kind of collapse of girls' wellness right now" said bestselling author Rachel Simmons who has been working with and doing research on girls for the past two decades."It's really a crisis. I don't think I'm overstating it. Everywhere I go I hear about levels of anxiety that are so crippling that it makes it hard for teachers to teach and we can't not pay attention to this anymore."Simmons points to the findings of a 2015 freshman survey by UCLA of 150000 full-time students at more than 200 colleges and universities.Twice as many girls as boys reported that they felt depressed frequently or occasionally and twice as many girls as boys said they were "overwhelmed with all they had to do" -- a 25% jump in the number of girls in both categories in just over 15 years according to Simmons.What's behind these concerning numbers? As Simmons writes in her new book "Enough As She Is: How to Help Girls Move Beyond Impossible Standards of Success to Live Healthy Happy and Fulfilling Lives" girls are growing up with outsize expectations of personal and professional success. The pressure to be great at everything is causing them to feel less confident more fearful of failure and more critical of themselves Simmons says.Girls' psychology and culture on 'collision course'"There is a deep mismatch in terms of what the culture is telling girls and their most vulnerable parts of their psychology" said Simmons who is also co-founder of the national nonprofit Girls Leadership.Girls are socialized at a very young age to rely heavily on feedback from others. They grow up paying more and more attention to what other people think of them and whether they are measuring up to those external expectations.In today's society that relentless concern about pleasing others is on what Simmons calls a collision course with two cultural changes: the ubiquitousness of social media which is exacerbating the need to perform and heightened expectations of what it means to be a successful girl today."We're now giving girls access to STEM (science technology engineering and math). We're giving girls access to opportunities they've never had before. And we're not doing that and saying 'Oh you don't have to have a bikini body anymore. That's cool. You're good. You can look however you want to look' " Simmons said. "No we're saying 'keep your bikini body and become an engineering major and also have a totally lit Snapchat feed on a Saturday night' and so that's exhausting and I call that role overload and role conflict."Social media alone becomes a "virtual second shift" for young girls almost like a full-time job as they spend more time on average on Instagram and Snapchat that boys do."Social media enables them to curate an exhausting range of identities -- jock scholar beauty queen party girl best friend and on and on -- demanded by the new rules of girl success crammed into a twenty-four-hour day" she writes in "Enough As She Is."Simmons said she wishes she didn't have to write this book. In her bestseller "The Curse of the Good Girl" published in 2009 she wrote about the need to teach girls how to take up space find courage and be confident. But in her work with girls on college campuses and elementary middle and high schools across the country she started to see that the wellness piece was missing."Despite very high levels of achievement girls were struggling with a sense of imposter syndrome low lack of confidence overthinking and an enduring belief that no matter how hard they tried they were not enough of whatever it was" said Simmons who has a young daughter of her own. "Moreover the terms of success that they had established for themselves were so kind of outsized and unrealistic and unhealthy that they were on this hamster wheel of trying to get something they were never going to get."Simmons said she has come to realize that in order to help girls become stronger and more confident we have to attend to their emotional health. "We never thought about girls' leadership as being integrated into their wellness and ... that's the shift that's taking place is that we need to start thinking about wellness in tandem with growing their confidence and growing their achievement."Changing how we teach girls Tara Christie Kinsey head of school at The Hewitt School a girls' private school in New York City and a former dean at Princeton University said that what she and her colleagues in higher education have seen across college campuses for years are young girls with "amazing ... paper resumes" with all the right grades and SAT scores. It "looks amazing on paper and yet the interior life of young women in particular was sorely lacking" said Kinsey who has a daughter in the third grade and a son in the fifth grade. She tells the story of meeting with a female college student when her then-5-year-old daughter burst through the office door so excited to show her mom the contents of her kindergarten folder. When her daughter left "the young woman looked at me and she said 'I remember when I used to have that kind of confidence.' " As an educator and an advocate for girls and women Kinsey said she is focused on the gap between what we know girls need to thrive and be healthy and how we're teaching them every day whether it's in the classroom or in the home."I think that better understanding that gap holds many of the keys to closing yet another gap the success gap between how girls are faring in school -- where we know they're crushing it and they're outperforming boys and they're achieving at levels we've never seen before -- and how they're faring in life after school" Kinsey said. "They're coming up against not only a structural glass ceiling but also a psychological glass ceiling that thwarts their self-actualization."Kinsey was familiar with Simmons' books and incorporated her research into her work in higher education. When she moved to The Hewitt School she wanted to bring Simmons' teachings and experience to students faculty and parents in the community. In 2016 Simmons was named the inaugural Girls' Research Scholar in Residence at Hewitt.Simmons' work at Hewitt involves helping the girls and young women build their skills in the broad category of emotional intelligence Kinsey said with a focus on healthy risk-taking conflict resolution self-advocacy managing friendships and the giving and receiving of feedback.She may be sprawled on the floor with an entire grade of middle-schoolers tracing their bodies for an exercise on the difference between feelings you sometimes keep inside such as jealousy and feelings you express such as anger. She might be sitting crisscross apple sauce with elementary school girls talking about the difference between a real apology and a not-so-real apology.Or she may be standing on a chair and reciting a poem demonstrating how the pressure to be perfect really undermines the ability to give and receive authentic feedback."What I'm trying to do is fill in the blanks in terms of some of the skills that they don't have" Simmons said. "So sure they're really good at doing their worksheets and the homework and sitting quietly in class discussions and taking exams but when something goes off the rails then we're working with them on how do you cope? We're filling in the blanks and I contend that if you fill in the blanks ... then we're going to see a better balance between all of this ... on-paper success and what's happening inside."But right now things are out of whack. We got overdeveloped on paper and very underdeveloped in life and in terms of resilience (and) adaptability."It is that fear of failure that can really be crippling for girls and young women today which is why Simmons who is also a leadership development specialist at Smith College regularly concludes her orientation programs on college campuses with a graduation ceremony. The young women who attend will each receive a "Certificate of Failure."The mock diploma reads "Having honorably fulfilled all the requirements imposed by the overload of high school you are hereby certified to screw up bomb or otherwise fail" during college "and still be a totally worthy utterly excellent human" Simmons writes in her book.The girls laugh she writes but then they take those certificates back to their dorm rooms. "Every girls needs a Certificate of Failure" she writes.Helping parents combat 'not-enoughness'At Hewitt Simmons also works with the teachers helping them see the importance of trying to teach soft skills such as resilience and adaptability just like they are teaching anything else.Instead of giving feedback on written work a teacher might do a one-on-one consultation with the student in which they focus on her goals and what she hopes to achieve in her next writing sample. In math teachers don't typically give girls grades on quizzes; they give written feedback so the girls can learn from their mistakes. "You see how that's just completely transformative to girls and relationships to their own achievement" Kinsey said. "It's not about grades. It's about growth. It's about feedback. It's about failure. It's about honoring mistakes as a necessary part of the learning process."As part of her work at Hewitt Simmons also meets regularly with parents and tries to help them "combat the sense of shame and 'not-enoughness' that so many parents have.""This is an era in which parents are probably the least confident they're ever been in themselves" Simmons said. "If we want our kids to feel like they are enough the parents have to feel like they are enough."During coffee talks she tries to help parents feel comfortable enough to share what they are most afraid of such as concerns that their daughter doesn't have a ton of friends or isn't getting the best grades."We had a couple of faculty members who aren't parents who were sitting there going 'Oh my God. I had no idea that parents were that scared about their kids and all I see is 'my daughter didn't get a good grade on the test' and that anger is actually fear'" Kinsey said. "That anger is fear and what Rachel is doing in such a beautiful way is saying ''if you don't get in touch with that you're not really modeling for girls what they need.' "Muffy Flouret who has a daughter in the seventh grade at Hewitt said Simmons is helping students and parents understand what it means to fail and how to bounce back. "She's on the edge of the research of how do we raise girls in the community and it's invaluable because parents who might not think twice about saying 'Well you didn't get the A. I'm not so happy about that' might now think twice about that reaction" Flouret said.She also said Simmons is helping the community understand the perils of trying to be the best at everything."To create this sort of pressure that you have to be the top of the soccer team and you have to be top of the debate team it's not sustainable and it's not realistic" she said. "Where does that leave you as an adult? You have to be able to bounce back and react to things."Jo-Anne Williams co-chairwoman of the Hewitt Parents' Association who has a daughter in the seventh grade at the school attends nearly every one of Simmons' events with parents. "It really causes you to take a step back and say 'What am I really doing? Am I just trying to create a cookie cutter of myself or (what) I want her to be?' " Williams said. "I worked in finance. I was always strong in certain subjects that she doesn't happen to like all that much. Am I pressuring her too much on math because that's not her thing? She's a dancer. She's a great writer. She's other things."Williams said her daughter recently told her mother that she chews her fingernails because she's a perfectionist."I said 'Well I used to chew my fingernails when I was a kid' and I said 'I stopped doing it. And I also used to be a perfectionist and I've stopped doing that so there's hope for you.' ",Health
Go Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life for ourselves and our children through useful paradigms and best practices. Share your insight at the CNN Parenting Facebook page. (CNN)Without meaning to my wife and I conducted an A-B experiment while disciplining our two children. They are 4½ years apart and somewhere in that gap -- thanks to the suggestions of the progressive mindful parenting books we regularly consume -- we did away with the popular refuge of nearly all parents (probably since the dawn of time): the "timeout." As some Neanderthal dad probably yelled "Go to your part of the cave until you've calmed down!"The arguments for the timeout boil down to: 1. It's better than spanking. (True.) 2. Parents want a little time away from a child's aggravating behavior. (No doubt.) Timeouts have been popular for decades and are still recommended by some parenting experts. But it's time to add the timeout to the parental dust bin of history along with yelling hitting and missing school in order to help run the farm.Here is the fundamental failure of the timeout: It's tantamount to abandoning your kid when they need you most. If they're acting up it may be to get your attention. If they are upset or angry they want you to connect with them (even if they push you away). Your calm listening presence or a long hug -- not isolation -- is what they need to reconnect to their rational brain.These moments just after upsetting behavior and anger -- yours and theirs -- can move a parent-child relationship closer or farther apart.Need some solid social science to convince you? The National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study in 1982 (the timeout method hasn't changed since then) that found kids who had timeouts -- or "love withdrawal" as the study's authors also called the method -- were more misbehaved even when moms in the study talked to their kids after their timeout reflection.Premier parenting academic Alfie Kohn has written extensively about the negative effects on a child's moral and psychological development due to timeouts and other love-withdrawal techniques. He cites child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim who concluded that timeouts can cause "deep feelings of anxiety." And if you're telling yourself a timeout is not a punishment but rather a much-needed break for reflection and self-calming let me ask you: Does your child think it's a punishment? If so then it is.Describing timeouts in their book "How to Talk so Kids Can Learn" Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish write "As an adult you can imagine how resentful and humiliated you would feel if someone forced you into isolation for something you said or did."What's the alternative?I bet most parents who use the timeout -- which seems to work in the short run (perhaps because it triggers a child's fear of abandonment according to developmental psychologist Aletha Solter) -- do so because it's expedient. If we had an alternative that worked more effectively and just as swiftly we'd gladly use it.The answer is "time-ins." That sounds too cute to be real advice but maybe it's just catchy enough that you will remember it when you're driven to the point of anger and not thinking straight yourself. Fight the urge to push your troubled kid away and work to embrace them instead.When you remove the option of distance and solitude you have no choice but to engage. That step by the way is often all it takes to stop the behavior. But you can also help them calm themselves; a few deep breaths is remarkably effective.And then you both can find a solution together as a team instead of in opposition. Listen fully and patiently to their version of the story. And talk about mitigating factors. Are they hungry angry lonely tired stressed or sick (a list that forms the handy acronym HALTSS)? Sometimes there are no solutions. We all just need to be heard sometimes. After you understand where they're coming from try reflecting their feelings back to them. "You feel sad that the playdate has to end." "That's so frustrating when a plan doesn't work out like we hoped."Time-ins demonstrate to them you care even when times get tough. It conveys the message that their "bad" emotions (which are really just difficult yet perfectly natural ones) are as acceptable as their pleasant happy emotions. Time-ins also teach kids to pay closer attention to their feelings and needs and get better at finding solutions to their problems. These moments -- when reflexively a timeout seems the easiest route -- are great parenting opportunities to connect (aka love) and teach life skills. Sometimes especially with older kids they may genuinely want you to go away. But stay close. Maybe refrain from talking. If you leave the room check in after a bit.My wife and I give ourselves timeouts on occasion when we need a break. But sending yourself away is not the same as abandoning them especially if you explain your emotional state before you excuse yourself. You are modeling the fact that everyone needs to give themselves recovery breaks (whether it's 30 seconds or 30 minutes). Your kids may use it as a model for themselves.Experiment: Give up timeouts for a monthI'm guessing you won't be convinced that time-ins are more effective than timeouts unless you give it a try. See what happens when you issue no timeouts for a month. It may be a mess at first but I'm convinced you'll see some significant results within a month.Our home experiment had similar results as the National Institute of Mental Health study. If timeouts were effective our younger child (who never got one) would be a terror. And our older one would have acted out more when we ceased to deploy them. But neither happened. In fact we doubled down and largely did away with punishments altogether. The net result has been less confrontation more cohesion more solutions.Our first daughter is 10 years old and has recently started the tween-age rite of passage of occasionally storming off to her room. Sometimes she adds the slammed door as a kinetic exclamation mark. It's a timeout of a different of color -- one she imposes on herself. But my wife or I will check in after a few minutes and see whether she wants to talk. Sometimes I need to apologize if I'm the one who her upset her. But if she still wants to be by herself we respect that. She knows we're nearby always ready for when she needs a time-in. David G.

(CNN)Every January for the past 20 years I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question "what is the meaning of life?"It's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous. This simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9000 participants over age 65 and another among 6000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life whether it was personal (like happiness) creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.The connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress as other research has shown) but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.The reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer I believe only answers that are right for you at any given time. Great thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle the Greek philosopher who lived 2500 years ago is believed to have written that the essence of life is "to serve others and to do good" and the Roman philosopher Cicero born 280 years later came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy who wrote "The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity." And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added "if you can't help them at least don't hurt them."Scottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said "The true meaning of life is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit." And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to "throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.""Love" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded "The meaning of life is not simply to exist to survive but to move ahead to go up to achieve to conquer."My favorite answer though is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne who put it "The purpose of life is a life of purpose."Some have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. "There is not one big cosmic meaning for all" Anaïs Nin wrote in her diary. "There is only the meaning we each give to our life an individual meaning an individual plot like an individual novel a book for each person." I agree which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. "Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exupéry well-known for his book "The Little Prince."Taking a few moments to record your answer to the question "what is the meaning of life?" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life. And then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding. In 1997 my answer was "the discovery pursuit and attainment of one's bliss" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later is was to make "the world a better place." In 2002 the year I got engaged it was simply "Love." And the year we conceived our oldest daughter it was the less-romantic "continuation of one's DNA to the next generation." But most years my answer is some combination of love legacy happiness experience and helping others. As a practical matter if you want to do the annual "Meaning" exercise I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper and keep it someplace safe.The last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude as Tolstoy and Aristotle did that the meaning of life to help others that should help motivate you to do more of it. If "love" is the answer then love more. If it's "find your bliss" then get searching for it.This is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful and longer life.,Health

As a species we are impressively committed to self-improvement and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.Habits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress. "Habit is a good servant but a bad master" is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book "Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives." Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit" and Jeremy Dean's "Making Habits Breaking Habits." Together they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control how to choose a habit to begin or end and the mechanics of sticking with it. The first thing to know each book explained is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote they are automatic. "All our life ... is but a mass of habits" philosopher and psychologist William James wrote though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40%. Still that's a lot of mindless behavior.It's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks we'd get little else done. The whole trick is to get habits to work for you not against you. Self-control is a limited resource Dean explains so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing. Room to growThe first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.This step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?We know what many of the most common areas of improvement are at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight eat better be more mindful spend money more wisely sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones you can succeed in most of these areas.One helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions research has shown are Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant and Time-bound. Before finishing the first book (Dean's which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based) I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start the other a bad habit to quit.Rubin who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy marriage a medical diagnosis a family death an anniversary a long trip or a new year.Repeal and replace your behaviorThe consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example many people stop smoking by chewing gum. The point is that bad habits die hard and as with riding a bike your brain never stops learning how to do them.So it's easier to think about any habit formation even new "good" ones in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts dried papaya instead of chocolate sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern. To be more mindful with my kids I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.Duhigg explains that habit "reversal therapy" is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder as well as predilections such as gambling smoking and bed-wetting.It's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction however even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking. Dean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: 5 genius morning routine habits as told by 5 of the world's most successful peopleThe wonderful thing about triggersWe like to think we have free will in every situation but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings such as stress or boredom. Being aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?You can help create conditions to avoid triggers but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained maybe going back years it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations you need contingencies. Dean calls them  "If ... then ..." plans. When trigger X happens I won't do bad habit Y as I usually do but I will replace it with much healthier Z action. My favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.You likewise need to have a plan for when a strong perhaps rare trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily I can avoid eating cupcakes at work but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch it's late afternoon I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter? 66 is the magic number According to one study cited by Dean and Rubin it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.I avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as "be more present with my kids" can be numerically self-scored every evening. And another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved or even just aware makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.Treat yo'self: rewardsUnlike tracking and accountability incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit. For me rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system.If you do treat yourself for keeping a habit make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward say avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream. And that's one to grow onAt the end of 66 days I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.The real test though is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying. Rubin would call it "stumbling" and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.You may want to read one of the habit books too. The three overlap and support each other but my personal preference was for Rubin's largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking introspection and applied psychology. She's the author of the bestselling "The Happiness Project" and wrote this new book she explained after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.But I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin whose advice would make all these books unnecessary. " 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them" he wrote.,Health
 (CNN)It's a precious moment for families around the world when twilight falls children yawn and bedtime routines engage.Yet the places where children sleep the time they lay down at night and even how they prepare for shut-eye vary across cultures. Even differences in children's bedrooms around the world can be striking as in Venice-based photographer James Mollison's photo series "Where Children Sleep" which has been adapted into a book.Though it has been nearly seven years since the series was published the photographs still spark conversation as they turn a lens to bedtime around the globe.While photographing the series "I met many families who sleep together in one room or children who sleep in a space of convenience rather than a place they can in any sense call their room" Mollison said."I came to appreciate just how privileged I was to have had my own bedroom to sleep in and grow" he said. "I met children who had literally nothing except for a place to sleep and other children who couldn't move for all their toys."Here is a sampling of what bedtime looks like in households around the world.Drastic differences in babies' bedtimesWhile researching children's sleep across the globe clinical psychologist Jodi Mindell was surprised to discover significant differences in bedtimes for infants and toddlers based on where they lived.She described the differences as "unbelievable.""When I walked into doing this study I really thought we would see 10- or 15-minute differences" said Mindell a professor at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia and associate director of the Sleep Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.It turned out however "we're seeing these 2½-hour differences between some countries like Australia and New Zealand with other countries like Hong Kong and Korea" she said. "Bedtimes ranged dramatically across cultures."Mindell and her colleagues analyzed how the parents of 29287 infants and toddlers up to 3 years old responded to questionnaires about their children's bedtimes. Those findings were published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2010.The parents were from China Hong Kong India Indonesia Korea Japan Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Taiwan Thailand Vietnam Australia Canada New Zealand the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006 September and December 2007 and April 2008. The researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m. whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m. on average.The study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.Bedtimes also appear to vary across European countries said Sara Harkness a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture Health and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.She was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes."We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact on one occasion our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m." Harkness said."The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed often in their own room" she said. On the other hand "in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya where we did research in the 1970s babies were always in close proximity to caretakers generally their mother or an older sibling and they slept anywhere and any time" she said.Around the world there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.Parents try it all to get babies to sleepIn the United States it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or for older kids a book.Yet around the world bedtime routines involve a different approach and in some places they appear to be less common."One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine for 0-3 some type of feeding whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks and that's consistent across all countries but if we take that out there's big differences in activities like bathing" Mindell said citing her own research.In the US "60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India only 13%. In Indonesia it's only 6%" she said. "They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day."There are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers Mindell added."In the Philippines 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine" she said. "Whereas some place like Australia only 6% did. In Indonesia 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine."Once the time comes to actually get some shut-eye parents use different approaches to get their children to sleep.In Korea Harkness said parents often sleep with their babies to help them drift into dreamland but Dutch parents tend to leave their babies alone in their rooms where the children must learn to put themselves to sleep."The Dutch parents in our studies strongly supported a cultural rule of the 'Three R's' of childrearing -- rust regelmaat en reinheid or 'rest regularity and cleanliness' -- which entailed establishing a firm routine featuring plenty of sleep on a regular schedule from an early age" Harkness said.Who bed-shares and who doesn'tSimilar differences emerge among bed-sharing practices."Co-sleeping is the usual practice in preindustrial societies around the world where there are no special beds for babies to sleep safely by themselves. Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room" Harkness said."We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice" she said.In the United States the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says "there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' ""The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance especially from pediatricians about avoiding co-sleeping" Harkness said. "This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation."'Bedtime routines are the perfect package'All in all bedtime routines can benefit a child's development Mindell said."Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep but for promoting positive child development" Mindell said. "Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better but it also promotes things like literacy attachment language bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States" she said.,Health
 (CNN)"My Brilliant Friend" lives up to its adjective creating such a rich exquisitely rendered plunge into mid-20th-century Naples that it's difficult not to get totally sucked into the hardscrabble small-village lives. Shot in Italian after watching six of the eight episodes there's not much to say but "fantastico."Adapted from the bestselling book by Elena Ferrante who worked on the scripts with director Saverio Costanzo and others and produced in concert with European networks the production has done a masterful job of preserving the writer's voice. The real triumph though is in the casting especially the young actresses who play the central characters at different ages.Like the book the story begins by flashing back as Elena now in her 60s is informed that her one-time bosom pal Lila has disappeared. Sounding more resigned than surprised she quickly begins reminiscing about their upbringing when the two were the smartest girls in their class during a time of post-war upheaval and poverty when girls weren't encouraged to study or seek to elevate their station beyond that of their parents.Fearless rebellious and more than a little mysterious Lila (Ludovica Nasti) exhibits a powerful hold over Elena (Elisa Del Genio) inspired a mix of admiration and envy. They reside in a town where there's little ostensible authority and the working people struggle to get by while living in fear of characters like the loan-shark Don Achille who Elena's narration describes as "the ogre of fairy tales."The girls' friendship however grows deeper as they bond by reading "Little Women" together ("It was our book and we loved it dearly") before puberty begins to complicate their lives with Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace taking over the roles.Elena manages to convince her family to let her stay in school while Lila doesn't; nevertheless Lila continues to read and educate herself even as she blossoms into a much-in-demand beauty resisting the advances of the well-to-do boy that's pursuing her.The project's brilliance most often comes in small but illuminating scenes such as the look on the face of Elena's father when he tries introducing her to a wealthy man at his work only to be bluntly dismissed. Ferrante also deals with issues of class and inequality filtered through a period of tumult where turning to communism is among the alternatives.While the lives shown aren't glamorous the meticulous nature of the village makes it a place you want to visit -- whether the passage is booked by travel agent or time machine.HBO has enjoyed a good deal of success with its limited series many of them driven by high-profile stars a la "Big Little Lies." Here the book is the centerpiece and the setting and performances make it possible to escape almost entirely into the sometimes aching sometimes stirring almost invariably beautiful world of "My Brilliant Friend.""My Brilliant Friend" premieres Nov. 18 at 9 p.m. on HBO with the eight episodes airing Sundays and Mondays over four weeks.,Entertainment
 (CNN)In case you've missed the memo feelings are big on TV right now. From NBC's weekly tear duct workout "This Is Us" to Netflix's emotion-stirring "Queer Eye" audiences are down to be uplifted. Enter "Dogs" a six-episode docuseries poised to become the latest feel-good must-view. As the title indicates the characters at the center of this global tale about one of life's most unbreakable bonds have tails. In the second episode viewers meet Zeus a Siberian Husky trapped in Syria whose owner is willing to go to great lengths to be reunited. Another episode takes viewers to Lake Como where an Italian fisherman's 10-year-old lab Ice could melt even the most frozen heart. Then there's Max a loyal canine who lives in a Costa Rican rainforest with 1000 other dogs saved from streets by a determined group of rescuers.  The series also introduces viewers to a number of heroes the kind that are partial to fur instead of capes -- like a woman who drives potential canine adoptees across the country in hopes of finding them forever homes in rescue-friendly New York City."I really was excited about the idea that you could enter worlds that you might not have access to through the love of a dog and see the connection there" executive producer Amy Berg who also directed two of the installments told CNN. (In addition to Berg critically hailed directors Roger Ross Williams Heidi Ewing Richard Hankin and T.J. Martin and Daniel Lindsay also helm episodes.) Related: The unbridled joy of dogs catching treats The connection between an owner and their dog -- and at times heroes and every dog -- is largely the source of the magic in and beauty of "Dogs."Simply put: There's a lot of dog-human hugs awww-worthy snout close-ups and a beautiful score that will make any effort to keep emotional composure well ruff. The social media reaction to the "Dogs' trailer -- which if the comments are any indication left a lot of people crying at their desks at work -- caused executive producer Glen Zipper to feel compelled to clarify at every opportunity that "it's not a sad show.""We're very very cautious about giving anyone any spoilers but suffice it to say Amy and I are equally uncomfortable with seeing anything terribly sad or animal put way" he said. "We made a series through that lens and while there might be some challenging moments across the series I think everyone will walk away from each episode feeling pretty happy." He added: "We think they're good cries." The endings seen in the episodes are also not too far removed from the present-day. The last shooting day for the series was in late May -- just a few months ago."They're pretty much hot off the presses" Zipper said. The six episodes were filmed and edited over eight short months. The hardest part was seemingly choosing which stories to feature. They're eager to do more -- if the present-day craving for TV that inspires feelings of joy attracts an audience large enough to earn them a green light from Netflix. "We're living in such divisive times right now it seems like our bond with dogs is something that is so universal and no matter what end of the political spectrum you're on. No matter what your belief system it's one thing that we're all connected to" Zipper said. "And in that one idyllic uniformity of love that we all experience hopefully we can find a little bit more than we have in common with each other through this show.",Entertainment

West gave through the GoFundMe page made to raise money for the funeral of Jemel Roberson 26 far exceeding the goal. Bart Jackson a representative for GoFundMe confirmed the contribution.

 (CNN)The very busy Alex Gibney has two documentary series premiering Sunday night and in a way they're complementary: "The Clinton Affair" looks at events leading to President Clinton's impeachment -- featuring an extensive interview with Monica Lewinsky -- while "Enemies: The President Justice & the FBI" explores a history of such clashes with an eye very much on the White House's current occupant.Both projects tackle the questions raised by investigating presidents the use of special prosecutors and the need for independent curbs on executive power which isn't exactly a veiled referendum on what's happening now. The four-part "Enemies" -- inspired by Tim Weiner's book -- extends through the current Russia investigation so much so that Showtime noted the near-100-minute finale will still be tweaked right up until air time.Granted a six-part documentary might seem like a lot to devote to "The Clinton Affair" but the filmmakers flesh out the narrative by interviewing most of the key players foremost among them Lewinsky. What emerges is a comprehensive portrait of not only Bill and Hillary Clinton but the forces arrayed against them and how the former's behavior "handed the sword to his enemies."Timed to the 20th anniversary of those proceedings Gibney and director Blair Foster have the latitude to go back to Clinton's election including the accusation of infidelity that emerged during the campaign.Later the film chronicles the lawsuit brought by Paula Jones against Clinton and how the president's refusal to settle the case ultimately let the Lewinsky relationship and Clinton's lies about it become a threat to his presidency.The title notwithstanding "The Clinton Affair" derives much of its power from Lewinsky discussing the beginnings of her relationship with the president -- and all the clandestine activity that entailed -- her betrayal by Linda Tripp and the realization she was going to be dragged into the public eye.Lewinsky says she hopes new documentary will ensure her experience 'never happens to another young person'Lewinsky treads gingerly around the intimate aspects of her story. But her composure breaks when recalling being interrogated by FBI agents asking to speak with her mother and feeling "scared and mortified" about the public maelstrom that awaited her.The most telling observation has to do with the way the Clintons responded to the onslaught of attacks aimed at them and how being the constant targets of political invective colored their reactions in a way that often reflected badly on them. Those tendencies -- forged during his presidency -- can't help but echo through thoughts the email scandal that hovered over her 2016 campaign.The documentary also sheds light on other issues including feminism media and pop culture. There's jarring footage for example of late-night hosts mocking Jones in a wince-inducing manner -- depicting her with a fake nose on "The Tonight Show."The Clintons aren't interviewed but enough friends lawyers and confidants are to provide a glimpse of their view from inside the fishbowl. And even when it doesn't say so "The Clinton Affair" effectively conveys that what transpired 20 years ago isn't mere history; rather the ripples are still being very much felt today.Similarly "Enemies" begins with J. Edgar Hoover's iron-fisted reign at the FBI before getting into the meat of the narrative rifling through Watergate the Iran-Contra affair and Clinton investigation. The four-part project then culminates with an extended finale devoted heavily to former FBI director James Comey -- first in his 2004 clash with President George W. Bush's administration over authorizing domestic surveillance and his subsequent firing by Trump.Comey refused an interview but his self-narrated book-on-tape offers plenty of perspective augmented by the likes of former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden and former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.In its totality "Enemies" delivers a reminder -- again not subtle in its intent -- that executive authority has repeatedly tested constitutional boundaries moments that call upon the justice system to step forward and safeguard democratic ideals."The FBI wasn't going to be pushed around by the Nixon administration" Weiner notes in the opening chapter. It's a decades-old showdown but like most of "The Clinton Affair" and "Enemies: The President Justice & the FBI" it feels designed more like an extended preview of coming attractions. "The Clinton Affair" will air Nov. 18-20 at 9 p.m. on A&E. "Enemies: The President Justice & the FBI" premieres Nov. 18 at 8 p.m. on Showtime.,Entertainment
 (CNN)"Green Book" can't avoid "Driving Miss Daisy" comparisons and probably doesn't want to as the film -- amid unease about political polarization and racial division -- conspicuously strives to be uplifting and bridge building. To the extent it achieves those objectives credit Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali whose performances bring humanity and dimension to this fact-based road movie despite the predictable nature of its narrative journey."Green Book" owes a more recent and perhaps larger debt to "Hidden Figures" which also filtered early-1960s civil rights through an inspiring true story. Yet while that hit aimed for the stars this one focuses on a smaller more idiosyncratic story that relies almost exclusively on its leads.Director Peter Farrelly -- a name usually associated with screwball comedy -- appears to be an unlikely choice to oversee such an enterprise. The film however tackles its subject matter with a good deal of grace even if the script has its share of knocks and pings especially in the early going.A key footnote involves the deeply personal nature of the project. The screenplay is credited to Nick Vallelonga -- the son of Mortensen's character Tony Vallelonga -- along with Farrelly and Brian Currie and in flipping the "Miss Daisy" formula spends a bit of time spinning its wheels before getting into gear.It's 1962 and Tony -- basically a glorified bouncer at the Copacabana in New York well connected among the shady swells who frequent the joint -- needs a gig to tide him over financially while the club is closed for repairs.Already revealed to be a racist (he throws away glasses used by black repairmen badmouthing them in Italian) Tony is taken aback when an opportunity arises to serve as a driver and bodyguard for Don Shirley (Ali) the brilliant leader of a musical trio. The piano virtuoso has agreed to a tour of the Deep South but his record company fears the dangers that an African American might encounter will require the services of someone with Tony's skill set.Tony reluctantly takes the job and is presented the Green Book a guide to motels and restaurants that accommodate African-American travelers in the South. One needn't be clairvoyant to anticipate that the two men -- as different as they could possibly be with Tony loud and boorish while Don is quiet and genteel -- will bond over the course of their eight-week pre-Christmas trek which separates Tony from his wife (Linda Cardellini) and kids.Tony is a bruiser who loves eating and Mortensen has obligingly layered on pounds "Raging Bull"-style to fill out those undershirts. On screen he wolfs down meals in a manner that becomes one of the film's better running gags.It's easy to wish "Green Book" itself wasn't quite so ham-fisted at times or on-the-nose with its dialogue. But taken on its own terms the movie possesses hard-to-resist warmth in its underlying theme and welcome humor in the mismatched buddy dynamic -- with Don attempting to make Tony less of a philistine while the driver introduces his meticulous boss to deep-fried foods.Obviously positioned as awards bait "Green Book" the movie doesn't rise to that level but the performances by Mortensen (already a two-time Oscar nominee) and Ali (a well-deserved Oscar winner for supporting actor in "Moonlight") won't be easily ignored. (Mortensen's use of a racial epithet during a panel discussion of the film for which he apologized in a way reinforces its timeliness.)"Dignity always prevails" Don tells Tony whose preferred response to a slight is usually to crack heads.It's a reassuring thought especially amid debate over how far we've come as a society in the nearly six decades since the events depicted in the film. Thanks to the hopefulness at the heart of Tony's personal journey the very dignified "Green Book" might indeed come out a winner."Green Book" premieres in limited U.S. release Nov. 16 and expands Nov. 21. It's rated PG-13.,Entertainment
 (CNN)More workmanlike than magical "Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald" nevertheless feels like an upgrade from its predecessor one that adds star power introduces key characters and lays the foundation for a genuine "Wizarding World" franchise. To call J.K. Rowling's mythology-heavy plot dense would be an understatement but the film has enough epic heft to feel like a genuine blockbuster.Rowling reunites with David Yates the director of four "Harry Potter" movies as well as "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them." The marquee additions meanwhile including a toothy role for Johnny Depp (after what amounted to a fleeting cameo) and the introduction of Jude Law as a younger Albus Dumbledore which along with some other familiar names moves this brand expansion closer to the realm of "Star Wars" prequels.As for Eddie Redmayne the ostensible star as the halting vulnerable love-struck Newt Scamander his role recedes a bit partly overwhelmed by the swirl of characters around him and the need for long expository passages which practically require a scorecard.To briefly recap "Fantastic Beasts" ended with the evil dangerous Grindelwald not only captured but revealed to be Depp whetting appetites for the sequel to come. Not to disappoint the movie opens with a spectacular escape sequence as the American Ministry of Magic proves itself to be pretty incompetent (insert your own joke here) in the prisoner-transfer department.Having Grindelwald on the loose presents a challenge for Newt who is caught up in the world of wizardly politics a complicated web to say the least. He's prodded by Dumbledore to pursue the fugitive leading him his muggle pal Jacob (Dan Fogler) and the Ministry of Magic's Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) on a hell-bent chase across Paris in the 1920s.That basic template barely scratches the surface of all that's going on with enough flashbacks name-checks and key secondary players -- including Ezra Miller as Credence the mysterious linchpin of Grindelwald's master plan; and Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) Newt's childhood love now destined to wed his brother -- adding layers of intrigue.Depp gives the movie a villain of a greater magnitude particularly in a closing sequence where he reveals what motivates him. While Dumbledore isn't around that much as played by Law he's as enigmatic as ever strengthening the link to Potter lore especially for the rules-of-Quidditch-conversant who eat up every reference to it.Rowling's script periodically screeches to a halt to putty in those storylines a tactic perhaps more conducive to novels than movies. Still "Fantastic Beasts" doesn't scrimp on the action with enough battles chases and imaginative production design and creatures -- augmented by a particularly good James Newton Howard score -- to occupy those Muggles who mostly just like to see stuff blow up.Like the Harry Potter franchise which built in ambition and intensity while piling on British talent as the central trio aged "Fantastic Beasts" is settling in for a long ride with three more movies announced through 2024.It's pretty clear that run will be profitable for Warner Bros. (like CNN a unit of WarnerMedia). To the extent "The Crimes of Grindelwald" displays more franchise-driven efficiency than spark it's best viewed less as a stand-alone film than a carefully orchestrated step into the larger pre-Harry world."Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald" opens Nov. 16 in the U.S. It's rated PG-13.,Entertainment
 (CNN)Traditional print outlets are understandably starry-eyed about finding new ways to cash in on their content compensating for a dwindling business model. Enter "Dirty John" a Bravo event series adapted from the salacious multi-part Los Angeles Times articles and podcast which -- the classy underpinnings notwithstanding -- basically plays like an old-school Lifetime movie just stretched into episodic form.The casting certainly helps elevate the material with Connie Britton ("Friday Night Lights") as Debra Newell the successful career woman swept off her feet by John Meehan (Eric Bana) who she meets through a dating service. A whirlwind romance ensues despite the skepticism -- when not outright hostility -- of her friends and family understandably concerned that it's all too soon too fast.The main problem with "Dirty John" though -- both the character and the series -- is that as structured here his web of lies begin unraveling pretty quickly. Yes it's Eric Bana (sigh) but Britton's not exactly chopped liver which makes her character's blinders when it comes to seeing John's flaws feel as if they strain credulity -- even knowing it's a true story -- as questions keep mounting about his claims of being a doctor his war history and so on.Complicating matters is Debra's relationship with her daughters (Juno Temple and Julia Garner) who "hate him" Debra laments and start seeking to uncover the truth.Connie Britton's in a toxic relationship in 'Dirty John' trailerPositioned as a longform thriller when it become a sensation in print and podcast the series comes across as more mundane perhaps because women being manipulated by lying no-good men is such a familiar staple of the fact-based drama. (It's also popular in documentaries and sister network Oxygen has its own companion project "Dirty John: The Dirty Truth" scheduled to air in January.)Jean Smart also turns up as Debra's mom but through the episodes previewed it's largely Britton and Bana's showcase and they help make the series watchable enough even if it doesn't feel particularly distinctive or special.There's a temptation to endorse anything that supports investigative journalism and the Times receives a production credit on the series which carries the requisite disclaimer about certain events having been altered for dramatic purposes. That's not the kind of thing that's considered kosher in newspapers but when you get into bed with Hollywood you generally wind up playing by their rules."Dirty John" premieres Nov. 25 at 10 p.m. on Bravo. The premiere is available online via YouTube and Bravo's web site.,Entertainment
 (CNN)"The Kominsky Method" is ostensibly one of those Hollywood productions about Hollywood but really this Netflix comedy -- starring Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin from "The Big Bang Theory" co-creator Chuck Lorre -- is about two more universal themes: friendship and getting older. On those levels the show proves breezy and likable and about as far from the ad-supported pressure to reach "younger demos" as a TV show can get.Douglas plays Sandy Kominsky a renowned acting coach who gives brilliant advice to his classes -- who pepper him with questions about things like auditioning for a shampoo commercial -- but could use a bit of his own when it comes to his personal affairs.Kominsky tells his charges that they should act for the love of their craft "not the pursuit of fame or money." But he's in desperate need of the latter a source of consternation to his longtime agent and bosom pal Norman (Arkin).Although Kominsky embarks on a relationship with one of his students -- a relatively age-appropriate woman (Nancy Travis) to the surprise of those who know him -- it's the banter between Douglas and Arkin that defines the show and consistently delivers its best moments. The two even engage in an amusing "Who's on first?"-type routine built around the rapper Ludacris (Kominsky has no idea who that is) and is later told by an exasperated Norman "I'm not sugarcoating. I'm lying."Over the course of the eight-episode run Kominsky and Norman deal with all the vagaries of getting older from death to a prostate cancer scare as the acting coach becomes alarmed over his frequent trips to the bathroom. A trip to the urologist played by Danny DeVito leads to more one-liners and groaning about life's little indignities on the wrong side of middle age.Produced by Lorre (who also directed the premiere) with Al Higgins and David Javerbaum nothing here is especially new. But much like Netflix's other over-the-hill comedy "Grace and Frankie" it's an amusing look at aging grudgingly not gracefully -- more about the talent and situations than the premise. As a bonus addressing a time of life given short shrift by youth-obsessed media creates the opportunity for cameos and smaller roles by the likes of Susan Sullivan and Ann-Margret.)The series also incorporates a number of very insider-ish jokes that will play best among Angelenos in the 310 area code like a Hollywood-friendly restaurant where the waiters are so old it's a dice roll if the food's ever going to reach the table.There are some sweeter more melancholy scenes among the laughs which arrive consistently enough to make "The Kominsky Method" feel like a significant improvement over Lorre's first single-camera Netflix comedy the Kathy Bates vehicle "Disjointed." And happily it doesn't require lying -- or even sugarcoating -- to say so."The Kominsky Method" premieres Nov. 16 on Netflix.,Entertainment
 (CNN)A 1928 Disney animation which predates the creation of Mickey Mouse has been unearthed in Japan according to Japanese media. The Asahi Shimbun reports that the cartoon short entitled "Neck n' Neck" was part of the collection of an anime history researcher Yasushi Watanabe who bought it in Osaka while still a high school student some 70 years ago. At the time the film which had been given the Japanese title "Mickey Manga Spide" or Mickey cartoon speedy cost ¥500 ($4.40 at current exchange rates).It features a character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit who in the two-minute consumer version owned by the researcher is chased by a dog traffic cop while on a date. A longer version of five minutes was also produced. The find came about after Watanabe read "Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons" by former Disney animator David Bossert which details the history of the character and notes that a number of the early animations had disappeared. Despite his profession prior to reading the book Watanabe was unaware of how rare -- and significant -- the film was.  Suspecting that his copy may be one of the missing films Watanabe worked with the Asahi Shimbun to contact Bossert and the Walt Disney Archives which confirmed that the film was indeed one of the missing works. "As I've been a Disney fan for many years I'm happy that I was able to play a role (in the discovery)" Watanabe said."We're absolutely delighted to learn that a copy of the lost film exists" Becky Cline director of Walt Disney Archives told the newspaper. A shorter clip of the film was also unearthed in the Toy Film Museum in Kyoto as a result of Bossert's book the Asahi Shimbun article reports.Oswald was phased out by Disney after legal wrangling over the character's rights led to another company gaining control over the creation -- described in Disney archives as a "brazen theft" -- leading the famed cartoonist to devise another animal-based character -- Mickey Mouse -- in 1928. November 18 marks the 90th anniversary of the premiere of "Steamboat Willie" the first public appearance of arguably the most famous cartoon character in the world and the mainstay of what would become one of the world's largest entertainment companies. ,Entertainment
 (CNN)"Widows" is a wildly uneven crime caper one with more valleys than peaks. Juggling too many threads the film delivers strong and twisty moments -- and a feminist hook -- but largely squanders its impressive array of talent headed by Viola Davis.The plot actually has a pretty basic backbone to it and a durable one at that. Originally a 1980s British miniseries from "Prime Suspect" creator Lynda La Plante it was remade 20 years later and bears a resemblance to NBC's recent series "Good Girls" in which three suburban women have to resort to crime.As the title suggests the women here are the widows of a heist gone wrong which ended with their husbands dying in a fiery crash. Veronica (Davis) has the most to lose since a local crime boss Jamal Manning ("Atlanta's" Brian Tyree Henry) is the one who was robbed and he wants his $2 million back in a month's time or else.Veronica's husband Harry (Liam Neeson) had been a master thief enabling the couple to live in luxury. But dark aspects of their past gradually emerge even as Veronica discovers a book that maps out Harry's next planned job deciding to undertake it with the other widows --all left financially bereft by the deaths -- in order to make Veronica's Manning problem go away and get themselves solvent again."This is not your world" Veronica is warned which in the women's determination to prove that wrong is just one of the female-empowerment elements at play.All that would be enough seemingly to give "Widows" a strong narrative hook including the personal stories of the other widows played by Michelle Rodriguez Elizabeth Debicki ("The Night Manager") and Carrie Coon ("The Leftovers").Condensing the miniseries into movie form however overwhelms the script by director Steve McQueen ("12 Years a Slave") and "Gone Girl" novelist Gillian Flynn which also takes several detours -- including race gun violence and Chicago politics as Manning tries to go legit by running for alderman against a privileged son (Colin Farrell) whose family has run things in the ward for decades.The strength of the casting notably goes well beyond that including Cynthia Erivo -- who joins the plot too late in the game to fully register -- Daniel Kaluuya ("Get Out") as Jamal's ruthless henchman and Robert Duvall as Farrell's imperious father.Davis -- grieving angry and a virtual force of nature -- provides the movie with a sturdy core and she's the best incentive to see it. Yet even she gets lost at times amid the maelstrom of events swirling around her and while the script brings the pieces together the ending feels rushed and unsatisfying after all the meticulous "Ocean's"-movie-style planning and buildup."Widows" in some respects feels like a throwback -- an old-fashioned intricately plotted crime thriller that's more about characters than explosions. Much like the heist scheme though the movie looks better on paper ultimately then it does in the execution."Widows" opens Nov. 16 in the U.S. It's rated R.,Entertainment

 (CNN)The miniseries is in full flower right now offering major stars willing to commit to six or seven episodes but not open-ended runs. Enter two such projects both dealing as it happens in sexual manipulation: "Escape at Dannemora" -- a stranger-than-fiction prison escape story airing on Showtime -- and AMC's "The Little Drummer Girl" which expands John le Carre's espionage novel into a sharply drawn six-part international thriller."Dannemora" feels like the more distinctive tale even if it unfolds at what initially feels like a snail's pace painstakingly recounting the 2015 escape of Richard Matt (Benicio Del Toro) and David Sweat (Paul Dano) from the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York. The two are aided by prison worker Joyce "Tilly" Mitchell (Patricia Arquette) who despite being married to one of the guards had sexual relationships with both of them.Tilly is the most fascinating character filled with need and unhappiness and Arquette fearlessly plays this wholly unflattering role with absolute abandon. Her trysts with Matt in the machine shop -- essentially an open secret among the inmates -- might be the least glamorous sex ever put on screen and only become stranger when she moves on to Matt after Sweat is reassigned.Directed by Ben Stiller with an emphasis on authenticity "Dannemora" makes clear Tilly wasn't the only one bedazzled by Matt with the ever-reliable David Morse as a guard who provides him with protection and privileges in exchange for his remarkable artwork. The later episodes focusing on the escape essentially play like a more protracted version of "The Shawshank Redemption" with the added proviso that when it comes to prison escapes one ought to avoid assistance from people who don't keep secrets very well.Mostly the project serves as a showcase for the actors. They provide plenty of reason to watch but like Matt's elaborate plan when it comes to "Escape at Dannemora" patience is required as well as rewarded."The Little Drummer Girl" also features formidable star power with Michael Shannon and Alexander Skarsgard as the Israeli operatives that recruit a young actress Charlie ("Lady Macbeth's" Florence Pugh) to infiltrate a Palestinian terrorist cell in the late 1970s.The opportunity presents itself when they capture a terrorist leader one who seduces young European women before using them to plant bombs -- a tactic demonstrated at the outset in horrifying detail.The tradeoff is that the Israelis must engage in their own questionable behavior to convince Charlie to literally play along with Skarsgard as the conflicted warrior whose own seductive powers are brought to bear as he seeks to train Charlie to survive the gauntlet of suspicion she's destined to face.Fundamentally "Little Drummer Girl" probes longstanding questions about battling terrorism and the extent to which those seeking to thwart attacks are willing to go even if it means sacrificing innocents in the name of the cause. It's an exercise in moral ambiguity in a way that brings to mind not only le Carre's books but the movie "Munich."South Korean director Park Chan-wook exploits the international locales and the script wisely restores Charlie's status as an aspiring 20-something British actress as opposed to the American movie star that Diane Keaton played in the 1984 movie.Produced in association with the BBC -- a reunion with AMC after "The Night Manager" -- and scheduled over three successive nights the miniseries capitalizes on the format to flesh out the characters without sacrificing tension or pace.All told it's a fitting follow-up. And while le Carre's works have a long screen history when it comes to spinning his detailed yarns into miniseries the spies have it."Escape at Dannemora" premieres Nov. 18 at 10 p.m. on Showtime. "The Little Drummer Girl" premieres Nov. 19 at 9 p.m. on AMC.,Entertainment
 (CNN)"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" remains arguably the best of TV's animated Christmas specials. Yet the Chuck Jones/Dr. Seuss holiday classic is a model of storytelling economy whereas the new version "Dr. Seuss' The Grinch" captures sparks of that magic while straining to treble its size -- like the Grinch's small heart only here for theatrical purposes.In that regard this "Grinch" which features Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of the title character has a good deal in common with "The Lorax" another Illumination Entertainment adaptation of a Seuss staple which felt similarly labored in fleshing out its story.To its credit a few of the new elements in "The Grinch" are pretty nifty perhaps most notably an expanded visual representation of Whoville the idyllic town whose Christmas festivities become the object of the Grinch's ire. The other major additions are both new -- little Cindy Lou Who in this telling way more than two is now the concerned daughter of a single mom struggling to make ends meet -- and very old providing the Grinch an origin story that vaguely echoes why young Ebenezer Scrooge was so hostile to the holidays.Other tacked-on elements are colorful if fairly broad and garishly comedic from an overweight reindeer who becomes part of the Grinch's plot to an ebullient Whoville resident Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson) whose wholesale embrace of Christmas cheer represents everything that the Grinch isn't.Much of that feels like filler perhaps inevitably as the Grinch builds up to the idea of stealing the Whos' Christmas; devises an elaborate plan to execute his scheme; and finally comes to recognize the true spirit of the season which as Cindy Lou's mom (Rashida Jones) tells her is about more than mere "stuff."The heartwarming aspects have to work pretty hard to knife through the clutter and the uplifting ending -- while still good -- has been somewhat blunted in pursuit of a slightly more expansive message. Movie length also robs the Seuss-ian dialogue of some of its poetry even with a Pharrell Williams narration that draws heavily on the script from the original production.Finally there's Cumberbatch's voice work which involves adopting a slightly nasal twang that frankly won't make anybody forget Boris Karloff and really makes one yearn to hear the actor's resonant baritone British accent and all.The underlying bones of "The Grinch" are so solid the movie can't help but be moderately pleasing. But to borrow from another holiday special the commercial imperative to adorn the story with shiny baubles to suit the frenetic demands of modern animation is a bit like the little Christmas tree that Charlie Brown brings home to Linus and the gang. Yes it's nice to dress it up a bit but one bulb too many can potentially topple the whole thing."Dr. Seuss' The Grinch" premieres Nov. 9 in the U.S. It's rated PG.,Entertainment
 (CNN)Netflix has flashier shows but none better than "Narcos" which moves to a new chapter in its fourth season titled "Narcos: Mexico." Sweeping in scope the series remains as addictive as ever in chronicling the bleak history of the drug war delivering a drama so crisp and smartly executed as to provide its own kind of high.Although the setting and key characters have changed the common thread throughout has been the collateral damage the war on drugs has inflicted across decades -- an endless cycle of violence amid enforcement efforts that as the omniscient narration notes has claimed a half million lives.After beginning with Pablo Escobar in Colombia "Narcos" shifted to the Cali cartel an equally colorful and bloodthirsty bunch. The latest change of scenery adds considerable star power with Diego Luna as Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo the savvy drug lord seeking to consolidate power across Mexico in the 1980s; and Michael Pena as Kiki Camarena the gung-ho DEA agent who ultimately met a tragic end (previously turned into a 1990 miniseries)."Someone should call D.C. and tell them we surrendered Guadalajara" Camarena grouses early on chafing against what he sees as the handcuffs placed on his agency by feckless superiors.Both sides of the equation are fascinating with Gallardo seeking to forge an uneasy peace among the various drug kingpins -- in what only can be likened to the mob families parceling off Cuba in "The Godfather Part II" -- establishing Mexico's first narco-union. (Gallardo was appropriately known as "El Padrino" or "The Godfather.")Killing of 'Narcos' scout resurfaces Escobar trademark feudHeavily subtitled "Narcos" demands undivided attention for those who aren't fluent in Spanish but the series really derives its power from the unpredictability of the various factions and the corrosive influence of the huge money that illegal drugs generate. That also produces some darkly comic moments such as one of Gallardo's lieutenants meeting with a realtor at a gigantic mansion asking "Do you accept cash?"Given the mercurial nature of the players even a criminal mastermind like Gallardo can't possibly foresee all the angles grappling with corrupt officials ancient grudges and regional feuds that complicate every effort to cement deals even when they're to everyone's mutual advantage. The show also cleverly builds on prior seasons while throwing in tantalizing tidbits like introducing El Chapo -- a small-time soldier destined for bigger more infamous things -- whose trial in New York is a reminder how current this all is. "I can't tell you how the drug war ends" the narrator says at the outset. "Man I can't even tell you if it ends."That line dovetails nicely with producer Eric Newman's comment a few seasons ago about the show's longevity beyond the Escobar storyline saying that the writers needn't worry about running out of material until "cocaine stops." While that's hardly a reassuring thought while watching the carnage the drug war unleashed in terms of delivering quality TV mission accomplished and then some."Narcos: Mexico" premieres Nov. 16 on Netflix.,Entertainment
New York (CNN)President Trump insulted three reporters affiliated with CNN on Friday and said the White House may continue to take press passes away from members of the media.Trump's unprecedented threat poses a serious challenge to the White House press corps and the association that represents them.The White House suspended CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass on Wednesday night hours after Acosta pressed Trump at a press conference. At a Q&A session on Friday morning when a reporter asked Trump "How long are you going to leave Jim Acosta in the penalty box?" he said "I haven't made that decision but it could be others also."Unprompted Trump brought up April Ryan the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks who doubles as a CNN analyst. "You talk about somebody that's a loser she doesn't know what the hell she's doing" Trump said. "She gets publicity and then she gets a pay raise or she gets a contract with I think CNN." (Ryan has been a regular on CNN for a year and a half.)"But she's very nasty and she shouldn't be. She shouldn't be" Trump said. "You've gotta treat the White House and the office of the presidency with respect."In between his calls for "respect" Trump called Acosta "unprofessional" and disparaged the reporter's intelligence. Trump also cast doubt on the stated rationale for stripping Acosta's credential.  The White House originally claimed that Acosta placed his hands on an intern who tried to take a microphone from him. Press secretary Sarah Sanders called it "inappropriate behavior." The video proved otherwise. CNN said Sanders' explanation a lie. On Friday Trump said of Acosta "He was not nice to that young woman." But then he said "I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly you know horrible." Separately he called out Acosta's tense exchanges with Sanders at past press briefings saying "it's a disgrace" suggesting the retaliation was about more than Wednesday's press conference. CNN has been working behind the scenes on a resolution that would restore Acosta's pass. In the meantime Acosta has continued to report without physical access to the White House grounds; he is currently in Paris to cover Trump's trip to France.A number of prominent journalism advocacy groups have come to Acosta's defense and called for an immediate restoration of his press pass. But some journalists — concerned about which reporter might be targeted next — have been calling for action to match the words. On Friday the Boston Globe's editorial board called for a White House press walkout.Richard Tofel the president of ProPublica tweeted on Friday morning "What is the plan for when Trump concocts an excuse for vetoing a reporter" from the New York Times or Washington Post? "Surely" he wrote "we must realize that if it works with CNN this will just be the first time and not the last."CNN's other White House reporters and producers have been unaffected by the action against Acosta. But in effect the White House is trying to veto Acosta."At every good news organization of which I've been aware over 35 years in and around journalism it has been a bedrock principle that subjects don't get to choose the reporters who cover them which includes not getting to veto reporters they don't like" Tofel wrote. At Friday's Q&A session Trump also had sharp words for CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip.  She asked one of the day's key questions about newly appointed acting attorney general Matt Whitaker: "Do you want him to rein in Robert Mueller?"Instead of answering the question Trump said "What a stupid question you asked. What a stupid question and I watch you a lot and you ask a lot of stupid questions." (Trump has previously said he doesn't watch CNN.)CNN's Dana Bash tweeted this reaction: "Harvard University will be surprised to hear POTUS call one of their graduates — my friend and colleague Abby Phillip - stupid. In fact she asked THE KEY SMART question: does he want his acting AG to mess with Mueller probe — one he calls a witch hunt."Phillip and Ryan are two of a small number of African American women who cover the White House. The president has a long history of insulting the intelligence of women and people of color.Earlier this week Trump snapped at another African American woman Yamiche Alcindor of PBS and accused her of asking a "racist question." Her question was about the widespread concerns that Trump's rhetoric emboldens white nationalists.On Twitter Astead Wesley of The New York Times connected the dots between the different incidents."There are embarrassingly few black and hispanic reporters in the WH press corps and four have been personally insulted by the President this week" he wrote.After Friday morning's Q&A session Ryan called into CNN and said she shook off his insults.A 20-year veteran of the White House beat Ryan pointed out that each president before Trump "understood that reporters were part of the underpinnings of this nation."Trump she said doesn't seem to appreciate that.,Entertainment
 (CNN)Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos didn't have a lot of details to offer on the projects being prepped by Barack and Michelle Obama for his streaming service but indicated that the content won't necessarily be "political." "They want to do storytelling that is fitting with the things [they] have done with the presidency obviously but [also] the experiences they've had throughout their entire lives" Sarandos told the crowd at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit on Tuesday. Sarandos said the content will hit on subjects like sports lifestyle and nutrition. Echoing the information shared in the deal's original announcement Sarandos said the former president and first lady have "got their eyes on film and television fiction and nonfiction."  The Obamas deal with the streaming giant was formally announced back in May. At the time of the announcement the Obamas said in a statement that they were looking forward to harnessing "the power of storytelling" to promote common values.Sources told CNN back in May that the Obamas would possibly be appearing on camera as moderators or hosts. Sarandos said he hoped on-camera appearances were in the cards but said current projects have them serving as executive producers and doing some voice over work. He added that the streaming network would have "a lot to talk about later this year" regarding its slate of Obama projects. ,Entertainment
Hong Kong (CNN Business)"Crazy Rich Asians" is finally getting a run in China's lucrative movie market. The romantic comedy is scheduled to hit theaters in mainland China on November 30 Warner Bros. said Tuesday.  There had been some doubt about whether the movie with a plot that features incredibly rich and privileged Asians would get the go-ahead from China's film regulator. The Chinese government has in recent years frowned on anything that could be interpreted as a celebration of ostentatious wealth. Experts have also questioned whether the film's depiction of high-rolling members of the Chinese diaspora in Singapore would resonate with audiences in mainland China.But Warner Bros. isn't playing down the crazy rich aspect of its movie. The studio announced the movie's Chinese release on social media with the promise of "yachts parties high-end lifestyle!"China's movie regulator typically allows only 34 foreign films to be shown in theaters each year. Scoring one of those coveted slots can significantly boost a movie's global box office returns. Several big budget Hollywood films like "Ready Player One" and "Black Panther" had bigger debuts in China than in North America. "Crazy Rich Asians" has a different title for China that roughly translates as "Tales of Gold Digging." That's at odds with the movie's storyline in which the main character is initially clueless about her Singaporean boyfriend's incredible family wealth. When it came to Hong Kong in late August the title was translated to "My Super Rich Boyfriend."In the United States the movie was lauded for featuring an all-Asian cast at a time when Hollywood has come under fire for its lack of diversity. In China where the majority of films feature all-Asian casts that's much less remarkable. Warner Bros. didn't respond to a request for comment on whether any changes had been made to the film at the request of the Chinese regulator.The makers of "Crazy Rich Asians" had been hoping for a run in the world's second largest movie market. "We're all praying to the China gods right now" producer John Penotti said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in August. "From my colleagues in Beijing it looks like we're in strong consideration." "Crazy Rich Asians" was a late summer hit in the United States and has since released in dozens of countries from Australia to Venezuela. It has made $228 million worldwide so far.

New York (CNN Business)The final season of "Game of Thrones" isn't airing until 2019 but the race is already underway to find the next king of television.Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon and more traditional networks like CBS are spending millions of dollars to find the next series that will fill the giant hole "Game of Thrones" will leave behind. But they all may be chasing something increasingly elusive: a universal hit. When "Game of Thrones" premiered on HBO in 2011 it had far less competition — streaming services weren't as popular as they are today."You're trying to break through the clutter of 500 shows with one great show" Michael Nathanson media analyst and founding partner at MoffettNathanson told CNN Business. A hit show can lead to more subscribers and clout for the network according to Nathanson."Game of Thrones'" engaging storytelling immersive world and enormous production budget has led to 47 EmmysAmazon is bringing "Lord of the Rings" to the small screen for a reported price tag that could reach $500 million. One of Disney's big bets for its new streaming service is a "Star Wars" series which has a reported budget of roughly $100 million for 10 episodes. Both of those franchises have made billions at the box office but the jury is still out on whether they can find that level of success on TV. All Access CBS' streaming service wants to make a name for itself with a "Twilight Zone" reboot from "Get Out" director Jordan Peele and a "Star Trek" series that has Patrick Stewart returning as Captain Picard. Both are beloved brands that have been around for decades but it's not yet clear if they can court a new generation of fans.And HBO is future-proofing for its life after "Thrones" with its adaptation of Alan Moore's "Watchmen" which is one of the most critically praised graphic novels ever. The cable network is also hoping to stay in the "Game of Thrones" business after the show ends with a prequel based on the series.WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey has said HBO needs to substantially increase its subscriber base by creating more engaging content. (HBO like CNN is owned by WarnerMedia.)"We need hours a day" Stankey said in July about the time viewers spend watching HBO programming according to the New York Times. "You are competing with devices that sit in people's hands that capture their attention every 15 minutes."Streaming services are still gunning for that "one signature breakout hit" but they will need a lot more content to keep a global audience engaged according to Nathanson.But volume alone isn't enough. Stankey's boss AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has implied that prestige is an important factor for success. He knocked Netflix by comparing it to Walmart while comparing HBO to Tiffany's.Jill Rosengard Hill an executive vice president at Magid a research-based media firm told CNN Business that the future of subscription TV will probably be a mix of quality and quantity."Streaming services need volume with both diverse originals and a large library of acquired shows and movies to give the consumer more bang for their subscription bucks" she said.Sonia Saraiya TV critic at Vanity Fair believes that HBO's "Watchmen" may have the best shot at being the next big thing because it's helmed by Damon Lindelof who has proven to be a good storyteller. He was a co-creator of "Lost" and already has "really successful source material." "My guess is that what makes something be the next 'Game of Thrones' is something that really goes in a totally different direction" Saraiya said. "Like something that isn't trying to recreate that success but something that is going for a very clear and unique vision.",Entertainment
